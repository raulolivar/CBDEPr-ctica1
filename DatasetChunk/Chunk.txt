"usually , he would be tearing around the living room , playing with his toys ."
"but just one look at a minion sent him practically catatonic ."
"that had been megan 's plan when she got him dressed earlier ."
"he 'd seen the movie almost by mistake , considering he was a little young for the pg cartoon , but with older cousins , along with her brothers , mason was often exposed to things that were older ."
"she liked to think being surrounded by adults and older kids was one reason why he was a such a good talker for his age ."
"`` are n't you being a good boy ? ''"
"she said ."
"mason barely acknowledged her ."
"instead , his baby blues remained focused on the television ."
"since the movie was almost over , megan knew she better slip into the bedroom and finish getting ready ."
"each time she looked into mason 's face , she was grateful that he looked nothing like his father ."
"his platinum blond hair and blue eyes were completely hers ."
"it was only his build that he was taking after his father ."
"where megan was a diminutive 5'3 '' , davis was 6'1 '' and two hundred pounds ."
"mason was already registering off the charts in height and weight according to his pediatrician ."
"davis had seen mason only twice in his lifetime-the day he had been born and the day he came home from the hospital ."
"after that , he had n't been interested in any of the pictures and emails megan sent ."
"with his professional football career on the rise , davis had n't wanted to be shackled with the responsibilities of a baby ."
"instead , he wanted to spend his time off the field partying until all hours of the night ."
"he only paid child support when megan threatened to have his wages garnished ."
"she dreaded the day when mason was old enough to ask about his father ."
"she never wanted anything in the world to hurt him , and she knew that being rejected by his father would ."
"with a sigh , she stepped into the dress and slid it over her hips ."
"wrestling around to get the zipper all the way up caused her to huff and puff ."
"standing back from the mirror , she turned to and fro to take in her appearance ."
"she 'd always loved how the dress made her feel sexy , but at the same time was very respectable ."
"while it boasted a sweetheart neckline , the hemline fell just below her knees ."
"she put on her pearls-a high school graduation gift from her uncle aidan , or `` ankle '' , as she often called him ."
"aidan was her mother 's baby brother and only son of the family ."
"when she was born , he was only eight and a half ."
"as the first grandchild , megan spent a lot of time with her grandparents , and that in turn , meant she spent a lot of time with aidan ."
"he had devoted hours to holding her and spoiling her rotten ."
"when it came time for her to talk , she just could n't seem to get `` uncle aidan '' out ."
"instead , she called him `` ankle . ''"
"it was a nickname that had stuck with him even now that he was thirty-four and married ."
"while it had been no question that she wanted him as godfather for mason , she had been extremely honored when he and his wife , emma , had asked her to be their son , noah 's , godmother ."
"she loved her newest cousin very much and planned to be the best godmother she could for him ."
"as she stepped out of the bedroom , she found that mason had yet to move ."
"`` okay buddy , time to go . ''"
"when he started to whine , she shook her head ."
"`` we have such a fun day ahead of us ."
"it 's noah 's baptism , and then there 's a party at uncle aidan and aunt emma 's house . ''"
"`` beau ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she laughed ."
"`` yes , you 'll get to see and play with beau , too . ''"
"as she went to the couch and picked him up , she could n't help finding it amusing that out of everyone he was going to see today , he was most excited about being with aidan and emma 's black lab , beau ."
"one day when they had their own place again , she would get him a dog ."
"he loved them too much to be denied ."
"`` oomph , '' she muttered , as they started up the basement stairs ."
"`` heawy ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` yes , you 're getting to be such a big , heavy boy . ''"
"when they made it to the kitchen , megan paused to catch her breath ."
"she only had a second before her mother breezed in with sean , and her youngest brother , gavin ."
"`` ready ? ''"
"she asked ."
"megan nodded ."
"feeling like she was once again a teenager , she filed behind her parents as they headed into the garage ."
"`` i want to drive , '' gavin said ."
"with a smirk , sean replied , `` like i 'm gon na let you drive my car . ''"
"he then slid into the driver 's seat as gavin reluctantly walked around to the passenger 's side ."
"`` we 'll see you there in just a few , '' her mother called ."
"sean acknowledged her with a two finger salute before cranking up and pulling down the driveway ."
"megan worked to get mason into the car seat in her parents ' land rover ."
"once he was safely strapped and buckled in , she hopped in beside him ."
"her parents rattled along to each other as they made their way through the tree-lined suburbs where megan had grown up ."
"while some might look on her as having a mark against her character being an unwed mother , she had lived a relatively non-rebellious life ."
"even though she 'd been a cheerleader and ran with the popular crowd in school , she rarely partied to excess ."
"instead , she had focused on getting good grades ."
"at that time , she had her heart set on going to medical school and becoming a doctor ."
"from the time she was a little girl , she had wanted nothing more than to help people ."
"she was always mending birds with broken wings or trying to resuscitate squirrels who had been hit by cars ."
"she ditched playing princess for playing `` hospital . ''"
"her desire to become a doctor was why she needed the best scores and best activities and why she generally shunned any temptations to lead her off the right path ."
"she had even managed to bypass the usual freshman craziness when she went off to the university of georgia ."
"it was n't until she fell in love for the first time in her life that she threw everything away ."
"sadly , she could n't say that her first love was davis , mason 's father ."
"instead , it was another football player , this time a running back at uga , who captured and later broke her heart a year later ."
"carsyn ran with the fast crowd , and when she was with him , she partied and drank too much ."
"he was controlling and possessive , and he wanted all of her time ."
"when she was with him , she had little time for studying ."
"with her grades already in the toilet , she was unprepared for the emotional breakdown she experienced when carsyn broke up with her ."
"devastated , she stopped going to class and ended up flunking the semester ."
"by the time she got back on track with her grades , she had abandoned any hope of medical school ."
"instead , she decided that she would become a nurse , which would fulfill her need to care for sick people ."
"of course , her relationship with davis ended up derailing shortly before graduation when she got pregnant unexpectedly ."
"she had to take several semesters off after mason was born ."
"she was a few years off from when she had originally planned on graduating , but she was excited after everything had that had happened , she was finally finishing ."
"her mother 's voice brought megan out of her thoughts ."
"`` here we are , '' she said pleasantly ."
"leaning forward in her seat , megan eyed the clock on the dashboard ."
"she was n't surprised to see they had arrived half an hour before the baptism started ."
"one thing her mother prided herself on was being on time and lending a hand ."
"as they started into the church , her mother reached for mason ."
"`` we 'll take him so you can go see if emma needs any help . ''"
"megan bent over to kiss mason 's cheek ."
"`` see you in a little while , sweetie . ''"
"he grinned and then happily dodged her mother 's arms for her father 's instead , which made megan smile ."
"he was such a man 's man already ."
"he loved sitting between her brothers on the couch and watching tv ."
"while it was good that he had so many male role models , she only hoped he had n't inherited too much of his father 's personality ."
"after megan watched them disappear in the crowd of family and friends waiting in the church alcove , she bypassed everyone by turning right and heading down the hallway ."
"at the last door on the right , she knocked ."
"`` it 's me , megan . ''"
"emma 's best friend , casey , answered the door ."
"`` well , if it is n't the fairy godmother , '' she mused with a grin ."
"after megan stepped inside , casey threw her arms around her ."
"megan had only met her a few times , but it was hard not liking emma 's vivacious and outgoing friend ."
"casey 's long brown hair was pulled back in a lose knot , and she wore a demure black slip dress and heels ."
"`` so how 's it going ? ''"
"megan asked , gazing from noah 's diapered but na**d form to emma ."
"she was feeding him a bottle while her upper body was draped in a towel ."
"peeking out from the covering , she saw emma was wearing her signature color , green ."
"as noah sucked on his bottle , he twirled a strand of emma 's auburn hair between his fingers ."
"both father and son were fans of emma wearing her hair down ."
"emma grinned ."
"`` good , i guess ."
"i mean , i do n't have a lot of experience with baptisms . ''"
"megan laughed and motioned to the towel and noah ."
"`` it looks like you 're taking all the proper precautions-nothing like spit-up on your dress or his . ''"
"with a nod , emma replied , `` tell me about it ."
"especially since his gown is so old . ''"
"megan eyed the lacy baptismal gown hanging on the closet door ."
"she recognized it from pictures of ankle 's baptism ."
"he had worn it , and now it was being passed down to his son ."
"casey snorted ."
"`` i 'm sure aidan would n't appreciate you alluding to the fact his gown is an antique , thus in turn saying he 's old . ''"
"emma laughed ."
"`` no , i 'm sure he would n't ."
"of course , he 'd probably argue that while the gown might not have held up , he still looks fabulous and much younger than his age . ''"
"megan smiled ."
"`` that sounds just like him . ''"
"she bent over emma to rub one of noah 's hands ."
"he grabbed her thumb in his fist and held on for dear life ."
"`` aw , you love your godmother , do n't you noah ? ''"
"emma asked ."
"noah momentarily stopped sucking on the bottle to flash a quick smile , which warmed megan 's heart ."
"`` he 's such a sweet boy , '' she mused ."
"`` and a charmer , just like his old man , '' casey mused ."
"`` that too , '' megan agreed ."
"thinking about her position , she cocked her head at casey ."
"`` are you sure you 're fine with me being the godmother ? ''"
"casey waved her hand dismissively ."
"`` honey , the last thing i need is the responsibility ."
"i plan on spoiling noah rotten and corrupting him as only a good auntie can do ! ''"
"emma rolled her eyes ."
"`` i 'm very satisfied with both my choices , megan ."
"you do n't have to worry . ''"
"`` so who is the godfather again ?"
"i know he 's not part of the family . ''"
"casey gasped as her hand flew to her chest dramatically ."
"`` you mean , you 've never met dr. mcdreamy bollywood ? ''"
"megan shrugged ."
"`` no , i have n't ."
"i mean , i 've heard about him and how he flew aidan home in time for noah 's birth . ''"
"she noticed the pleading look that emma exchanged with casey ."
"`` why ?"
"what should i know about him ? ''"
"casey tapped her chin with her index finger ."
"`` hmm , what should you know about the good godfather ? ''"
"she winked at megan ."
"`` first off , he is seriously delectable ."
"i mean , the man is like sex on a stick ."
"tall , jet-black hair , dark eyes , and he 's built like a brick shithouse . ''"
"megan suddenly felt her interest piquing ."
"she had n't imagined that the godfather would be good-looking ."
"it had been such a long time since she had dated anyone ."
"scratch that-it had been a long time since she 'd had sex with anyone ."
"she 'd spent the last two years completely dateless since she and davis broke up ."
"she could practically join one of the local parishes as a nun with how long she had abstained ."
"`` really ? ''"
"`` mmm , hmm ."
"he reminds me of that bollywood actor john abraham , '' casey said ."
"emma snorted ."
"`` since when do you watch bollywood movies ? ''"
"`` since one of nate 's friends asked us to an indian film festival . ''"
"casey grinned at megan ."
"`` besides the fact that he 's a serious looker , he 's also kind , compassionate , and caring-an overall wonderful man . ''"
"`` really now ? ''"
"megan questioned ."
"`` and he 's loaded because he 's a doctor . ''"
"this man was sounding better and better by the minute ."
"`` is he single ? ''"
"emma made a strangled noise before casey replied , `` oh , yeah , he 's single ."
"he 's a widower actually . ''"
"megan pursed her lips at the prospect ."
"widowers usually fell into two categories-those who were still devastated by their wives ' deaths or those who were ready to have fun and live a little ."
"she certainly hoped this pesh guy fell into the second category ."
"more than anything , she wanted to have a little fun herself ."
"`` do you really think you might be interested in dating pesh ? ''"
"emma asked , as she moved noah to her shoulder to burp him ."
"with a shrug , megan replied , `` dating him or just having some fun with him ."
"sounds like he could use some . ''"
"emma grimaced as she wiped noah 's face off ."
"`` this is exactly why i told aidan not to try and fix you two up . ''"
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"`` pesh needs a relationship , not a hook-up after all he 's been through ."
"besides his wife 's death , he has n't had it easy on the dating front . ''"
"`` what happened ? ''"
"when casey snorted , emma shot her a death glare ."
"`` nothing ."
"it 's just he does n't need to get involved with someone who is n't interested in a long-term relationship . ''"
"`` em , you might as well tell her , '' casey urged ."
"megan glanced between the two of them ."
"`` tell me what ? ''"
"`` fine , '' emma huffed resignedly ."
"she handed noah to casey ."
"`` make yourself useful by changing his diaper . ''"
"as casey got busy cleaning up noah , emma turned to megan ."
"`` when aidan and i broke up- '' `` what you meant to say is , after you left aidan when he did n't show up for noah 's gender ultrasound because he was cheating on you ? ''"
"casey interrupted , waving around the wet wipe in her hand ."
"emma closed her eyes for a moment before shaking her head ."
"`` yes , that 's right ."
"thank you so very much for bringing up that aspect of our break-up on today of all days . ''"
"casey gripped noah 's ankles and hoisted up his little butt to slide on the new diaper ."
"`` you 're welcome . ''"
"`` anyway , as you were saying , '' megan pressed ."
"`` right ."
"so it was when aidan and i were broken up that i met pesh ."
"i was with your papa fitzgerald the day of his heart attack at the vfw , and pesh was the doctor who treated him . ''"
"`` so ... you both struck up a friendship then ? ''"
"megan asked ."
"emma grimaced ."
"`` not exactly ."
"you see , patrick wanted to force aidan to really fight for me , and he felt the best way to do it would be for him to have some competition . ''"
"megan felt her eyes widening in surprise ."
"`` papa wanted pesh to date you ? ''"
"`` yeah . ''"
"`` did you ? ''"
"emma was momentarily distracted by casey blowing raspberries on noah 's stomach ."
"a smile spread across her face as noah kicked his legs and giggled at casey ."
"`` want me to get him in his dress ? ''"
"casey asked , as she glanced up ."
"`` if you do n't mind . ''"
"bringing her hand to her hip , megan huffed out an exasperated breath ."
"`` um , could you please focus for just a minute considering the bomb you just dropped on me ? ''"
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i did n't want to tell you at all ."
"i mean , whatever was between us is all in the past ."
"neither one of us really cared for each other like we thought we did . ''"
"`` did you ... '' megan said ."
"at emma 's confused expression , she wiggled her eyebrows suggestively ."
"emma 's face flushed ."
"`` no , of course not ! ''"
"casey eyed emma as she took the baptism gown off the hanger ."
"`` you did make out with him though . ''"
"`` one time ."
"and he certainly did n't get to second base , '' emma argued ."
"with a wicked grin , casey added , `` pity ."
"wish you could inform us on what he has going on below the waist . ''"
"emma rolled her eyes ."
"`` you 're impossible . ''"
"she snatched the gown away from casey and then started wrestling noah into the yards of fabric ."
"`` it was n't like we were in a relationship ."
"we did n't really even go out together ."
"he came to the house once to bring me dinner and check on me when i was on bed rest , and then he took me to the opera ."
"that was it . ''"
"`` was there no chemistry between you two ? ''"
"megan asked ."
"without responding , emma pulled noah up into a sitting position and started fastening the row of buttons down the back of the gown ."
"`` em ? ''"
"megan pressed ."
"she gave a heavy sigh before picking noah up ."
"she stared into his face before she responded ."
"`` we had great chemistry together ."
"he was an amazing kisser who got all my senses up and running in all the right ways ."
"besides the physical part , he is smart , kind , and intelligent-any woman 's dream . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` but it did n't matter because he was n't aidan ."
"i could never , ever love another man like i do him . ''"
"giving noah a kiss on the cheek , she added , `` neither one of us were really in a good place-i was trying to make sure that aidan really was the one , and after being pressured by family and friends , he was trying to date for the first time after his wife 's death . ''"
"megan crossed her arms over her chest ."
"`` i get that he does n't need to be hurt , but who is to say that having a fling is going to hurt him ?"
"maybe it could give him the confidence he needs to go out and find the real woman of his dreams ? ''"
"casey snorted ."
"`` how could a man that looks like that have any self-confidence issues ? ''"
"megan shrugged ."
"`` you never know ."
"if he was married a long time before his wife died , he might find it hard to get back into the dating world ."
"especially if the last woman he cared about loved someone else . ''"
"emma shook her head ."
"`` trust me , he is n't the fling kind of guy ."
"he wants a wife and children . ''"
"although megan had a son , she was n't quite ready for marriage ."
"maybe in a few years but right now she just wanted to date and have fun ."
"she 'd willingly sacrificed so much to ensure that mason could have all of her attention since he was short a father ."
"after all , he was the greatest hurdle in her having a committed relationship ."
"she did n't want to open her son up to any hurt that might come from him getting attached to a man she dated only to have them disappear when they broke up ."
"`` ankle really wants to fix us up ? ''"
"megan questioned ."
"emma nodded ."
"`` regardless of what happened with pesh when we were broken up , aidan does respect and admire him ."
"he wants pesh to be happy . ''"
"she gave megan a pointed look ."
"`` most of all , he wants that for you , too . ''"
"megan wrinkled her nose ."
"`` but i 'm really not ready for all of that yet . ''"
"`` then think long and hard before you agree to do anything about pesh ."
"he is unknowingly very persuasive , and in the moment , you might forget your resolve only to have it come back later to hurt you ... or him . ''"
"megan held up her hands in defeat ."
"`` okay , okay , i promise . ''"
"emma smiled ."
"`` nothing would make me happier than if you were to fall in love with pesh . ''"
"with a laugh , megan said , `` did you just hear anything that i said ?"
"i 'm anti-love . ''"
"`` so was aidan . ''"
"just as megan opened her mouth to protest , aidan waltzed into the room ."
"`` everything okay ? ''"
"`` fine ."
"just finished feeding and dressing him , '' emma replied `` good ."
"the natives are getting restless to see the little man of the hour before the baptism . ''"
"he strode over to them and took his son into his arms ."
"`` you ready to go work the crowd , noah ? ''"
"noah 's response was to grunt and reach for aidan 's tie ."
"with a laugh , aidan announced , `` i 'll take that as a yes . ''"
"he then leaned in to kiss emma 's cheek ."
"`` ready mrs ."
"fitzgerald ? ''"
"she smiled before linking her arm through his ."
"`` yes , mr. fitzgerald , i am . ''"
"megan and casey followed them out the door and down the hallway ."
"they entered a noisy room crammed with family and friends ."
"she left aidan and emma 's side to seek out her parents to check on mason ."
"she found her parents , but their arms were empty ."
"in a panic , she demanded , `` where 's mason ? ''"
"her father smiled and pointed over to where a pile of her younger cousins were ."
"mason was on the lap of her aunt becky 's oldest son , john ."
"mason was mesmerized with what whatever john was doing on his phone ."
"megan smiled as she walked up to them ."
"`` everything okay ? ''"
"without taking his eyes off the screen , john replied , `` we 're fine . ''"
"`` are you sure he 's not bothering you ? ''"
"what she was n't asking was if john was actually keeping an eye on mason between playing on his phone ."
"john glanced up ."
"`` considering i have two younger brothers , i think i can handle him ."
"besides , he 's really into this game . ''"
"`` okay then , '' megan replied ."
"she spoke to john 's brothers , percy and georgie , before making her way around the room ."
"all her relatives were interested to hear how her schooling was going and how mason was ."
"she had just turned away from talking to her great aunt and uncle when someone pressed up against her back ."
"`` do n't look now , but there 's dr. mcdreamy bollywood now , '' casey whispered into her ear ."
"without hesitation , her eyes scanned the crowd ."
"and then she saw him ."
"ankle was taking him around and making introductions ."
"pesh was impossibly tall and wearing a tailor-made black suit ."
"even beneath the lines of the clothing , she could make out his large biceps and thick thighs ."
"he obviously spent his downtime between hospital shifts working out ."
"his wavy , jet-black hair was cut short , and his dark eyes took in all that ankle was saying ."
"and while she may have been in a church about to stand up as a godmother , she could n't help the ni**les tightening and panties moistening reaction of seeing him ."
"he was all the way across the room , but he had the same effect as if he were standing by her side , rubbing against her ."
"`` see what i mean ? ''"
"casey questioned ."
"megan licked her lips ."
"`` oh my , '' she finally managed ."
"`` sure you do n't want to give him a chance ? ''"
"fighting the urge to fan herself , megan quickly replied , `` i 'd like to give him many , many chances . ''"
"chances at ripping off my clothes , chances at kissing and licking me all over my body , chances at allowing his hands , fingers , and the promising bulge in his pants to stroke me until i orgasm ... yep , many , many chances ."
"as if she could read megan 's mind , casey laughed ."
"`` oh girl , this has trouble written all over it . ''"
"chapter three pesh paced nervously around the back of the cathedral ."
"the fact he was in a catholic church was n't the only reason he felt out of his element ."
"as he eyed the massive statue of jesus , he fidgeted absently with his tie ."
"although emma had sworn aidan was fine with the idea of him as godfather , he was still a little apprehensive about seeing aidan again ."
"the last time they 'd been together , pesh was the hero flying aidan from north carolina to atlanta just in time for noah 's unexpected birth ."
"but that was six months ago ."
"the euphoria of the moment now had time to fade , and to aidan , pesh could still be the man who almost stole emma away ."
"a side door opened , and aidan stepped out ."
"he immediately met pesh 's anxious gaze ."
"when his lips curved into a wide smile , pesh exhaled the nervous breath he 'd been holding ."
"`` well , there you are , '' aidan said , as he strode up ."
"he bypassed throwing out his hand , and instead , he pulled pesh to him for a bear hug ."
"`` emma was worried about you . ''"
"`` she was ? ''"
"`` yeah , she asked me to come out and see if i could find you . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i was n't sure where to go , and no one was out here . ''"
"`` do n't worry about it . ''"
"aidan pulled away ."
"`` so how the hell are you ? ''"
"pesh could n't help laughing at aidan 's choice of words , especially in a church ."
"`` i 'm good , thank you . ''"
"he cocked his head at aidan ."
"`` and what about you ?"
"is fatherhood agreeing with you ? ''"
"a beaming smile lit aidan 's face ."
"`` i 'm absolutely fantastic ."
"i never could have imagined that being a father would be this ... amazing . ''"
"pesh nodded ."
"`` i want you to know what an honor it is for me to be noah 's godfather . ''"
"`` we 're glad to have you . ''"
"aidan patted pesh 's back ."
"`` and i do mean that . ''"
"`` i hope you do ."
"i have had my concerns ... '' aidan shook his head ."
"`` well , do n't ."
"i 'll admit i was n't too thrilled with the prospect at first , but em was able to make me see the light ."
"you were there for us when we really needed you ."
"i mean , besides my wedding day , i would 've missed the most important days of my life-my son 's birth ."
"i can never thank you enough ."
"so when it comes down to it , i do n't think i could ask for a better godfather for my son . ''"
"aidan 's words touched pesh ."
"`` thank you ."
"that means a lot ."
"you have my word that i will always do what is right by noah . ''"
"after giving him a hearty thump on the shoulder , aidan said , `` come on back with me ."
"i want to introduce you to everyone . ''"
"`` do they ... '' pesh was n't sure how to ask if aidan 's family knew the story of how he and emma truly knew each other ."
"aidan chuckled ."
"`` let 's just say that pop 's the only one who knows the truth ."
"the others just think you met us when pop had his heart attack . ''"
"pesh could n't help the relieved breath that whooshed out of him ."
"it would have been a nightmare to have most of aidan 's family hating him for trying to steal emma away ."
"`` i see . ''"
"he followed aidan back into a large room filled with chattering people ."
"as he craned his neck , he saw emma in the corner with noah in her arms ."
"she looked radiant as ever in an emerald suit ."
"noah , however , did n't seem too thrilled to be outfitted in the lacy gown that flowed over emma 's arms and stopped mid-thigh ."
"his tiny brows wrinkled as he waved his fists back and forth as if any moment he might let loose with a scream ."
"taking him by the elbow , aidan guided him over to a group of men and women ."
"aidan introduced him to his four sisters and their husbands ."
"pesh smiled , nodded , and shook their hands before being bombarded by a hoard of aidan 's nieces and nephews ."
"`` now i want you to meet my niece , megan ."
"she 's the godmother . ''"
"`` it would be my pleasure . ''"
"aidan surprised pesh by leaning in and whispering in his ear ."
"`` i 'm pretty sure over half of the people here are gunning for you two to get together ."
"you know , a real romantic story to tell future kids about how you two met being the godmother and godfather of this sweet and adorable kid . ''"
"pesh gulped ."
"why was everyone he knew hell-bent on setting him up ?"
"had emma harbored some secret , ulterior motive in asking him to be noah 's godfather ?"
"`` i 'm flattered , but i do n't know if that 's such a good idea . ''"
"pulling back , aidan surmised him before winking ."
"`` normally i would agree because she is , after all , my niece-my favorite one if i 'm being honest ."
"but as much as it pisses me off to admit it , you two would make a great couple . ''"
"`` we would ? ''"
"`` hell yeah . ''"
"aidan swept his hand over his chin ."
"`` megan needs someone strong and stable like you are , and then you need someone who is so full of life like she is ."
"i can guaran-damn-tee you that you 've never been out with a woman like her before ."
"emma is like , one tenths the sassiness that megan is . ''"
"pesh could n't help giving aidan a skeptical look ."
"`` just keep an open mind , okay ? ''"
"with a reluctant nod , pesh replied , `` i will . ''"
"`` megan , '' aidan called ."
"when the tiny blonde turned around , pesh fought to catch his breath ."
"everything about her from her sparkling blue eyes to her long blonde hair was just like jade 's ."
"how was it possible for someone to remind him so much of what he had lost ?"
"aidan grinned as he glanced between the two of them ."
"`` i wanted to introduce you to pesh nadeen , the godfather . ''"
"thrusting out her hand , megan smiled warmly at him ."
"`` it 's very nice to finally meet you . ''"
"he stared at it a moment before his good manners overrode his shock ."
"he took her hand in his and shook it ."
"`` it 's very nice meeting you , too . ''"
"`` i 'll leave you two to get to know each other , '' aidan said ."
"before pesh could protest , aidan turned and disappeared into the crowd ."
"he turned to megan and tried clearing his throat of what felt like a wad of sawdust ."
"he knew he should try to make polite conversation , but he was still so shell-shocked by the way megan looked ."
"finally , she took pity on him ."
"`` so , emma tells me you 're a doctor . ''"
"pesh smiled politely ."
"`` yes , i am . ''"
"`` what type of medicine ? ''"
"`` emergency services . ''"
"megan 's face lit up ."
"`` oh , how interesting ."
"i 'm about to finish nursing school , and i 've asked for clinical placement in the er . ''"
"pesh widened his eyes in surprise ."
"aidan had failed to mention that they had the medical profession in common ."
"`` really ? ''"
"megan nodded ."
"`` i 'm hoping to get placed at grady , even though my parents would die a thousand deaths . ''"
"he cocked his brows at her ."
"`` i assume they 're afraid for your safety ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"they ca n't help worrying about the neighborhood ."
"they sometimes forget i 'm an adult , rather than a child . ''"
"`` what is it about grady that attracts you ? ''"
"`` besides the fact that it 's nationally recognized for its er ? ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` yes , besides the accolades . ''"
"megan tilted her head in thought ."
"`` i guess it 's the fact i really want to feel like i 'm making a difference and saving lives ."
"i feel like at grady i would be seeing some of the worst cases imaginable , and in turn some people who really do n't have a lot of hope . ''"
"he was taken aback by her words and the passion with which she delivered them ."
"while she possessed a beautiful exterior , she certainly seemed to have a greater depth of character than he had originally expected ."
"he did n't often meet someone like her ."
"most of the women at the hospital who threw themselves at him possessed only surface beauty ."
"he did n't have to be with them very long to perceive their true shallowness and self-centeredness ."
"to them , he was a prize to be won ."
"he could n't ever imagine megan feeling that way ."
"she was n't the type of woman to care about a trophy man on her arm-she wanted to make her own way in the world ."
"`` it is so good to hear someone speak with such passion about nursing . ''"
"`` really ? ''"
"he nodded ."
"`` we desperately need more people like you ."
"i know i would love to work alongside someone who had your passion . ''"
"she smiled at his compliments ."
"he could n't help noticing what a nice smile she had ."
"the way it framed her heart shaped face made her appear much less like jade than he had originally thought ."
"`` thank you ."
"maybe we 'll end up together . ''"
"she licked her lips before adding , `` you know , at the same hospital . ''"
"`` i would like that ."
"but i 'm afraid that wellstar pales in comparison to grady . ''"
"`` surely the suburbs offer some interesting cases ? ''"
"`` they do ."
"i 've been there since my residency , so i ca n't imagine working anywhere else ."
"after all , i would n't be standing here today with you if it were n't for wellstar and your grandfather . ''"
"`` that 's true . ''"
"tilting her head , she gave him a very alluring smile ."
"`` and what a pity that would be if our paths had n't crossed . ''"
"he sucked in a breath at the directness of her statement ."
"could she really be interested in him ?"
"sure , it was common knowledge that aidan and others wanted them to get together , but he had imagined that she had not known their intentions ."
"and while originally he had been turned off by aidan 's suggestion of fixing them up , he could n't help but be intrigued now ."
"there was something so refreshingly different about megan , despite her physical similarities to jade ."
"`` mommy ! ''"
"a small voice cried ."
"pesh glanced over megan 's shoulder where a fair-haired toddler came bounding over ."
"he wrapped his arms around megan 's thigh ."
"she gave him an apologetic look before bending over ."
"`` what 's the matter , sweetie ? ''"
"he grinned up at her ."
"`` miss you . ''"
"with a smile , she bent over and picked him up ."
"when he sat on her hip , she turned her attention back to pesh ."
"`` this is my son , mason . ''"
"pesh could n't help noticing how megan searched his face to see if there was any judgment or even disgust at her having a son ."
"he felt neither of those emotions ."
"he had to admit he was a little surprised ."
"aidan had failed to mention that fact as well ."
"not to mention , she seemed young to be a mother , considering she was just finishing her clinicals ."
"`` it 's nice to meet you , mason . ''"
"`` can you tell pesh hi ? ''"
"megan urged ."
"`` hi , esh , '' mason said , with a grin ."
"pesh could n't help laughing , and he was thankful that megan giggled as well ."
"`` how old are you ? ''"
"mason held up two fingers to which megan shook her head ."
"`` he 's seventeen months . ''"
"pesh smiled ."
"`` you must be very proud of him . ''"
"`` i am . ''"
"she snuggled mason against her chest ."
"`` he 's the sweetest and best boy i could ever hope for . ''"
"`` you 're very blessed . ''"
"`` thank you . ''"
"they were interrupted by aidan 's sister , angie , who pesh had met earlier ."
"`` looks like it 's time to start ."
"come on mason ."
"mommy has to go be noah 's godmother now . ''"
"mason reluctantly went to his grandmother ."
"`` be good for grammy , '' megan instructed ."
"after angie walked off with mason , the other family members began filing out of the room ."
"pesh turned to megan and gave her a sheepish smile ."
"`` i must admit that even though i attended a class with emma , i 'm a little unsure of what i 'm supposed to do . ''"
"`` it 's okay ."
"just follow my lead , and you 'll be fine . ''"
"`` thank you . ''"
"once it was only the two of them and aidan and emma in the room , aidan motioned for them ."
"a priest in decorated golden robes appeared at the door with a gleaming crucifix in his hands ."
"pesh tried not to feel intimidated as the odd man out in the situation ."
"music struck up on the organ , and the priest motioned for them to follow ."
"before they went out the door , emma glanced down at noah ."
"`` please , please , do not scream in there and act like a demon baby ."
"be the angel i know you can be . ''"
"he acknowledged her request by sticking his tongue out and flailing his fists ."
"aidan chuckled at emma 's plea ."
"`` relax , babe ."
"if he feels you getting all tense , he 's going to get fussy . ''"
"emma sighed ."
"`` he 's already fussy ."
"he was fine until i put him in the gown . ''"
"`` i guess he feels that wearing a dress is insulting to his manhood , '' aidan reasoned with a smile ."
"when emma shot aidan a death glare , megan and pesh could n't help laughing at the two of them ."
"aidan winked at emma before starting out the door ."
"at megan 's side , pesh walked up the aisle ."
"when they reached the baptismal font , the music ended , and the priest began speaking ."
"he informed the crowd of what was about to take place and the significance of all the religious rites noah was about to receive ."
"aidan and emma made the sign of the cross on noah 's forehead before megan leaned in to do the same ."
"when megan elbowed him , pesh reached over to clumsily follow their lead ."
"after he finished , he glanced at megan ."
"she smiled and mouthed , `` good job . ''"
"he returned her smile ."
"he followed through the rest of the proceedings as aidan and emma pledged to raise noah in the faith ."
"then it came time for him and megan to agree to stand by noah as godparents ."
"the priest took a fussing noah from emma 's arms ."
"when the first trickles of water hit the base of noah 's head , he cooed and kicked his arms and legs ."
"emma appeared relieved at how noah was n't behaving like a possessed baby as she had feared ."
"`` thank god he loves his baths , '' aidan muttered beside pesh ."
"once the baptism part was finished , the priest made a final talk , and then it was over ."
"just as pesh sighed with relief and was looking forward to making a quick exit , aidan grabbed his arm ."
"`` do n't go anywhere ."
"we have to do pictures . ''"
"inwardly , he groaned ."
"he wanted , no he needed , a moment alone to process his thoughts ."
"everything had been so overwhelming-being outside his usual world , meeting all of aidan 's family , and then having the prospect of megan thrown in as well ."
"awkwardly , he stood around as a photographer came forward and proceeded to take several pictures of aidan , emma , and noah ."
"then it was just aidan and noah or emma and noah ."
"`` okay , i need the godparents now . ''"
"pesh smoothed down his tie and allowed the photographer to pose him in the group shot ."
"after they finished with the four of them , noah was handed to megan for pictures with just the godparents ."
"as the photographer pushed megan closer against pesh 's chest , he glanced down at her ."
"her reassuring smile caused his heartbeat to accelerate ."
"for the first time , he noticed the sweet aroma of her hair as the long , blonde strands brushed against him ."
"he could also make out the alluring scent of her perfume ."
"he liked the feel of her against him a little too much ."
"it made him want to draw her into his embrace ... maybe do other things that he should n't be thinking when he was in a church ."
"glancing over her shoulder at him , she joked , `` jeez , you 're like a giant standing next to me . ''"
"`` am i ? ''"
"he had n't noticed the differences in their heights-he 'd been focusing on her too much ."
"she laughed ."
"`` just a little bit ."
"of course , it does n't take much for someone to make me look short . ''"
"`` you look perfect to me , '' he said sincerely ."
"craning her neck back to look at him , she gave him a teasing grin ."
"`` do i ?"
"are you flirting with me , dr ."
"nadeen ? ''"
"he stared down at his feet , trying to avoid the heat of her stare ."
"he tried to hide the red flush he felt entering his cheeks ."
"`` okay , now just with the godmother , '' the photographer ordered ."
"reluctantly , pesh stepped away from megan ."
"as the flashes went off , snapping hers and noah 's picture , he kept his gaze on her ."
"as she focused on the camera , megan 's blue eyes sparkled as she stretched her face into a wide grin ."
"noah 's tiny fingers wrapped around some of the strands of her hair , causing megan to yelp in pain ."
"`` easy now ."
"i got ta keep that , '' she said to noah ."
"`` okay , that should get it , '' the photographer said ."
"`` here godfather , it 's your turn , '' megan said , as she handed noah to him ."
"by now , noah was tired of being held and tired of being ensconced in yards of lace ."
"he peered up at pesh before howling ."
"`` i 'm sorry , little guy , '' he cooed , trying to bounce noah in his arms ."
"as noah continued to cry , pesh looked apologetically at the photographer ."
"just before he was ready to give up , megan came up and started clapping her hands and making noises at noah ."
"the baby instantly stopped crying ."
"`` that 's right , noah ."
"give me a smile , '' megan urged , as she backed up to stand by the photographer ."
"she continued making the noises , and she even resorted to flashing one of the strands of her hair at him ."
"finally , noah 's quivering lips broke into a grin ."
"`` there we go , '' the photographer said ."
"pesh quickly plastered a smile on his face ."
"after several flashes went off , the photographer put down his camera ."
"`` got it . ''"
"both noah and pesh sighed in relief ."
"gazing down at him , pesh asked , `` bet you 're ready to get home and get out of that dress , huh ? ''"
"`` it 's a gown , not a dress , '' megan countered with a smile ."
"he laughed ."
"`` regardless of what it 's called , i do n't think he likes it very much . ''"
"megan brought some of the lace between her fingers ."
"`` probably a little itchy for him . ''"
"`` did your son wear this gown ? ''"
"`` no , this is aidan 's gown ."
"mason wore my mother 's , which my brothers and i also wore . ''"
"`` i see . ''"
"`` in your culture do they do anything special like this for a baby ? ''"
"pesh nodded ."
"`` we have the namakaran , or naming ceremony ."
"it 's sometimes held in a temple ."
"and like this , it 's all about offering blessings to the child-family and friends coming together in support of the new baby . ''"
"`` i like it . ''"
"they were momentarily interrupted by aidan and emma walking up ."
"noah immediately reached out for emma ."
"`` such a mama 's boy , '' aidan muttered , which earned him a glare from emma ."
"he merely winked at her in response before starting down the aisle ."
"pesh saw megan 's mother beckoning her with a wave ."
"`` guess you need to go , '' he said ."
"`` but i 'll see you at aidan and emma 's , right ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he swallowed hard ."
"`` um , yes , i 'll be there . ''"
"`` good , '' she replied , with an alluring smile ."
"she gave him a small wave before walking off to join her parents ."
"shaking his head , he mumbled , `` this is trouble . ''"
"chapter four when megan arrived with her parents at aidan and emma 's , she was surprised to see a catering truck outside in the driveway ."
"her surprise continued once she got inside the house ."
"gazing out into the backyard , she saw where tables were set up alongside the pool ."
"the tables were adorned with blue and white tablecloths and glittering blue and white centerpieces ."
"a low whistle behind her got megan 's attention ."
"turning around , she saw casey shaking her head ."
"`` wow , this is one epic baptism party , '' she remarked ."
"`` it 's impressive ."
"that 's for sure , '' megan agreed ."
"as emma breezed into the kitchen with noah in a more comfortable outfit , casey cocked her head ."
"`` so , i was just wondering where the ice sculptures were ? ''"
"pink tinged emma 's cheeks ."
"`` i kinda got carried away ."
"with me not working anymore , the old marketing and pr side of me let loose ."
"and with my connections , i was able to get everything ridiculously discounted . ''"
"megan smiled ."
"`` everything looks wonderful ."
"you waited so long to have a baby that it makes sense you might go a little overboard . ''"
"emma wrinkled her nose ."
"`` i never wanted to be one of those moms who threw the over-the-top parties . ''"
"while casey started to open her mouth , megan smacked her playfully ."
"`` it 's just catered in food , right ? ''"
"emma nodded ."
"`` they did the tables , too . ''"
"`` then i think you 're safe from being a momzilla party monster ... for now . ''"
"casey laughed ."
"`` i 'll anxiously be awaiting noah 's first birthday party . ''"
"with a scowl , emma mumbled , `` whatever . ''"
"realizing she did n't see mason , megan quickly excused herself and went outside ."
"she did n't like the idea of him being close to the pool ."
"even with everyone around , it was still too dangerous for her liking ."
"just as her chest started to tighten , she saw him on her papa 's lap ."
"the two of them sat at one of the tables underneath the shade of a massive umbrella ."
"several of her other younger cousins sat around them , playing on their psps and other hand-held devices ."
"`` everything okay ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` we 're fine , honey , '' papa replied ."
"`` let me know if he gets to be too much . ''"
"cocking his head , papa demanded , `` are you trying to say i 'm old or something ? ''"
"`` no , not at all ."
"he 's a handful even for me . ''"
"he waved her away with a hand gnarled with age and time ."
"`` go on and enjoy yourself ."
"i 'll keep an eye on mason . ''"
"she smiled and leaned down to kiss his weathered cheek ."
"`` thanks , papa . ''"
"he returned her smile ."
"`` you know , while you 're enjoying yourself , you might go spend a little time with the godfather . ''"
"megan 's eyes widened ."
"was he trying to set her up with pesh like he had with emma ?"
"he gave her a knowing look ."
"`` be good for both of you . ''"
"`` um , okay ."
"whatever , papa , '' she murmured , before she turned away ."
"although she hated to admit it , she had been looking forward to talking to pesh again ."
"she had tried to kid herself that she had n't secretly been searching the crowd for him when she was taking in all of emma 's decorations ."
"when she did finally catch sight of him , her traitorous heart skipped a beat ."
"she did n't mind if her body gave a reaction , but it pissed her off that her heart was affected by him as well ."
"he 'd ditched his suit jacket along with his tie ."
"with the first button of his shirt undone , she could see a tuft of dark chest hair ."
"she bit her lip at the sight ."
"she was a sucker for chest hair ."
"her eyes dipped down to take in how the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to his elbows , giving just a glimpse of his defined biceps ."
"casey had been absolutely right-he was built like a brick shithouse ."
"megan wanted nothing more than to get better acquainted with his body , especially with fewer clothes on him ."
"at the sound of emma 's voice behind her , she jumped ."
"`` ready to eat ? ''"
"emma asked ."
"`` um , sure . ''"
"emma gave her a puzzled look before nodding in pesh 's direction ."
"`` why do n't you ask pesh to join you at aidan 's and my table ?"
"he does n't know a lot of people , and i would hate to have him end up with the kids . ''"
"megan quirked her brows in surprise ."
"`` are you sure ? ''"
"`` why would n't i be ? ''"
"with a shrug , megan replied , `` i do n't know ."
"maybe because you did n't like the idea of me getting to know him . ''"
"emma shook her head ."
"`` i never said i did n't want you two to get to know each other-i said i did n't want you using him for a fling . ''"
"megan could n't help rolling her eyes ."
"`` the day is n't over yet ."
"i could still turn on my powers of seduction and lure pesh into a night of seedy passion . ''"
"emma stared at her in shock before busting out laughing ."
"`` seedy passion ?"
"those words and pesh will never , ever go together in the same sentence . ''"
"`` are you saying that you and aidan have never had seedy passion ? ''"
"`` aidan and pesh are not in the same league of men ."
"i love aidan , but he 's not necessarily a gentleman ."
"pesh is . ''"
"`` yeah , but you 're a lady , '' megan protested ."
"`` maybe in the street , but she 's one hell of a freak in the bedroom , '' aidan said behind them ."
"emma squealed before whirling around to smack him ."
"`` people could hear you , '' she admonished ."
"as aidan chuckled , megan shook her head ."
"`` forget other people ."
"me having to hear it was painful enough . ''"
"crossing his arms over his chest , aidan said , `` i came over here to ask if we were going to eat or not ?"
"people are getting restless ."
"i had no idea i was going to interrupt such an interesting conversation ."
"of course , i do n't think i want to know why the two of you are discussing emma 's and my sex life right now . ''"
"emma waved her hand dismissively ."
"`` we were n't ."
"and yes , we 're ready to eat ."
"let 's round everyone up . ''"
"as emma walked off to call people to sit down , aidan grinned at megan before saying , `` total freak . ''"
"megan closed her eyes as if in pain ."
"`` spare me ."
"please . ''"
"`` just saying ."
"because you never know if your gentleman might be a super freak too . ''"
"and with a wink , he walked off to join emma , leaving megan to wonder why everyone seemed so concerned with hers and pesh 's love lives ."
"as the sunlight started fading , most of the party guests began to trickle out the door ."
"by the time it was dark , it was only a few of aidan and emma 's close friends left ."
"megan had let her parents take a sleepy mason home , vowing she wanted to stay to help emma clean up ."
"the truth was she wanted to spend as much time as she could with pesh ."
"thankfully , she found herself sitting next to him at one of the poolside tables ."
"somehow they managed to end up by themselves after some of the other guests had left ."
"leaning forward in her chair , she asked , `` did you always want to be a doctor ? ''"
"pesh nodded ."
"`` for my fifth birthday , my father bypassed the usual play doctor 's kits by giving me a real medical bag with tools from the hospital ."
"i examined everyone who would stand still long enough , including the two dogs . ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` i bet you were a cute little doctor . ''"
"`` my mother has some embarrassing pictures , '' he replied , with a smile ."
"`` so your father was also a doctor ? ''"
"`` yes , he had a general medicine practice for forty years ."
"he just recently retired . ''"
"`` did he pressure you to follow in his footsteps ? ''"
"he grinned ."
"`` i 'm starting to feel like i 'm being interrogated . ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` i 'm sorry if you feel that way ."
"i 'm just trying to get to know you . ''"
"`` you 're certainly a very attractive interrogator , '' he said ."
"`` i think you 're avoiding the question by flattering me . ''"
"`` there 's flattery and then there 's the truth . ''"
"cocking her brows , she replied , `` and then there 's not answering my question . ''"
"he held up his hands in defeat ."
"`` fine , fine ."
"no , i did n't feel pressure to become a doctor ."
"my father would have never wanted me to pursue a profession where i did n't feel useful . ''"
"megan smiled ."
"`` so you 've always had a need to help people ? ''"
"`` pretty much ."
"as the oldest , i always looked out for my two younger brothers and sister ."
"my mother has always called me an old soul . ''"
"`` i can see that about you . ''"
"leaning forward , he rested his elbows on the table ."
"`` now it is my turn to be the interrogator . ''"
"`` okay , i do n't mind . ''"
"`` what about you ?"
"did you always see nursing in your future ? ''"
"`` yes and no ."
"originally , i wanted to be a doctor . ''"
"his brows shot up in surprise ."
"`` really ? ''"
"when she nodded , he asked , `` what happened ? ''"
"there was no way she was going to tell him the truth about her past and why she had been forced to abandon medical school ."
"instead , she shrugged ."
"`` life happened , i guess ."
"i decided on the next best thing , which was nursing . ''"
"pesh stared thoughtfully at her ."
"`` was it your son ? ''"
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"`` was it your son who changed your plans about medical school ? ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` no , it was before i had mason . ''"
"`` does he ... are you ... ? ''"
"pesh shook his head ."
"`` forgive me ."
"i was being too forward . ''"
"`` no , go ahead ."
"i told you i was n't afraid to answer your questions . ''"
"he grimaced ."
"`` but it 's rude to pry , and it 's not my business . ''"
"`` just ask your question , '' she replied ."
"after a resigned sigh , he finally asked , `` were you married ? ''"
"`` no , i 'm not divorced ."
"and no , mason 's father does n't have anything to do with him . ''"
"anger flashed in pesh 's dark eyes ."
"`` even though i know nothing of him , i know that he is not a man ."
"a man does not abandon his children and his responsibilities . ''"
"`` you would be right ."
"he 's just a boy playing at being a man , '' she replied , glancing down at the table ."
"when pesh took her hand in his , she jerked her head up in surprise ."
"in a soft voice that vibrated with empathy , he asked , `` he hurt you very much , did n't he ? ''"
"as she shifted in her chair , she tried downplaying the moment by wagging her free finger at pesh ."
"`` now you 're really turning the heated questions on me , are n't you ? ''"
"he quickly released her hand ."
"`` i apologize . ''"
"she sighed ."
"`` no , it 's okay . ''"
"she raked her fingers through her hair as she tried processing if she was really going to be honest with pesh ."
"gazing into his eyes , she did n't detect any judgment or prying-there was only compassion ."
"`` yes , he hurt me ."
"he continues to hurt me each time i look at mason and realize what he 's being denied . ''"
"she jerked her chin over to where aidan cradled a sleeping noah in his arms ."
"as the others talked and laughed around him , aidan stared down at his son with such love in his eyes and adoration on his face that it cut a jagged hole in megan 's chest ."
"her chin trembled as she replied , `` i want that for my son . ''"
"pesh 's dark eyes pooled with empathy as he once again took her hand in his ."
"`` it is n't the same pain , but i do know how you feel ."
"i experience it every time i see a husband and wife sharing a loving moment ."
"it drives home what i do not have ... what i have lost . ''"
"megan wiped her eyes with the back of her hand ."
"`` emma told me about your wife ."
"i 'm very sorry . ''"
"`` thank you , '' he murmured ."
"nibbling her bottom lip , megan then hesitantly asked , `` what was she like ? ''"
"by his raised eyebrows , pesh seemed surprised by her question ."
"megan hoped she had n't stepped over a boundary in asking ."
"he leaned back in his chair and drew in an agonized breath ."
"`` she was my world-the sun , the moon , and the stars . ''"
"he met her intense gaze , checking to see if she really wanted him to continue ."
"after she gave a brief nod , he began to talk ."
"he told her how they had met and all the little attributes that jade possessed that made her special ."
"as megan listened to him speak with such reverence and love about his late wife , she could n't help feeling just a little bit jealous ."
"she 'd never had a man possess such intense feelings for her ."
"she could n't imagine ever being loved so completely by a man that not even death could lessen his feelings ."
"`` what you had with jade , what you still feel for her , it 's really beautiful , '' she murmured when he finished ."
"pesh jerked a hand through his thick hair ."
"`` it 's interesting to hear you say that ."
"i think most women are turned off by what they perceive is a man who ca n't let go of his dead wife . ''"
"megan shook her head ."
"`` i do n't think so ."
"who would n't be turned on by a man who feels so deeply that he did n't stop loving his wife just because she died ? ''"
"pesh 's eyes widened at her statement , and he sucked in a harsh breath ."
"`` most women do n't want to share your heart , '' he challenged softly ."
"`` then they 're obviously insecure ."
"all of us have the ability to love people in infinite capacities ."
"i love my son with all my heart and soul , but there will still be room for a man ... someday . ''"
"he stared at her for a moment , unblinking and unmoving ."
"`` i have to say that i find your reasoning absolutely fascinating . ''"
"`` you do ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"the intensity of his gaze caused her to laugh nervously ."
"`` i do n't think a man has ever called me fascinating . ''"
"`` that 's a pity . ''"
"before she could try changing the subject , aidan came by their table with noah in his arms ."
"`` after i put him down , i 'm going to make some drinks ."
"emma wants one of her margaritas ."
"you game ? ''"
"he asked megan ."
"she nodded ."
"a drink would certainly help cool her off after the conversation she 'd been having with pesh ."
"`` sure ."
"i do n't think i 've had one in forever . ''"
"`` neither has she ."
"i may be peeling her off the ceiling tonight , '' he teased ."
"megan laughed ."
"`` you have seriously got to stop with the innuendo ."
"you are my uncle , and it is mortifying and disgusting to have to think of you in that capacity . ''"
"`` i am so terribly sorry for scaring your sensitive mind . ''"
"grinning , aidan turned to pesh ."
"`` beer okay with you , or would you like something fruity , too ? ''"
"`` i 'm fine with a beer , '' pesh replied ."
"aidan bobbed his head ."
"`` be right back . ''"
"after aidan headed in the house , pesh caught her staring at him ."
"`` what ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` just surprised you wanted a beer , that 's all . ''"
"`` and why is that ? ''"
"she shrugged ."
"`` you just seemed a little too refined for beer . ''"
"he tilted his head at her ."
"`` what other preconceived notions do you have about me ? ''"
"`` none really , '' she lied ."
"in her mind , she could n't help thinking how she wanted to make him be dirty just for her ."
"she wondered what other surprises he might have up his sleeve ."
"`` for some reason , i do n't believe that . ''"
"he crossed his arms over his broad chest ."
"`` let me guess ."
"you think that i 'm a 'refined ' man who drinks wine , would never think of cussing or have inappropriate thoughts , organizes his underwear drawer , and who considers doing the crossword puzzle a fun friday night ? ''"
"megan could n't help snorting at his summation ."
"it was a good distraction not to focus on how he had mentioned inappropriate thoughts and his underwear drawer ."
"at the moment , she was having inappropriate thoughts about his underwear ... or hopefully lack thereof ."
"of course , she could n't help judging him as not being the commando type ."
"`` no , that 's not what i think of you . ''"
"`` i would hope not ."
"i know that since i 'm a little older than you- '' `` just a little ? ''"
"the corners of his lips turned up ."
"`` obviously you think i 'm an old man . ''"
"`` no , i do n't , '' she blurted ."
"`` how old do you think i am ?"
"just shy of adult diapers and a walker ? ''"
"she scowled at him ."
"`` i was not insinuating that at all ."
"i think you 're probably close to ankle 's age . ''"
"pesh 's brows furrowed in confusion ."
"`` ankle ? ''"
"she laughed before explaining where the nickname came from ."
"`` i see ."
"so just how old is ankle again ? ''"
"`` thirty-four . ''"
"`` hmm , '' pesh murmured ."
"`` are you younger than that ? ''"
"`` older actually ."
"i 'm thirty-seven . ''"
"damn , he was a lot older than her ."
"twelve years to be exact ."
"`` did i shock you ? ''"
"he asked , with a teasing lilt in his voice ."
"she shook her head ."
"`` i 'd hardly call thirty-seven old . ''"
"`` it 's considerably older than you are , right ? ''"
"`` i suppose , '' she lied ."
"he grinned at her as he leaned on the table with his elbows ."
"`` and just how old are you ? ''"
"`` twenty-five-i 'll be twenty-six in a few months . ''"
"`` twenty-five going on twenty-six . ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"`` i must be positively ancient to you . ''"
"he held out his hand and examined it ."
"`` i might have a liver spot or two . ''"
"she smacked his hand playfully ."
"`` shut up ."
"thirty-seven is not old . ''"
"`` see any grey hairs ? ''"
"he asked , bending over to where his delicious head of hair was in front of her face ."
"her fingers itched to run through the dark strands ."
"her mind ran straight to an illicit image of her fingers tugging on his hair as he went down on her , jerking too hard when he sucked and licked her until she came , and then stroking the damp hair back from his forehead as he rose up to cover her body with his ."
"she cleared her throat that had run dry ."
"`` no , of course not . ''"
"he jerked his head up to wink at her ."
"`` then there 's hope for me yet . ''"
"`` i would think so . ''"
"aidan appeared then , carrying all the drinks on a tray ."
"`` i expect a tip when you guys finish , '' he teased ."
"`` i 'll remember that , '' megan replied ."
"after jerking his chin toward the table next to him , aidan said , `` why do n't you guys come over here with us ? ''"
"she fought the urge to slap him ."
"she was enjoying having pesh to herself ."
"`` um , sure ."
"okay , '' she said , reluctantly rising out of her chair ."
"when they changed tables , she was glad to see pesh take the empty chair beside her , rather than across from her ."
"once she got settled in , she was n't lamenting her seat change too much ."
"between casey , and emma 's other best friend , connor , the table was kept in raucous laughter ."
"it was good being with a group of friends ."
"after she had gotten pregnant , she did n't have much in common with her sorority sisters anymore ."
"then when she became a mom , she rarely saw anyone from her old group ."
"her life moved in an entirely different orbit than theirs now ."
"the conversation and laughter flowed as easily as the drinks ."
"megan found herself halfway through her second margarita when she started feeling funny ."
"a flush filled her cheeks at the same time she felt clammy ."
"as aidan came back with another beer , she asked , `` did you put something different in this one ? ''"
"`` yeah , we ran out of the tequila i got for the party , so i gave my favorite niece a good dose of sierra silver . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"megan demanded ."
"aidan 's brows furrowed behind his tipped back beer bottle ."
"once he swallowed , he asked , `` does it taste bad ? ''"
"megan pinched her eyes shut ."
"the room was beginning to spin around her a little ."
"as she brought her hand to her forehead , she heard a smack across the room and aidan cry , `` ow , dammit , em ! ''"
"`` that tequila is a hundred and fifty proof alcohol , aidan , '' emma chastised ."
"`` sorry ."
"i did n't realize it ."
"i just thought it was the better stuff because it was white tequila ."
"that 's your drink of choice , not mine . ''"
"oh god , she was in so much trouble ."
"she 'd barely consumed any alcohol since she got pregnant and had mason ."
"now she 'd had one regular dosed margarita and almost a full one of straight alcohol ."
"a gentle hand landed on her thigh ."
"`` are you all right ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"she opened her eyes to see two blurry images of him staring at her with concern ."
"`` not exactly . ''"
"`` would you like me to take you home ? ''"
"`` yes , please ."
"while i can still walk . ''"
"as she rose out of her chair , she swayed a little in her heels ."
"after taking two steps , aidan 's apologetic face appeared before her ."
"`` i 'm sorry , meggie . ''"
"`` it 's not your fault ."
"and i 'll be fine . ''"
"she wagged a finger at him ."
"`` but when i get shit for coming home drunk , i 'm so telling mom it was your fault . ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` i 'll gladly take the blame and fear angie 's wrath . ''"
"he leaned in to hug her ."
"`` thanks for today-you know , for being noah 's godmother . ''"
"`` you 're welcome ."
"thanks for me asking you . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` i mean , thanks for asking me . ''"
"god , this was bad ."
"after exchanging hugs with emma and reassuring her at least twenty times that she would be fine and that she did need to go home , pesh led megan out the front door ."
"he slid a strong arm around her waist to steady her as they went down the porch steps ."
"as she staggered to the car , she moaned ."
"`` i ca n't go home yet ."
"not like this . ''"
"she stared up into his face ."
"`` i ca n't let mason see me like this . ''"
"he pushed a strand of hair out of her face ."
"`` do n't worry ."
"i 'll take you to my house then . ''"
"`` just so i can sober up ? ''"
"she questioned , although she really did n't mean it ."
"she wanted to go to his house for a lot more , especially after being so close to his fabulously built body ."
"`` yes , of course ."
"i 'll make you some strong , black coffee . ''"
"`` thank you , '' she murmured , trying to still the spinning of her head ."
"`` you 're welcome . ''"
"always the gentleman , pesh opened the door for her , and she collapsed onto the seat ."
"once he made sure she was comfortable , he closed the door and went around the front of the car ."
"megan gazed around at the plush interior of the jaguar with its leather seats and sleek console ."
"after pesh slid into his seat , he put the key in the ignition and cranked up ."
"as they started backing out of the driveway , she glanced over at him ."
"`` do you have to come to the rescue women of drunken . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` i mean , drunken women a lot ? ''"
"she asked ."
"wait , was she slurring ?"
"he cut his eyes over at her and smiled ."
"he seemed to be trying really hard not to laugh at her ."
"`` not exactly ."
"but i 'm always happy to help a damsel in distress . ''"
"megan giggled ."
"oh god , now she was giggling ?"
"she never giggled ."
"she eyed pesh suspiciously ."
"`` got a hero complex , huh ?"
"wan na be every woman 's knight in shining armor ? ''"
"`` not every woman 's , '' he murmured ."
"`` mmm , pesh , you wan na be my knight in shining armor ? ''"
"as soon as the words left her lips , she fought the urge to slap her hand over her mouth ."
"alcohol always had this effect on her-it left her completely without a sensor ."
"pesh 's jaw clenched , and he did n't reply ."
"pitching her upper body over the armrest , she got as close to him as she could ."
"`` you did n't answer my question . ''"
"taking his eyes momentarily off the road , he pinned her with an intense gaze ."
"`` i 'd be anything and everything you wanted me to be , if you would give me the chance . ''"
"momentarily dumbfounded , she could only stare at him ."
"`` oh wow , '' she replied , as she collapsed back onto the seat ."
"the motion caused her to feel dizzy ."
"mumbling almost incoherently , she said , `` mmm , hot as f**k and anything i want ."
"lucky me . ''"
"`` i have a feeling you would n't have asked the original question if you were n't intoxicated . ''"
"with a snort , she replied , `` drunk or sober that woulda been a helluva line to hear from a man . ''"
"`` i 'm glad you think so . ''"
"after spending a few moments in tense silence , megan leaned forward to flick on the radio ."
"`` do you mind ? ''"
"`` go ahead . ''"
"humming along with one of the songs , she laid her head back on the seat ."
"`` i wo n't hurt your ears by singing . ''"
"`` do you not sing ? ''"
"`` oh , i sing , but i do n't do it well ."
"emma 's the one with the voice . ''"
"`` so i 've heard . ''"
"turning to look at him , megan asked , `` did she ever sing for you ? ''"
"`` sadly , no . ''"
"megan harrumphed as she crossed her arms over her chest ."
"`` she made out with you , but she would n't sing for you ?"
"that 's just rude . ''"
"pesh made a strangled noise ."
"`` emma told you ... about us ? ''"
"`` mmm , hmm . ''"
"she grinned at him ."
"`` i hear you 're a great kisser . ''"
"cutting his eyes over to her , he gave her a pained look ."
"`` it really was n't like that for us ."
"i mean , we were n't in love with each other . ''"
"`` yeah , that 's what she said ."
"course , she did admit that you got her all hot and bothered . ''"
"`` s-she did ? ''"
"he stammered , embarrassment coloring his cheeks ."
"`` hey , the ability to get a woman hot is nothing to be ashamed of ."
"hell , i got turned on when i first saw you today ."
"like my panties got wet . ''"
"`` megan , do n't , '' pesh warned , gripping the steering wheel to where his knuckles turned white ."
"turning in her seat , she eyed him before licking her lips ."
"`` you do n't want me to say how you got me hot in a church ?"
"how you still get me hot acting all bashful about the sex talk ? ''"
"`` please ."
"just do n't . ''"
"`` fine , '' she muttered , before flouncing back in her seat ."
"she did n't speak to him for a long time ."
"instead , she closed her eyes and laid back with her head cushioned on the head rest ."
"when the car started to slow , she snapped her eyes open ."
"she did n't know if she fell asleep or passed out ."
"sitting up , she peered out the window at the posh houses of the subdivision they were in ."
"as they pulled into the driveway , megan could n't help staring up at the house ."
"`` holy shit , this place is beautiful . ''"
"pesh chuckled ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"`` i know you think it 's just the alcohol talking , but i 'm serious ."
"you have great taste . ''"
"`` i hope you 'll like the inside just as much . ''"
"`` i 'm sure i will . ''"
"after he came around to open the door , she hopped out of the car a little too fast ."
"her wobbly legs wavered , and she ended up crashing into pesh 's chest ."
"staring up at him , she gave an apologetic smile ."
"`` sorry about that . ''"
"`` it 's fine ."
"need some help ? ''"
"with the alcohol fueling her libido , she replied , `` if it means having your hands on me , then sure . ''"
"pesh grimaced , but his arm still came around her waist to steady her ."
"she loped along beside him ."
"after he unlocked the door and punched in the alarm code , she followed him inside ."
"her blurry vision took in the expansive kitchen with his gleaming stainless steel appliances ."
"she followed him as he made his way into the living room ."
"motioning toward the couch , he said , `` why do n't you have a seat while i fix you some coffee ? ''"
"while it was a nice idea to sober herself up , she did n't want any coffee ."
"she just wanted pesh ."
"grabbing the lapels of his suit coat , she pulled herself flush against him ."
"`` when did you put this back on ? ''"
"she wondered aloud ."
"she felt so tiny against his massive chest ."
"it was a good feeling though-one of safety and protection ."
"it also lit her even more on fire with lust ."
"cocking her head , she glanced up at him to survey his expression ."
"even in the semi-darkness , she could see his dark eyes burning with desire ."
"she ran her hands up his chest to his neck ."
"she tugged him down to where his face was inches from hers ."
"fortified with liquid courage , she brought her lips to his ."
"she could n't help the little moan that came from deep in her throat ."
"pesh 's mouth was warm , soft , and inviting ."
"the brief connection made her want him all the more-for him to devour her ."
"tentatively , she slid her tongue across his bottom lip , beckoning him to open for her ."
"almost instantaneously , the warmth of his tongue met hers ."
"they slid against each other , tasting , searching , and seeking ."
"he gripped her face in his hands , holding her captive as his tongue plunged in and out of her mouth ."
"emma had been right-the man could kiss like there was no tomorrow ."
"he knew when to be gentle with his mouth and then when to switch to more demanding , almost conquering kisses ."
"if he could practically make her soak her panties with just a kiss , what the hell could he do with his dick ?"
"as she started to feel lightheaded and weak on her legs , they stumbled over to the couch before pesh collapsed back , taking her with him ."
"straddling his lap , she gazed at him momentarily before his mouth attacked hers again ."
"as his tongue once again invaded her mouth , she began to raise her h*ps and grind against him ."
"groaning , he broke the kiss by throwing his head back ."
"he gulped in long breaths of air like he was a dying man deprived of his last breath ."
"she felt the same way ."
"she kissed a trail over his chin and down his neck ."
"`` pesh , i want you , '' she murmured into his skin ."
"his chest heaved up and down with her declaration as if he was finding it hard to breathe ."
"she broke away to stare into his eyes ."
"`` please . ''"
"chapter five pesh could n't believe the delicious nightmare he found himself trapped in ."
"a beautiful , sexy blonde writhed against him ."
"the hem of megan 's dress had ridden up to her hips , and a tiny scrap of lace underwear was the only thing covering her core as she rubbed herself against his crotch ."
"her heat and her arousal scorched through the fabric of his pants to singe the skin of his growing erection ."
"he wanted nothing more than to flip her on her back , tear away the underwear , and plunge himself deep inside her ."
"it had been so , so long since he had been within the tight walls of a woman ."
"while his conscious railed against him for even entertaining the thought , his body was onboard ."
"`` please , '' megan whimpered , as she continued to rise and fall over his erection ."
"`` we ca n't ... we should n't . ''"
"she ran her hands up his chest before wrapping them around his neck ."
"`` but i could make you feel good . ''"
"`` i 'm sure you could . ''"
"`` and i know you could make me feel good , too ."
"i 'm already drenched just kissing you . ''"
"her fingers raked through his hair , tugging desperately on the strands ."
"`` i need this , and you need this . ''"
"his body was completely onboard with how much he needed her ."
"if she pressed any closer to him , she was going to set him off and make him do something he had n't since he was a teenager , which was come in his pants ."
"but his once hazy mind was starting to refocus and overpower the desire pumping through his body ."
"he could not and would not take her when she was drunk ."
"it was completely against his character ."
"he 'd never taken advantage of a woman , and he never would ."
"he gazed into her hooded eyes ."
"`` but it would be so very wrong . ''"
"her lip trembled ."
"`` do n't you want me ? ''"
"`` yes , without a doubt . ''"
"`` then why wo n't you have sex with me ? ''"
"`` because you 're inebriated . ''"
"she rolled her eyes in a huff ."
"`` you 're sooo proper , are n't you ?"
"a proper gentleman . ''"
"he cupped her face in his hands ."
"`` if not taking advantage of you in your state of intoxication makes me a gentleman , then i suppose i am ."
"what kind of man would i be to take you now only to have you wake up with regret and remorse ? ''"
"`` the kind of man who wants to get laid ! ''"
"her hand dipped between them to grasp his erection , causing him to hiss ."
"`` i feel you against me-i know you want this as much as i do . ''"
"although the devil on his shoulder raged at him , he quickly removed megan 's hand ."
"`` believe me when i say i wo n't have sex with you like this ."
"i would never disrespect you so much as to not make love to you like you deserve . ''"
"she blinked a few times as if she was having a hard time processing his words ."
"`` regardless of what you have going on in that head of yours , you are better than this ."
"you deserve a man who will take his time with you and show you what pleasure through making love really is . ''"
"`` i 've never had that , '' she whispered regretfully ."
"he gave her a sad smile ."
"`` i did n't think you had . ''"
"he brushed the hair out of her face and cupped her cheek ."
"`` if i take you , i 'll be making love to you ."
"i 'll have you begging and pleading , but you 'll be coming so many times you 'll lose count ."
"you 'll understand the difference between a quick tumble and the all-consuming power of a physical connection fueled by an emotional one . ''"
"she rapidly blinked her blue eyes in disbelief while her cheeks flushed ."
"`` oh god , did you actually just say that ? ''"
"`` i did . ''"
"he gave her a teasing smile ."
"`` and you 'll be calling out my name more than his . ''"
"`` i ... '' she began before she quickly clamped her lips shut ."
"her eyes widened before she scrambled off of his lap ."
"before he could question her on what she was doing , she threw up all over the front of her dress ."
"when she wavered on her feet like she was going to collapse , pesh tumbled off the couch , reaching out for her ."
"grabbing both of her shoulders , he steadied her ."
"she glanced down at her dress before gazing back at him ."
"pesh 's heart ached at the sight of tears pooling in her eyes ."
"`` are you all right ? ''"
"her chin trembled before big , fat tears slid down her cheeks ."
"`` oh god , '' she whispered ."
"`` please do n't cry . ''"
"`` t-this is s-so embarrassing , '' she hiccupped ."
"`` it 's okay ."
"you do n't have to be embarrassed . ''"
"moaning , she covered her face with her hands ."
"`` first , i made a fool out of myself coming on to you and now i 've puked in front of you like some sorority girl who ca n't handle her liquor . ''"
"`` stop beating yourself up ."
"come , let 's get you cleaned up . ''"
"he slid an arm around her waist to steady her on their way down the hall to the bedroom ."
"she continued to weep softly as they made their way into the bathroom ."
"using his free hand , he flicked on the light ."
"`` can you stand in the shower ? ''"
"with a weak nod , she replied , `` i think so . ''"
"`` if not , there 's a ledge you can sit on ."
"let me turn on the water for you , and i 'll get you a towel . ''"
"he propped her up against the counter before striding over to the shower ."
"once he felt the water was a good enough temperature , he then went over to the closet ."
"he pulled out a towel before returning to megan who had her head in her hands ."
"with his free hand , he took one of her hands and pulled it away from her face ."
"`` please stop beating yourself up ."
"i hate to see you so upset . ''"
"`` i ca n't help it ."
"i 'm such a fool . ''"
"`` no , if you 're a fool , then so am i ."
"we both wanted each other . ''"
"`` but i got drunk ... i never get drunk anymore . ''"
"`` it was an accident ."
"things like that happen . ''"
"he cupped her chin and forced her to look at him ."
"`` you are none of the negative things your mind is calling you right now . ''"
"`` really ? ''"
"her broken expression , coupled with her need for his reassurance , nearly crushed him ."
"he had to fight from taking her in his arms ."
"he knew if he did that , he would end up doing something he should n't with her ."
"finally , he nodded ."
"`` but you do smell , so go on and get in the shower . ''"
"the corners of her lips curved up in a half smile ."
"`` do you have something i can change into ?"
"and maybe a toothbrush ? ''"
"he nodded ."
"`` one second . ''"
"leaving her in the bathroom , he went back into the bedroom to his closet ."
"he took out a pair of scrubs he knew would be too big and too long for her and then coupled it with an emory university t-shirt ."
"when he got back to the bathroom , megan was struggling with the zipper at the back of her dress ."
"with a defeated expression , she dropped her hands ."
"`` could you please help me ? ''"
"`` of course . ''"
"he sat the clothes down on the counter ."
"he then reached up to tug down the zipper ."
"the back of the dress gaped open , exposing her cream colored skin and navy blue lace bra and panties ."
"he closed his eyes to try and block out the glaring images rocketing through his mind ."
"his lips on her skin , his tongue licking up her spine , his hands curving around her ribcage to cup her br**sts ."
"he forced himself to step back ."
"clearing his throat , he replied , `` done . ''"
"glancing at him over her shoulder , megan gave him a weak smile ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"he took out a spare toothbrush from underneath the counter and placed it next to the clothes he 'd brought her ."
"`` let me know if you need anything else . ''"
"`` okay . ''"
"whirling around , he strode out of the bathroom ."
"not wanting to go too far in case megan needed him , he began pacing around the bedroom ."
"he momentarily faltered when he heard the shower turn off ."
"he waited for her to appear , but she did n't ."
"just as he was about to knock on the door , the whirring hum of the hairdryer started ."
"he continued his pacing as she dried her hair ."
"next , he heard the sink water turn on as she brushed her teeth ."
"when it was quiet once again in the bathroom , his feet froze as he stared anxiously at the bathroom door ."
"when it opened , pesh 's breath caught ."
"appearing fresh-faced and clean , megan looked so beautiful as she tentatively stepped into the bedroom ."
"`` everything okay ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she jumped at his voice ."
"`` um , it 's fine ."
"thank you again for the clothes and for letting me shower . ''"
"`` you 're more than welcome ."
"and there 's no need to thank me . ''"
"chewing on her lip , she glanced from the bed to him ."
"`` i texted my mother to tell her i was staying the night at emma 's . ''"
"before he could say anything , she quickly added , `` thank you for putting my purse in the bathroom ."
"that was very thoughtful of you . ''"
"`` you 're welcome , '' he replied ."
"then he thought of her text ."
"`` so you 're staying at aidan and emma 's ? ''"
"after all , the last thing he needed was to have her here-a reminder of what he could n't have ."
"it would be enough to drive any man crazy ."
"megan shook her head ."
"`` do you mind if i stayed here instead ? ''"
"when he started to open his mouth , she shook her head ."
"`` i promise no funny business ."
"i just do n't want to go home yet ."
"if you do n't want to me to stay , you can take me to emma 's . ''"
"`` of course you can stay . ''"
"`` i can sleep on the couch or in the guest room . ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` you 'll sleep right here . ''"
"he walked over to his massive king-sized bed ."
"he turned down the covers before glancing back at her ."
"`` come on ."
"getting some rest will make you feel better . ''"
"she eyed him hesitantly ."
"`` i really ca n't take your bed ."
"that would be imposing . ''"
"`` i do n't mind ."
"i promise . ''"
"`` only if you 're sure ? ''"
"`` i 'm sure . ''"
"tentatively , she started walking over to him , her eyes never leaving his ."
"she eased down onto the mattress before sliding beneath the sheets ."
"when she appeared comfortable , he covered her up ."
"as he started to go , she reached out to grab his arm ."
"`` no , please do n't go ."
"do n't leave me alone . ''"
"his brows shot up in surprise ."
"`` you want me to stay with you ? ''"
"`` yes , please . ''"
"`` in this bed ... with you ? ''"
"when she nodded , he exhaled a ragged breath ."
"`` megan , i do n't think that 's a good idea . ''"
"`` do n't overthink it ; just stay with me . ''"
"although his brain was raging war at him to make the sane and responsible decision , he replied , `` give me a few minutes . ''"
"`` okay , '' she replied softly ."
"turning , he strode into the bathroom ."
"he did n't bother glancing in the mirror because he was pretty sure he would n't like what he saw ."
"instead , he stripped off his suit and tie ."
"although he probably should have thrown on more clothes , he left his boxers on and grabbed a white shirt off the hamper ."
"after pulling it over his head , he went back out into the bedroom ."
"megan lay on her side in the bed , her face turned toward the bathroom ."
"her eyes were closed , but they popped open the moment he entered the bedroom ."
"without a word to her , he walked around the other side of the bed and climbed inside ."
"lying on his back , he propped one arm over his head ."
"his other hand rested on his chest ."
"he twisted his fingers into the fabric of his shirt over his heart ."
"somehow he wanted to still the erratic beating ."
"just when he thought he might be comfortable , megan turned over to face him ."
"`` you 're so far away , '' she whispered ."
"`` i thought it was for the best . ''"
"the corners of her mouth momentarily turned down in a pout ."
"then she inched closer to him ."
"he sucked in a breath and tried not to hiss when he felt her head nuzzle against his chest ."
"before he could stop her , she had thrown an arm around him ."
"thankfully , she did n't try anything else ."
"and within a few minutes , her labored breathing signaled she had fallen asleep ."
"pesh stared up at the ceiling and willed himself to be able to go to sleep as easily ."
"surprisingly , as megan 's soft snores echoed against his side , his eyes grew heavy ."
"for the first time in two years , he fell asleep with someone in his arms ."
"chapter six sunlight streamed across megan 's face , causing her to squint her eyes tighter closed against the bright invasion ."
"she was warm and comfortable , and she did n't want to wake up ."
"but the tranquility of her morning was shattered when a soft snore came from behind her ."
"it was far too deep to be one of mason 's ."
"panic prickled its way up her skin ."
"where am i ?"
"her eyes frantically scanned the room ."
"overcome by both masculine decor and smells , she realized she was in a man 's bedroom , or more importantly a man 's bed ."
"she had n't woken up this dazed and confused since she got hammered for the first time ."
"she could n't even remember what day it was ."
"this was bad ."
"very , very bad ."
"she had to get out of there and get home to mason ."
"what kind of mother was she to wake up in a strange man 's bed ?"
"as she tried to roll over , she found herself entrapped by a strong arm wrapped around her waist ."
"her gaze flicked down to the tan , muscled arm ."
"who the hell did that belong to ?"
"a whimper escaped her lips ."
"oh god , had she actually slept with a man she had no memory of ?"
"never in her life had she made such a mistake as that ."
"nausea overcame her , and she knew she needed to get out of bed and into the bathroom ."
"she shoved herself so hard away from the person that she ended up elbowing him in the ribs ."
"he groaned ."
"`` oh , i 'm sorry ."
"i did n't mean to hurt you , '' she quickly apologized ."
"`` it 's okay , megan , '' he murmured drowsily ."
"that voice ."
"it took only a second for her to register who she was in bed with ."
"and with that realization , everything from the night before came crashing down on her ."
"she had accidentally gotten drunk off her ass , pesh had taken her to his house to sober up , and then ... oh god , she had come on to him like a brazen floozy ."
"she buried her head in her hands and moaned ."
"`` hey , how do you feel this morning ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` like i 've been run over by a truck . ''"
"`` want me to fix you a good hangover cure ? ''"
"she peeked at him through her fingers ."
"`` you actually know a hangover cure ? ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` you think someone like me has never been drunk ? ''"
"when she bobbed her head , he laughed ."
"`` i 'm sorry to disappoint you , but there have been many , many times i 've woken up just as you are now . ''"
"`` that 's hard to imagine . ''"
"she gazed down at the scrubs and t-shirt she was in ."
"although she doubted it , she could n't help but ask ."
"`` did we ... '' `` no , we did n't . ''"
"she arched her brows in surprise ."
"`` if we did n't sleep together , then why did you ... i mean , why are you in bed with me ? ''"
"`` because you begged me to stay . ''"
"she gasped in horror ."
"was n't it enough that she had thrown herself so wantonly at him , but now she 'd begged him to stay with her ?"
"`` i did ? ''"
"he nodded ."
"`` you said you did n't want to be alone . ''"
"vaguely she remembered pleading with him to lie close to her ."
"what a nightmare ."
"`` i 'm so sorry . ''"
"`` do n't apologize . ''"
"when she started to protest , he held up a hand ."
"`` i have to admit it was nice being in bed with someone again-feeling their warmth , the softness of their body as they lay beside you . ''"
"he swallowed hard ."
"`` i 've missed that more than i knew . ''"
"overcome with the emotions threatening to overtake her , megan did n't know what to say ."
"all she knew is she needed to get out of there ."
"`` i need to get home ... or to emma 's ."
"i ca n't let my parents think i stayed out all night with a man i just met . ''"
"`` i understand ."
"i would n't dream of compromising your reputation . ''"
"she stared at him for a moment ."
"sometimes the way he spoke made it seem like he was from a different world or time period ."
"`` i , uh , i need to use the bathroom . ''"
"`` go ahead . ''"
"tumbling out of the covers , she then streaked across the room ."
"once she closed the door behind her , she exhaled the breath she 'd been holding ."
"she made it to the toilet just in time to throw up again ."
"she wondered after doing the same thing the night before how there was anything left in her stomach to empty ."
"once she finished , she leaned over the sink , pooling water in her hand before bringing it to her mouth ."
"after gargling to rid herself of the nasty taste , she eventually dug under the counter for some mouthwash , and then brushed her teeth ."
"without a hairbrush or comb , she did her best to tame her out-of-control hair ."
"once she surmised that she looked presentable enough to face the firing squad , aka aidan and emma , she left the bathroom ."
"pesh had thrown on some clothes and stood in the middle of the room ."
"he raised his brows expectantly at her ."
"`` i 'm ready to go now . ''"
"`` of course . ''"
"when she started for the bedroom door , she abruptly stopped ."
"`` wait , my dress ? ''"
"`` i 'll send it out to be dry cleaned . ''"
"`` oh , '' she murmured ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"in silence , they made their way through the house ."
"megan tried not to be so obvious as she took in the high ceilings of the living room , the floor to ceiling windows that overlooked a large , spacious yard ."
"pesh had an amazing house-one that was far too big for just him ."
"it certainly was made for a family-the one he sadly did n't have ."
"as he started to open the door leading out to the garage for her , pesh stopped and turned around ."
"staring intently at her , he said , `` i 'd like to see you again . ''"
"megan could n't help the shocked gasp that escaped her lips ."
"she 'd made a repeated fool out of herself the night before , and he still wanted to see her ?"
"`` you ca n't be serious . ''"
"`` i am . ''"
"she gave a slight jerk of her head ."
"`` i do n't think that is a good idea . ''"
"`` but why ? ''"
"he countered sincerely ."
"with a contemptuous snort , she replied , `` is n't it obvious ? ''"
"`` if you 're alluding to the fact you accidentally got drunk last night and then became ill , that has little relevance to me ."
"accidents happen , and i 'm man enough to realize that . ''"
"he closed the gap between them ."
"`` i liked being with you yesterday . ''"
"remembering what emma had said , megan could n't help asking , `` you want to date me , do n't you ? ''"
"`` yes of course ."
"what else would i want to do ? ''"
"when she replied , `` have sex , '' a flush entered his cheeks ."
"`` that is not what i meant . ''"
"`` and that 's a pity . ''"
"his brows furrowed ."
"`` whatever do you mean ? ''"
"`` you and i ... we want different things ."
"you want to date and get married again , right ? ''"
"`` yes , that is something i desire very much . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` but i do n't want to be in a serious relationship right now with you or anyone for that matter ."
"i 'm certainly not ready to get married anytime soon ."
"i just wanted to have some fun with someone . ''"
"pesh frowned ."
"`` i do n't think i understand . ''"
"`` what i want from you is the same thing i wanted last night ."
"just sex , '' she answered honestly ."
"`` you do n't want to date me ... you only want to have sex with me ? ''"
"if the situation had n't been so dire , megan might 've laughed at the horrified expression on pesh 's face ."
"he appeared absolutely floored that she could ever think of only using him as a sex toy ."
"finally , when she gathered herself together , she shook her head ."
"`` i 'm sorry , but that 's the way i feel . ''"
"she braced herself for some sort of wrath out of him or even a lecture ."
"what he did was even more surprising ."
"he gave her a sad smile ."
"`` and i 'm sorry you feel that way because i would have really enjoyed getting to know you better . ''"
"without another word , he opened the door ."
"always the gentleman , he waited for her to go through first ."
"tucking her head to her chest , she bypassed him to walk to the car ."
"once again , he appeared to open the car door for her ."
"`` thank you , '' she murmured ."
"he nodded before walking around the front of the car ."
"without another word to her , pesh cranked up , and then began backing down the driveway ."
"the ride to aidan and emma 's was only twenty minutes , but it seemed to take an eternity ."
"the painful silence hung heavy around her ."
"pesh did n't look at her ."
"instead , he kept his gaze firmly on the road ahead of them ."
"when he pulled into aidan and emma 's driveway , megan felt her stomach clench ."
"she wished there was some way to make things right between them ."
"but she had a feeling she had gone too far and said too much ."
"as he put the car in park , he turned to look at her ."
"`` thank you for the ride , '' she said ."
"`` you 're welcome ."
"it was my pleasure . ''"
"`` most of all , i want to thank you for taking care of me last night ."
"you truly went above and beyond ."
"i can never thank you enough . ''"
"`` you do n't have to thank me ."
"i 'm glad i was able to help you . ''"
"nibbling on her bottom lip , she finally allowed herself to say what she was holding back on ."
"`` i wish things could be different , '' she said softly ."
"when she dared herself to look at him , she found him staring intently at her ."
"`` i 'm sorry , too ."
"take care of yourself ."
"okay ? ''"
"she bobbed her head ."
"`` the same to you . ''"
"with trembling hands , she fumbled for the door handle ."
"when she was finally able to open the door , she stumbled out onto the pavement ."
"as she made her way up the driveway , she could feel pesh 's eyes on her ."
"the car remained parked as she climbed the porch steps and rang the doorbell ."
"she hoped that noah was already up , and she was n't waking the household ."
"aidan threw open the door ."
"`` megan ?"
"what the hell ? ''"
"he asked ."
"his question and concern caused her to burst into tears ."
"`` why are you crying ? ''"
"aidan demanded ."
"`` it 's a long story . ''"
"he glanced from her out the door to pesh 's car ."
"his expression darkened ."
"`` did pesh hurt you ? ''"
"`` no !"
"of course not . ''"
"`` if he 's made you cry , i do n't care whether he 's noah 's godfather or not ."
"i 'll punch his lights out ! ''"
"she grabbed his arm ."
"`` stop it , ankle !"
"it 's not him , it 's me ."
"it 's all my fault ."
"okay ? ''"
"he stared at her in surprise ."
"`` what happened ? ''"
"`` give me some coffee and a chance to calm down , and then i 'll tell you everything . ''"
"although his expression was skeptical , aidan nodded , and then started to close the door ."
"megan stole one last glance of pesh as his car started reversing down the driveway ."
"she hoped for her sake and his it was the last time she would have to see him ."
"chapter seven megan nervously tapped her thumbs on the steering wheel of her car ."
"her clinical placement had come through , and she was now on her way to make her introductions to her preceptor , the nurse who would supervise her ."
"although she had initially been disappointed in not receiving grady , she was still excited to be doing the last part of the journey to becoming a nurse ."
"she was also grateful she had n't received the night shift that some of her fellow nursing students had ."
"she would have rarely been able to see mason if she had to sleep during the day and work at night ."
"she pulled into the parking lot of the wellstar er and eased into the first space she found ."
"after turning off the car , she grabbed her folder of paperwork along with her purse and headed inside ."
"she stopped at the front desk ."
"`` i 'm not a patient ."
"i 'm a clinical student here to see kristi parkman . ''"
"`` go on through , '' the receptionist said , before she buzzed open the authorized personnel only door ."
"breezing inside the heart of the er , megan could n't help feeling excited ."
"she could n't wait until she got her feet wet by working with patients ."
"glancing around , she was n't exactly sure how she was going to find the preceptor ."
"she stopped at an area teaming with nurses ."
"`` can i help you ? ''"
"one of them asked ."
"`` yes , i 'm here to see kristi parkman . ''"
"a tall blonde woman in her fifties came over to her with a beaming smile ."
"`` you must be ms ."
"mckenzie ? ''"
"`` i am . ''"
"`` it 's so nice to meet you . ''"
"megan smiled ."
"`` it 's nice meeting you , too . ''"
"`` we 're so very glad to have you ."
"i 've taken a look at your transcript , and it 's quite impressive . ''"
"`` thank you , '' megan replied ."
"`` why do n't i show you around today ?"
"that way you 'll be ready to go with the flow tomorrow . ''"
"`` sounds good . ''"
"with a smile , kristi led her around the maze of rooms ."
"she pointed out where the medicine room was , the trauma area , and where she would find the break room ."
"each time they passed a nurse or a doctor , kristi was quick to introduce megan ."
"`` everyone seems very friendly , '' megan mused ."
"`` it really is a great place to work ."
"now , i 'm not going to lie that some of the residents can be real ass**les ."
"but we 're so lucky to have a supervisor who is such a sweetheart . ''"
"`` that 's wonderful . ''"
"`` yes , everyone loves dr ."
"nadeen . ''"
"megan 's heartbeat slowed to a standstill ."
"nadeen ."
"no , it could n't be ."
"surely there were more doctors with that last name ."
"searching her mind , she tried desperately to remember where he said he worked ."
"`` oh good , he 's just down the hall ."
"let me introduce you two . ''"
"`` no , that 's really is n't necessary , '' megan protested feebly ."
"ignoring her , kristi called , `` dr. nadeen , come meet our newest nursing candidate . ''"
"the moment he turned around , megan felt like she was going to throw up ."
"after spending two months trying hard to forget about her infamous night with pesh nadeen , there he was right in front of her ."
"she could n't help having the classic line from casablanca flash in her head , `` out of all the gin joints in all the world , she had to walk into mine . ''"
"she certainly felt that way about all the hospitals she could have possibly been assigned to , she had to be assigned to his ."
"the shock and surprise registered on his face as well ."
"he was quick to mask it by smiling warmly at her ."
"`` hello again , megan . ''"
"kristi 's brows shot up at the familiarity of pesh 's greeting ."
"`` you know each other ? ''"
"`` um , well , '' megan began ."
"how was she going to explain ?"
"the last thing she needed was to get off on the wrong foot with her coworkers ."
"pesh nodded ."
"`` she and i share a godson . ''"
"`` oh how wonderful . ''"
"kristi patted megan 's back ."
"`` what luck for you then ending up here out of all the hospitals ? ''"
"`` yes , what luck , '' megan murmured ."
"kristi smiled ."
"`` well , i 'll let you two catch up for a minute or two . ''"
"`` no , that 's okay ."
"you do n't have to do that , '' megan protested ."
"waving her hand dismissively , kristi said , `` it gives me a chance to go grab a snack and something to drink ."
"be back in a few , and we 'll finish the tour . ''"
"megan fought the urge to run after kristi as she walked off ."
"instead , she turned back to pesh who was staring expectantly at her ."
"`` you do n't exactly look happy to see me , '' pesh said ."
"she shook her head wildly ."
"`` how could i be ?"
"the man , who i completely made an ass out of myself in front of , is at the hospital where i 'm doing my clinicals ."
"that does n't exactly make my day . ''"
"`` for the last time , you have nothing to be embarrassed about . ''"
"`` sorry , but that does not make me feel any better , '' she grumbled ."
"`` what can i do to put you at ease about working with me ? ''"
"rubbing her now aching head , she replied , `` i do n't know ."
"if i thought it would n't make me look bad , i 'd request a transfer . ''"
"`` i offend you that much ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"as she gazed up at him , his expression was wounded ."
"`` no , no , you do n't offend me ."
"it 's just that ... '' she chewed mercilessly on her bottom lip before she continued ."
"after taking a ragged breath , she replied , `` it 's just that for the past two years , i had pretty good control of my life ."
"the night i was with you , i let all that control crumble ."
"by getting drunk , i became someone else-someone i used to be ."
"the girl , or woman , who would do anything to get a man 's attention ."
"i do n't like that person very much , and i do n't ever want to go back there ."
"seeing you just makes me remember all of that . ''"
"megan could n't help being surprised by how honest she 'd been able to be with him ."
"pesh remained silent for a moment ."
"his dark eyes bore into hers ."
"`` i am sorry that you reflect so negatively on the night we were together ."
"for me , it was not marred by drinking or you getting sick ."
"i enjoyed spending time with you and getting to know you . ''"
"he swallowed hard ."
"`` i enjoyed waking up with you ."
"i would give anything for you to be able to look at me without having to feel bad about yourself . ''"
"`` you really enjoyed being with me that night ? ''"
"he nodded ."
"`` when i told you i wanted to see you again , i was serious . ''"
"she sighed ."
"`` that 's very sweet of you , but i have n't changed my mind about dating . ''"
"`` you have n't ? ''"
"with a shake of her head , she replied , `` i have too much going on in my life right now to get involved with someone ."
"it would n't be fair to them ... to you ."
"especially since we still want very different things from each other . ''"
"`` i see , '' he replied ."
"megan noticed the sadness that darkened his expression ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' she murmured ."
"`` you have nothing to regret ."
"any grief i 'm experiencing is once again my fault . ''"
"he gave her a rueful smile ."
"`` i seem to keep falling for women who are n't meant for me . ''"
"she sucked in a harsh breath at his words ."
"`` falling ?"
"you are ... you were falling for me ? ''"
"pesh opened his mouth to reply , but at the sound of kristi coming back from the break room , he shut it ."
"closing the gap between them , he whispered , `` do n't worry about working with me , megan ."
"we 'll always be friends , and i will respect your wishes and your distance . ''"
"for some reason , his words had the opposite effect they should have , and regret ricocheted through her ."
"finally , she managed to say , `` thank you ."
"i appreciate that . ''"
"with a smile , he then turned and walked away ."
"she heaved a painful breath as kristi walked up to her ."
"`` such a sweetheart , is n't he ? ''"
"`` yes , he is , '' megan murmured ."
"`` not bad on the eyes either . ''"
"a nervous giggle escaped megan 's lips ."
"`` no , he 's not . ''"
"`` i swear that half of the women here in the er act like they 're in heat whenever he comes around . ''"
"kristi fanned herself ."
"`` i mean , that body , those eyes , and those dimples ."
"lord , if i was n't a happily married woman , what i would n't want to do to that man ! ''"
"megan knew exactly what kristi meant ."
"unfortunately , she was never going to get the chance to experience it for herself ."
"somehow she 'd managed to find the only man left in the world who would n't partake in just a sexual relationship ."
"no , pesh had to want more than she was willing to give ."
"`` did you hear what i said ? ''"
"kristi asked ."
"megan snapped her gaze from pesh 's retreating form back to face kristi ."
"`` i 'm sorry what ? ''"
"kristi laughed ."
"`` oh no , i 'm about to lose another one to dr. nadeen 's charms , huh ? ''"
"shaking her head wildly , megan replied , `` no , no , we 're just friends-i do n't feel anything like that for him . ''"
"kristi winked ."
"`` yeah , just keep telling yourself that , honey . ''"
"chapter eight as pesh exited one of the exam rooms , he saw megan sitting on a stool at the counter , working on a chart ."
"when the door shut behind him , she jerked her head up and caught him staring ."
"he cleared his throat and walked over to her ."
"`` hello , '' he said , pleasantly ."
"`` hi . ''"
"`` so , are you settling in ? ''"
"she nodded ."
"`` everyone has been so nice and helpful . ''"
"`` good ."
"i 'm glad to hear that ."
"we usually have very good success rates with our clinical candidates . ''"
"megan smiled before her head dipped back down to work on the chart ."
"nervously , he scratched the back of his neck ."
"things were rolling along with them now that he knew he should n't try to rock the boat ."
"after all , he had promised her he would keep his distance ."
"but he could n't help himself ."
"in the two months since their first encounter , he had n't stopped thinking about her ."
"now that she had shown back up in his life so out of the blue , he could n't help feeling that it was fated ."
"ask her to dinner , his mind shouted ."
"he bit down on his lip to keep the question he was burning to ask from escaping his mouth ."
"finally , it rushed forth before he could stop himself ."
"`` why do n't you let me buy you dinner after work ? ''"
"megan 's scribbling pen stilled on the chart ."
"she glanced up and cocked her head at him ."
"`` dinner implies a date , and i thought we were clear on that . ''"
"he gave her a nervous smile ."
"`` well , i was only offering some less palatable cafeteria food ."
"i hardly think that constitutes a date . ''"
"`` in my realm of dating consciousness , any time you sit down at a table while eating and drinking together , it is a date . ''"
"crossing his arms over his chest , he countered , `` if that were true , it would mean you were dating your father and brother every time you sat down together ."
"i know your family is close , but i do n't believe they 're that close . ''"
"megan 's brows rose ."
"`` oh , is the good doctor cracking jokes now ? ''"
"`` perhaps . ''"
"the corners of megan 's lips turned up ."
"`` then what exactly would you consider a date ? ''"
"pesh leaned back against the wall , surmising her teasing smile ."
"`` a mutually agreed upon event . ''"
"`` you 're so proper , '' megan teased ."
"he rolled his eyes at her , something he rarely did until he began spending more and more time in her presence ."
"`` and you 're avoiding the initial question . ''"
"megan put down the pen and chart and crossed her arms over her chest ."
"`` so , if you could take me on a date , where would we go ? ''"
"pesh rubbed his jaw in thought ."
"`` well , if would have to be something you would want to do , but i would begin with dinner . ''"
"when she started to protest , he held up his hand ."
"`` somewhere that was romantic with candlelight and soft music-perhaps a place where we could dance in between courses . ''"
"staring at him in surprise , megan replied , `` you 're serious ? ''"
"`` of course . ''"
"she slowly shook her head back and forth ."
"`` okay , go on . ''"
"`` once we finished wine and dessert , i would then want to take you somewhere you 've never been- '' `` like your bedroom ? ''"
"megan interjected with a smirk ."
"`` i do believe you 've already been there before . ''"
"the teasing faded from megan 's expression , and a flush entered her cheeks ."
"`` may i continue ? ''"
"`` yeah , '' she murmured ."
"`` i would want to be with you to experience something you never have before-an art gallery , an opera , a musical ."
"anything that would bring wonderment and excitement to your face . ''"
"he gave her a small smile ."
"`` and it would mean all the more that i was getting to share it with you . ''"
"he watched with almost mild amusement as she processed his words ."
"most likely she had never had a man speak to her the way he was , and it was certainly affecting her ."
"feeling like it was time to go in for the kill , he asked once again , `` so , will you have dinner with me ? ''"
"pesh leaned forward expectantly as megan opened her mouth ."
"they were interrupted by the sound of emma 's voice ."
"`` oh thank god ."
"i 'm so glad you two are on . ''"
"her anxious tone was the only thing that could have torn pesh 's attention away from megan ."
"he glanced from emma to aidan , who was grimacing and rubbing his head ."
"`` what happened ? ''"
"emma replied , `` he fell and hit his head , '' at the same time aidan grunted , `` nothing . ''"
"megan stepped forward and went over to aidan ."
"she gasped as she surveyed him ."
"`` ankle , your pupils are huge ! ''"
"pesh took his penlight out of his coat pocket and went to aidan ."
"as he flashed the light into aidan 's eyes , he grimaced ."
"`` yeah , they are ."
"what exactly happened ? ''"
"he made sure to direct his question to emma since she appeared to be the only one being honest ."
"`` we were at my ob 's for our first ultrasound . ''"
"pesh 's eyes widened ."
"`` ultrasound ... you 're pregnant ? ''"
"`` again ? ''"
"megan questioned by his side ."
"the concern for aidan on emma 's face washed away and was replaced with a beaming smile ."
"`` yes , i 'm eight weeks . ''"
"`` why did n't you say something at dinner sunday ? ''"
"megan asked ."
"`` well , i only found out two weeks ago , and we wanted to wait to tell everyone until we had the first ultrasound . ''"
"megan 's blonde brows creased ."
"`` so what does the ultrasound have to do with ankle hitting his head ? ''"
"emma pursed her lips and cut her gaze over to aidan ."
"`` would you like to tell them ? ''"
"when he shook his head and then winced , emma sighed ."
"`` when they hooked me up to the fetal monitor , they thought they heard two heartbeats ."
"at the word 'twins ' , aidan passed out and hit his head on the counter and the floor . ''"
"while pesh quickly turned a laugh into a cough , megan was n't so tactful ."
"she burst out laughing ."
"`` you seriously passed out during the ultrasound ? ''"
"aidan scowled at her ."
"`` in my defense , it was n't quite the ultrasound yet . ''"
"at megan 's continued laughter , he shrugged ."
"`` it was pretty mind-blowing news . ''"
"`` oh ankle , honestly . ''"
"aidan turned to pesh ."
"`` so am i going to stand around all day getting shit , or are you going to examine me ? ''"
"pesh nodded ."
"`` of course ."
"your pupils are definitely a matter of concern . ''"
"glancing at emma , aidan said , `` just wait for me here . ''"
"`` okay . ''"
"pesh motioned for aidan to go into the first examining room ."
"as soon as the door closed behind him , aidan lunged for him , grabbing the lapels of his white coat ."
"`` i need a vasectomy ."
"today . ''"
"pesh fought the urge to laugh at the absurdity of the situation as well as aidan 's desperation ."
"`` okay , let 's get you to sit down ."
"you 've obviously been through a lot of trauma in the last hour . ''"
"aidan plopped onto the examining table ."
"he buried his head in his hands and groaned ."
"`` what a f**king nightmare of a day . ''"
"`` does your head hurt ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` a little . ''"
"`` any nausea ? ''"
"`` maybe . ''"
"pesh furrowed his brows ."
"`` what do you mean , maybe ? ''"
"aidan raised his head ."
"`` if you 're asking if i 'm nauseated now , the answer would be no ."
"i 'm not ."
"but on the other hand , if you 're asking if i get nauseous thinking about the fact that emma could have been pregnant with twins , and i would have had three kids under two and in diapers ... '' aidan shuddered ."
"`` then yeah , i get really f**king nauseous , and the room starts to spin a little . ''"
"easing down on his stool , he rolled over to aidan ."
"`` take a deep breath for me , okay ? ''"
"aidan 's chest expanded as he inhaled and exhaled ."
"`` again , '' pesh instructed ."
"after a few cleansing breaths , pesh cocked his head at aidan ."
"`` better ? ''"
"`` yeah , a little , '' aidan croaked ."
"he jerked his hand through his hair ."
"`` are you going to get me a referral for a vasectomy ? ''"
"pesh held up his hand ."
"`` i 'm confused ."
"if you know that emma is n't having twins , why do you want to have a vasectomy ? ''"
"`` because twins run on both sides of our families ."
"pop was a twin , and emma 's uncles are twins ."
"it 's like we have a genetic bull's-eye hovering over us ."
"we can barely be in the same room without conceiving , so it 's just inevitable that she 'll get pregnant again , and then i 'll have four kids ... maybe even five . ''"
"aidan swallowed hard as some of the color drained from his face ."
"`` i ca n't be a baby making machine . ''"
"`` actually , most recent studies still conclude that identical twins can happen to anyone , whereas , fraternal twins are the result of the mother producing two eggs in a single cycle ."
"this tendency to create multiple eggs is passed from mother to child ."
"given that emma does n't have a non-identical twin , you are fairly safe . ''"
"aidan tilted his head , his expression one of confusion ."
"`` so you 're saying i do n't have to worry about that ? ''"
"`` without knowing emma 's full genetic history , i could n't say , but it sounds like a no-at least for fraternal twins . ''"
"after processing pesh 's words , aidan shook his head ."
"`` like it really matters about the twins ."
"we 're still way too fertile together ."
"i need to stop this before it gets out of hand . ''"
"`` and what does emma think about all of this ? ''"
"a red flush entered aidan 's cheeks ."
"`` um , well , i have n't actually mentioned it to her . ''"
"`` you do n't think your wife needs to know about such a life-altering decision ? ''"
"`` well , of course i 'd tell her before i went in for the surgery . ''"
"as pesh crossed his arms over his chest , he could n't help wondering just how hard aidan had been hit in the head ."
"`` you can not seriously be sitting there saying that . ''"
"aidan stared at pesh for a moment before he groaned ."
"`` oh man , i 'm being a giant , selfish tool about this , are n't i ? ''"
"pesh smiled ."
"`` pretty much . ''"
"aidan rubbed his hand over his eyes ."
"`` it 's just ... being a father is f**king scary sometimes ."
"i worry about noah constantly , and now there 's another baby in the mix ."
"plus , another baby means more time taken away from emma . ''"
"he gave a weak smile ."
"`` i love her so much ."
"sometimes ... i just ca n't get enough of her , and i do n't want to share . ''"
"`` i think that 's a perfectly normal feeling . ''"
"aidan shook his head ."
"`` it makes me sound like a selfish bastard ."
"i mean , who is jealous of their kid for taking their wife 's time ? ''"
"`` a lot of men ."
"so stop beating yourself up over what you 're feeling ."
"most of all , do n't bottle it up ."
"talk to emma . ''"
"aidan 's blue eyes widened as he shook his head furiously back and forth ."
"`` oh hell no , i do n't want her thinking badly of me . ''"
"`` she wo n't ."
"emma always appreciates honesty . ''"
"`` about me being jealous of her time with our kids ?"
"i 'm pretty sure she would not want me being honest about that . ''"
"`` what has emma always said is the most important thing in a relationship ? ''"
"`` trust . ''"
"pesh nodded ."
"`` so how are you building her trust by lying to her about your feelings ? ''"
"aidan 's blonde brows furrowed ."
"`` so i should just tell her i 'm afraid of losing her and that i want us to maximize our time together ? ''"
"`` i would think so ."
"i do n't think any woman could get angry hearing her husband say how much he loves her and wants to be with her . ''"
"aidan appeared thoughtful ."
"`` i guess you 're right . ''"
"pesh smiled as he patted aidan 's shoulder reassuringly ."
"`` you 're doing a wonderful job being a father ."
"i 'm sure you 'll do just as well with a second and maybe even a third child . ''"
"at the mention of a third child , aidan swallowed hard , his adam 's apple bobbing up and down ."
"`` i do n't mind a third kid ... just not now ."
"maybe in a couple of years . ''"
"he glanced up and smiled at pesh ."
"`` but thanks for the vote of confidence on me being a father . ''"
"`` i just call it as i see it . ''"
"`` i appreciate that . ''"
"`` how about i check on your head now ? ''"
"aidan nodded ."
"`` okay . ''"
"pesh started feeling for unusual lumps and bumps on aidan 's head ."
"`` hmm , i do n't feel anything abnormal ."
"but just to be on the safe side , i want you to have a ct scan to rule out concussion or any brain bleeds . ''"
"`` jesus , i could have all of that from just hitting my head ? ''"
"`` you would be surprised ."
"let me go call in the order , and they 'll come take you back ."
"hopefully you wo n't have too long a wait ."
"we 're usually slower during the afternoons when the doctors ' offices and imaging centers are open . ''"
"as he started for the door , aidan stopped him ."
"`` hey , man , with all the craziness , i almost forgot to ask how is megan doing with her placement ? ''"
"pesh did n't have to think twice before responding , `` she is going to make an incredible nurse . ''"
"aidan grinned ."
"`` i 'm glad to hear it ."
"not that i ever doubted her abilities ."
"it 's just good to hear her praises sung by a doctor . ''"
"popping pesh on the chest teasingly with his hand , aidan asked , `` how 's it going between you and megan ? ''"
"pesh almost laughed out loud at aidan 's forthrightness ."
"it was not in his nature to be so blunt , and after megan turning him down yet again , he was n't really sure how to answer ."
"`` i truly respect and admire megan . ''"
"he considered that the most diplomatic way to answer her uncle 's enquiry ."
"despite feeling glad that he obviously had earned his friend 's respect , he would n't say anything untoward about megan in front of him ."
"it is her business who she did or did n't date ."
"`` that 's not what i meant . ''"
"`` i did n't imagine it was . ''"
"aidan eyed him before saying , `` look i know you got off to a rocky start , but it 's not hopeless ."
"are you planning on asking her out ? ''"
"`` you 're not letting this go , are you ? ''"
"`` nope ."
"not a chance . ''"
"pesh shoved his hands into his lab coat ."
"`` i have asked megan to accompany me on a date , but at this point , we are at a stalemate ."
"but , i am not planning on giving up anytime soon ."
"does that satisfy your inquisition ? ''"
"aidan laughed , but then his brows furrowed ."
"`` what do you mean ?"
"you two looked pretty cozy and comfortable together when we walked up . ''"
"with a regretful shake of his head , pesh replied , `` she does n't want to date me . ''"
"`` i call bullshit ."
"i may have been bonked in the head , but no one could deny the way she was looking at you ."
"maybe if you- '' although it was against his character , he let his anger override his better judgment ."
"`` she wants me for sex but not for a relationship , okay ? ''"
"aidan 's mouth gaped open ."
"`` you mean , she 's acting like ... a dude ? ''"
"`` if you mean that she has pretty much refused to go to dinner with me or any other honorable event that a man and woman can partake in on a date , and instead , she would rather pursue a strictly physical relationship , then the answer is yes . ''"
"`` my god , it 's like she 's turned into the old me , '' aidan muttered ."
"he ran his hand over his face before he looked at pesh again ."
"`` i 'm so sorry . ''"
"with a shrug , pesh replied , `` she 's still very young ."
"i suppose in her eyes , she 's been deprived of fun the last two years ."
"this is a way for her to make up for that ."
"regardless if we agree or understand it . ''"
"`` well , i still call bullshit on the whole thing . ''"
"he gave pesh a long , hard stare ."
"`` you have to keep trying , no matter what . ''"
"`` i did n't say i was giving up , did i ? ''"
"`` no , but i know from personal experience how hard it is to keep trying when it feels like you are n't winning . ''"
"`` what occurred with you and emma is totally different than with megan and me . ''"
"`` you still have to try . ''"
"aidan hopped off the examining table and wobbled for a moment on unsteady legs ."
"`` megan has been hurt before , and i do n't think she really knows what it is to be loved ."
"not deeply where her needs were considered ."
"hell , she was only twenty-three when she got knocked up ."
"i want her to find someone who will cherish her , man ."
"i want my girl cared for . ''"
"he patted pesh 's shoulder ."
"`` i think that someone could be you . ''"
"`` we 'll see . ''"
"when aidan started to argue , pesh shook his head ."
"`` time to see about your head . ''"
"`` whatever , '' aidan mumbled ."
"when pesh opened the door for aidan , emma and megan stared expectantly at them ."
"`` so what 's the verdict ? ''"
"megan asked ."
"`` i think he 's going to be just fine , but to be on the safe side , i 've ordered him a ct scan . ''"
"emma 's eyes widened in fear ."
"`` you think he has some brain injury from the fall ? ''"
"she asked in a panicky voice ."
"pesh smiled to try and put her at ease ."
"`` i do n't think there 's anything wrong besides a slight bump on the head , but i want to make sure there is nothing wrong with him . ''"
"`` okay then , '' emma replied ."
"an orderly appeared with a wheelchair to escort aidan to his scan ."
"before he sat down , aidan leaned over to kiss emma ."
"`` i 'm fine , babe ."
"stop worrying ."
"it is n't good for you or the baby . ''"
"she gave him a weak smile ."
"`` i 'll try hard not to . ''"
"he winked at her before collapsing down in the wheelchair ."
"`` nothing can keep me down-you should know that by now . ''"
"megan snorted ."
"`` at least we know the bump did n't do anything to your ego . ''"
"`` of course not , '' emma agreed ."
"kristi poked her head out of one of the examining rooms ."
"`` dr. nadeen , i need you . ''"
"he nodded before turning to megan ."
"`` why do n't you show emma to one of the family waiting rooms ? ''"
"`` sure , '' megan replied ."
"emma reached up to hug him ."
"`` thanks for taking care of aidan . ''"
"`` it was my pleasure . ''"
"he gave them a final wave before disappearing into the waiting patient 's room ."
"but after talking to aidan , he definitely had a little more determined bounce in his step ."
"chapter nine two days later when megan came in for a later shift , she found the emergency room in a state of chaos ."
"`` whoa , what happened ? ''"
"she asked kristi , after she 'd clocked in and put away her things ."
"kristi rolled her eyes ."
"`` every month or so we seem to have a day where everything is madness from start to finish ."
"you can never anticipate it-you kinda just have to go with the flow . ''"
"she grinned at megan ."
"`` so get ready to be on your toes today . ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` okay , sounds good . ''"
"as they started working their way through patients , things continued to escalate into overwhelming territory for megan ."
"kristi seemed to be experiencing the same feeling since the tops of her cheeks had a shine of perspiration beads on them ."
"the moment they finished with one patient and disinfected the room , another patient was waiting to enter it ."
"megan followed behind kristi as she went to poke her head in to the registration area ."
"`` hey janet , could you not call anyone else back ?"
"we 're getting swamped . ''"
"janet shook her head ."
"`` it 's just as crazy out in the waiting room ."
"like we 're almost overflowing . ''"
"kristi rolled her eyes ."
"`` fabulous ."
"it 's probably another full moon , which makes things absolutely insane . ''"
"she turned back to megan ."
"`` listen , since we 're so swamped , can you take the man in exam b ? ''"
"megan could n't help her eyes from widening ."
"`` really ?"
"on my own ? ''"
"kristi smiled before patting megan 's hand ."
"`` i 've seen you in action the last week ."
"i have faith in you . ''"
"`` okay , if you 're sure . ''"
"`` i 'm positive . ''"
"megan could n't contain her smile ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"taking her ipad , she flipped open the registration details on the patient awaiting her ."
"when she pushed open the door , she eyed the man on the examining table ."
"`` good evening mr. robertson , i 'm megan ."
"what- '' before she could even get out the standard `` what seems to be the problem ? ''"
"question , the man started shaking his head furiously ."
"`` no , no ."
"i wo n't let you examine me ."
"i want a doctor ."
"a male doctor ."
"you understand ? ''"
"`` sir , i understand , but i have to follow protocol , which is to ascertain your issues before the doctor comes in ."
"i see on the chart that you 're experiencing some abdominal swelling ? ''"
"he refused to meet her eye ."
"instead , he gazed over at the wall before holding up one finger to her ."
"`` i meant what i said ."
"i demand to see a male doctor . ''"
"`` yes , but we 're very backed up this afternoon ."
"i 'm not sure how long it will be before you are able to see a doctor , least of all a male doctor . ''"
"when it appeared the man 's resolve was fading a little , megan took a tentative step forward ."
"`` please , if you would just let me take a look at your abdomen . ''"
"`` it is n't my stomach , '' he mumbled ."
"`` then what is it ? ''"
"when he did n't respond , she sighed with frustration ."
"`` mr. robertson , you can not ignore abdominal swelling ."
"it can stem from many issues and have many repercussions . ''"
"he shifted uncomfortably on the table ."
"just when she thought she was making headway with him , he threw his head back and began screaming at the top of his lungs ."
"`` get me a male doctor ! ''"
"megan rolled her eyes ."
"the first time she had the chance to see a patient on her own , and he had to be a stark raving lunatic ."
"refusing to give into him or accept defeat , she stalked over to him ."
"she was going to exam his sexist ass if it was the last thing she did ."
"`` keep screaming , and i 'll call security , '' she warned before snatching the sheet off him ."
"his screams cut off to a shriek as he clawed for the sheet , but the damage was done ."
"she had seen more than enough ."
"`` oh ."
"my ."
"god , '' she murmured ."
"she gazed wide-eyed and open-mouthed at what had to be the poster child picture to go along with the warning labels on viagra and cialis for four-hour erections ."
"`` that 's going to have to be aspirated . ''"
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"she cocked her head at him ."
"`` the excessive blood in your penis ? ''"
"he nodded ."
"`` it 's not just going to go away on its own ."
"it has to be aspirated , which means drained out . ''"
"mr. robertson swallowed hard ."
"`` like with a needle ? ''"
"`` yes , with a very large needle . ''"
"when he started to protest , she brought her hand up ."
"`` lucky for you , i can not do the procedure-it is to be handled strictly by a doctor . ''"
"`` a male ? ''"
"`` if it came to your penis exploding from the pressure by waiting for a male doctor , would you seriously be that picky ? ''"
"his blue eyes widened in horror ."
"`` yeah , i thought so ."
"i 'll be back . ''"
"when she whirled out of the room , she ran right into the last person she wanted to have to deal with at the moment ."
"`` i 'm so sorry ."
"are you all right ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` i 'm fine . ''"
"he smiled down at her ."
"`` doing some patient evaluations on your own ?"
"that 's wonderful . ''"
"`` um , well , yes and no . ''"
"his brows knitted in concern ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"she could n't imagine telling pesh about mr. robertson 's condition ."
"the last thing she was going to do was refer the case to him ."
"draining an engorged penis should be left to the interns , not an attending physician ."
"`` oh , it 's nothing ."
"he 's just a little demanding . ''"
"at that moment , the door to the exam room flew open ."
"mr. robertson stood hunched over , his legs an almost painful distance apart ."
"he took one look at pesh and his white coat , and he lunged at him ."
"`` help me ."
"please ! ''"
"although it was strictly against the nursing code , she would have loved nothing more than to have throttled mr. robertson right then and there ."
"pesh grasped mr. robertson 's hands on his coat and pulled them down ."
"`` sir , you need to get back inside ."
"as unsteady as you are , you certainly do not need to be on your feet . ''"
"as pesh led mr. robertson back to the examining table , megan reluctantly followed them inside the room and closed the door ."
"`` what seems to be the problem ? ''"
"mr. robertson glanced from pesh to megan and then back to pesh ."
"with a sheepish expression , he replied ."
"`` um , i seem to be having some lower abdominal swelling . ''"
"megan had to fight from rolling her eyes ."
"she stepped between pesh and mr. robertson and looked pesh full on in the eye ."
"`` while the patient refuses to acknowledge his condition , it appears after examination that he has an extreme priapism . ''"
"at the word , color flooded into pesh 's tan cheeks , and he broke eye contact to momentarily stare down at the floor ."
"his reaction was exactly what megan had feared she would experience in the moment ."
"she had hardly imagined his level of professionalism would allow him to be embarrassed about a medical condition ."
"but of course , their past interactions made anything of the sexual kind a little more mortifying than if she was dealing with one of the male interns ."
"it took pesh only a few seconds to recover , and then he immediately turned his attention to mr. robertson ."
"`` did you take any erectile dysfunction medication in the last four to six hours ? ''"
"when mr. robertson started to look at megan , pesh shook his head ."
"`` my nurse will stay with me through the duration of your care ."
"so i will repeat once again , did you take any medication ? ''"
"`` cialis . ''"
"`` how many milligrams ? ''"
"when mr. robertson shrugged , pesh demanded , `` are you being purposefully evasive , or do you not know ? ''"
"`` i do n't know , okay ?"
"i got it off a buddy of mine . ''"
"`` do you normally take medication that is n't prescribed to you ? ''"
"`` i just wanted to try it out . ''"
"pesh glanced over at megan ."
"`` i 'm going to ask for a full blood work-up ."
"who knows what else he might 've taken . ''"
"megan nodded and punched in the code on the electronic chart to get a member of the phlebotomy team up to draw the blood ."
"after going over to the dispenser , pesh slid a pair of rubber gloves on ."
"`` i 'm going to have to examine you now . ''"
"with a resigned huff , mr. robertson threw the sheet back ."
"megan bit down on her lip to keep from laughing at the expression on pesh 's face ."
"she was pretty sure he had n't had to deal with a lot of penises that resembled enormous eggplants in his career ."
"of course , her amusement quickly faded when she realized how awkward it was being in the room with him while he held another man 's penis in his hand ."
"she tried busying herself with the electronic chart in front of her ."
"she wanted to do anything but look at the scene unfolding before her ."
"once pesh finished that part of the exam , mr. robertson eased back down on the examining table , and pesh once again eyed the eggplant-colored penis ."
"`` precisely how long have you had the erection ? ''"
"`` five and a half hours . ''"
"`` there does n't appear to be any artery rupture , so we wo n't need to perform surgery ."
"i think the quickest form of treatment , as well as the least invasive , would be to try an injection to narrow the veins and reduce the blood flow to your penis ."
"that should reduce the swelling . ''"
"mr. robertson 's eyes narrowed suspiciously ."
"`` and where do you have to give me the shot ? ''"
"`` in the penis , of course . ''"
"with a gulp , mr. robertson replied , `` fine ."
"do it . ''"
"pesh nodded ."
"`` can you grab a syringe of alpha-agonist please ? ''"
"`` sure , '' megan replied ."
"she gladly retreated from the room to head to the medicine closet ."
"after checking the syringe dosage , she reluctantly returned to mr. robertson 's room ."
"`` thank you , '' pesh said , as he took the medication from her ."
"she watched with mild disgust , as well as fascination , as he took mr. robertson 's penis in his hand ."
"`` take a deep breath , '' he instructed ."
"the moment the needle pricked the skin , mr. robertson howled uncontrollably ."
"megan could n't help rolling her eyes at what a complete pansy he was being about the pain ."
"once pesh finished , he dropped the empty syringe in the biohazard container and then glanced back at mr. robertson ."
"`` if the swelling has n't begun to dissipate in the next ten to fifteen minutes , we 're going to have to take another course of action . ''"
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"mr. robertson questioned , with a grimace ."
"`` aspirating the penis of the blood . ''"
"mr. robertson paled considerably ."
"`` oh god , she mentioned that . ''"
"he said the word she like megan was a swarm of locust ."
"pesh turned to smile at megan ."
"`` then she made a good call . ''"
"he then eyed his pager that was going off ."
"`` keep an eye on him ."
"i 'll be back in fifteen . ''"
"`` okay , i will . ''"
"time ticked by agonizingly slow as she worked on charts and kept an eye on mr. robertson ."
"every few minutes , he was lifting up the sheet to eye his erection ."
"each time he grimaced , megan imagined that the shot was n't working and the swelling had n't gone down ."
"when pesh entered the room again , he glanced from her to mr. robertson ."
"`` so how are we doing ? ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` no change . ''"
"`` i see . ''"
"he went over to a drawer and searched through it before producing a very large syringe with a very thick needle ."
"`` i 'm sorry , mr. robertson , but it looks like this is our only choice . ''"
"mr. robertson seemed speechless for the first time all night ."
"`` ms. mckenzie , can i get you to assist me ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` of course . ''"
"`` i need you to help restrain him ."
"i need him to be as still as possible . ''"
"megan fought the urge to roll her eyes at his suggestion ."
"mr. robertson had to outweigh her by a hundred pounds , not to mention that when pain got your adrenaline pumping , you were even stronger ."
"but she did as she was told ."
"as pesh brought the needle to mr. robertson 's penis , she gripped her hands tight into his shoulders ."
"when the needle pierced the skin , it took everything within her to keep him on the table ."
"gritting her teeth , she held her ground ."
"finally , when the last of the blood had been withdrawn , she was able to loosen her grip ."
"pesh tossed the syringe into the biohazard container and then turned around ."
"`` i advise you take some ibuprofen for both the pain and for the anti-inflammatory benefits ."
"i would also do a round or two of using an ice pack on your crotch ."
"it would be my strongest advice that you never take anymore erectile dysfunction medication until you actually need it . ''"
"`` whatever , '' mr. robertson croaked , collapsing back onto the table ."
"`` give him about thirty minutes , and then he needs to head on home ."
"we 'll need the exam room , '' pesh instructed ."
"`` okay , i will . ''"
"he gave her a quick smile before exiting the room ."
"after thirty minutes , she saw mr. robertson to the door of the er ."
"as he staggered into the waiting room , she shook her head ."
"`` megan , '' kristi called ."
"`` yes ? ''"
"`` go ahead and take your dinner break now . ''"
"`` are you sure ?"
"i mean , i can work through it since we 're so busy . ''"
"kristi shook her head ."
"`` we 're fine ."
"besides , you 're going to need all your strength ."
"things are probably going to get even crazier after the sun goes down . ''"
"megan tried not to appear horrified at the prospect ."
"instead , she ducked into the break room to grab her purse ."
"when she came out , pesh was waiting for her ."
"`` where are you going ? ''"
"`` oh , it 's my dinner break . ''"
"pesh gave an impish smile ."
"`` how fortunate ."
"it 's mine as well . ''"
"realizing what he was intending , she slowly shook her head back and forth ."
"`` no dates . ''"
"after crossing his arms over his chest , pesh asked , `` and how would it be a date if we happened to go to the cafeteria at the same time and sit at the same table ? ''"
"`` you 're pushing it , and you know it . ''"
"`` after what we both just endured , how can you deny me the pleasure of buying your dinner ? ''"
"a teasing twinkle flashed in his dark eyes-one she was n't used to seeing on him ."
"for some reason , she found it completely irresistible ."
"`` besides , how can i possibly have romance on my mind when i just held another man 's penis in my hands ? ''"
"her eyes widened in shock at his words ."
"`` d-did you actually just say that ? ''"
"`` yes , i believe i did . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` i ca n't believe you sometimes . ''"
"`` do n't try to pin me as one thing or the other ."
"just take me as i am , '' pesh suggested ."
"`` i 'll try . ''"
"as they started to the elevator , megan chewed her lip with unease ."
"turning to pesh she asked , `` what will people say if they see the two of us together ? ''"
"`` that we 're two single people having dinner , '' he replied ."
"`` you 're a physician , and i 'm a clinical student ."
"could n't i get in trouble ? ''"
"`` doctors and nurses often have dinner together on their breaks ."
"the cafeteria is a pretty inconspicuous place for us to be alone together ."
"if someone came upon us in one of the medicine rooms or an empty patient room , then we might have a problem . ''"
"`` if you say so , '' she mumbled , as he punched the down button on the elevator ."
"after they stepped on the car , pesh eyed her ."
"`` you really are worried , are n't you ? ''"
"she nodded ."
"`` my career means everything to me ."
"i do n't want to do anything to jeopardize it . ''"
"`` then i 'll make sure we do n't sit by ourselves . ''"
"`` thank you ."
"i really appreciate that . ''"
"as the car started its decent down , pesh threw his head back and exhaled a long breath ."
"`` well , that was ... '' megan grinned at him ."
"`` the good doctor seems speechless ."
"surely in all your years in the er , you 've seen crazier or more mortifying cases . ''"
"he cocked his head , appearing thoughtful ."
"`` a screwdriver lodged in a rectum is probably the tamest . ''"
"`` the tamest ? ''"
"megan questioned incredulously , as the elevator door dinged open ."
"pesh laughed ."
"`` a man high on meth walking into the er with his penis in his hand is probably the craziest . ''"
"megan 's hand swept over her mouth ."
"`` he actually cut off his ... '' she gazed around to make sure no one was listening to their conversation ."
"`` is the good nurse speechless ? ''"
"he teased ."
"she rolled her eyes at him ."
"`` so what happened ? ''"
"`` we got him sedated and into surgery as soon as we could ."
"i heard they were able to sew it back on ."
"i 'm not aware of whether or not it was ever ... fully functional again . ''"
"`` that is crazy . ''"
"`` i know . ''"
"pesh handed her a food tray ."
"as they surmised their choices , megan asked , `` was that your standard line of questioning in a situation like that ? ''"
"`` i think we 've established that i have n't been privy to many priapism cases , but yes , any time there is an issue with the penis that is not related to the urethra or bladder , you would ask those questions . ''"
"after the food service worker gave them both an odd look , pesh looked pointedly at her ."
"`` why do you ask ? ''"
"she shrugged ."
"`` just to be prepared for the next time . ''"
"he cocked his brows at her ."
"`` do you want to practice your line of questioning ?"
"you know , show me what you 've learned ? ''"
"`` let 's get our food first , shall we ? ''"
"`` okay . ''"
"after deciding that the grilled chicken salad was about the most appealing item in the food line , she grabbed a drink and some of the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies ."
"just as she inched up to pay , pesh put his tray next to hers ."
"he had chosen some kind of stir-fry that did n't look appetizing to megan ."
"when she dug in her purse for her wallet , he handed a twenty to the cashier ."
"as he took his change , she shot him a look ."
"`` what ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` you buying my dinner does n't look very innocent , '' she hissed , as they started toward the tables ."
"pesh shook his head with a smile ."
"`` i highly doubt she 's keeping the gossip mill going on how dr. nadeen bought the lovely new clinical student a salad . ''"
"`` you never know , '' megan countered ."
"trailing pesh , she watched as he made his way over to a table filled with doctors and nurses ."
"while the bottom half was filled with people , the top was practically empty ."
"`` mind if we take these seats ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` go right ahead , nadeen , '' a bushy haired doctor replied ."
"`` we 're expecting a few more to join us , '' he said , before covertly winking at megan ."
"`` you play a good game , '' she said , softly ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"she 'd just finished drizzling dressing over her salad when pesh said , `` ready to prove yourself ? ''"
"`` are we really going to talk about this while we eat ? ''"
"`` you 'll learn that most lunches and dinners are spent either reviewing cases or getting input on cases . ''"
"`` fine then . ''"
"putting on a professional air , she asked , `` have you taken any erectile dysfunction medication ? ''"
"after swallowing a bite of stir-fry , he replied , `` no , never . ''"
"`` do you have trouble obtaining an erection ? ''"
"the twinkle returned to his eyes ."
"`` i would think you would n't need to ask that question after our previous encounter . ''"
"a shiver went down her spine as she remembered her core rubbing against the hardened ridge in his pants ."
"`` considering it is unlikely that i would have any previous knowledge of the patient , just answer the question . ''"
"he gave her a sly smile ."
"`` no , never . ''"
"`` do you have trouble maintaining an erection ? ''"
"`` i could once again point out that you had personal knowledge of how well i was able to maintain myself once aroused , but i 'll refrain ."
"instead , i 'll say no . ''"
"`` ha , ha , nice way to get your point in . ''"
"`` i had to try . ''"
"she cocked her head at him , giving him a teasing smile ."
"`` if a patient was trying to flirt as much as you are during my questioning , then i would have to remind him that i am a professional . ''"
"`` i see ."
"then forgive me for trying to undermine your professionalism . ''"
"`` you 're forgiven ... for now . ''"
"he took a long swig of his iced tea ."
"`` you did really well back there . ''"
"`` really ? ''"
"`` yes , you did ."
"for that to be your first case on your own , you managed to keep yourself together and to give the patient the best level of diagnosis and care you could . ''"
"she could n't help the warmth rushing to her cheeks that his compliments caused ."
"`` thank you ."
"i appreciate your confidence . ''"
"`` i think you 're going to make an amazing nurse ."
"i know that there will be many hospitals vying to hire you . ''"
"megan shook her head ."
"`` i do n't know about that . ''"
"`` do n't underestimate your talents . ''"
"`` you think they would want to hire me here ? ''"
"she asked ."
"his brows rose in surprise ."
"`` you would n't mind a permanent placement here ? ''"
"she shrugged ."
"`` it has n't been long , but i have been happy here ."
"i like the people i work with ."
"i guess i would n't want to go into the unknown when i know what i have here . ''"
"he swallowed a bite of his rice ."
"`` that 's understandable . ''"
"after wiping his mouth , he smiled at her ."
"`` i think they would be crazy not to make you an offer . ''"
"`` i hope so . ''"
"leaning in over his plate , he held her gaze ."
"the intensity in which he stared at her caused her to shudder ."
"she did n't like the effect he was having on her in the middle of the hospital cafeteria ."
"a mixture of emotions coursed through her-warmth , safety , lust , happiness ."
"she had n't experienced that range of feelings with a man in a long , long time ."
"finally , he spoke ."
"`` i know it would make me very happy to have you here , and i would do everything within my power to ensure you stayed . ''"
"before she could reply , a tray smacked down onto the table next to her ."
"one of the residents , a young male named dr. morris , grinned at the two of them ."
"`` so , i hear you two just handled a priapism case . ''"
"`` yeah , we did , '' megan replied ."
"she did n't dare look back at pesh to gage his expression on being interrupted ."
"dr. morris groaned ."
"`` oh come on ."
"give me the juicy details ."
"i have n't gotten to see one of those yet ."
"the best groin swelling i 've had is when some idiot tried to pierce his balls , and they got infected . ''"
"when megan wrinkled her nose , pesh 's laughter surprised her ."
"her gaze flew to him , and he winked ."
"`` i told you that the conversations we had over dinner were not exactly appetizing . ''"
"`` i 'm starting to believe you , '' she replied , with a smile ."
"somehow she managed to devour the rest of her salad while pesh told dr. morris the ins and outs of the case ."
"after she finished , she rose out of her chair ."
"`` i guess i better head back ."
"you know , with everything being so crazy . ''"
"surprisingly , pesh did n't get up nor did he offer to walk her back ."
"instead , she saw an acceptance on his face that told her he was letting her go so there would be no suspicion raised about the two of them ."
"`` thank you for dinner , '' she said ."
"`` you 're welcome , '' he replied , with a smile ."
"his smiles were starting to do something to her that she did n't like ."
"they were no longer igniting her panties on fire ; instead , they were making her long to spend time with him ."
"she quickly slung her purse over her shoulder and strode out of the cafeteria ."
"with the chaos surrounding her , she thankfully put pesh out of her mind for the rest of the evening ."
"chapter ten after two exhausting weeks in her clinicals , megan was ready for a little randr ."
"so she was thrilled when emma called her asking if she wanted to join her for a girl 's day ."
"she was even more stoked when emma said that aidan was willing to keep mason , so he and noah could play together ."
"even though she was sure her parents would have watched him , she hated imposing on them so much ."
"an hour after the call , she was pulling into aidan and emma 's driveway ."
"when she opened the backseat to get mason out , he was already bopping up and down in his car seat with excitement ."
"he loved aidan and emma 's house , and he especially loved playing with noah , even though they were eleven months apart ."
"she grabbed him and his diaper bag and then made her way up the front walk ."
"emma answered the door with noah on her hip ."
"`` hey , i 'm so excited you could make it . ''"
"megan grinned ."
"`` you should know by now i have no life except for mason and work . ''"
"`` i feel the same way sometimes , '' emma replied , as megan stepped through the doorway ."
"as she walked through the foyer and down the hall to the kitchen , mason squirmed to get down ."
"once she set him on his feet , he ran into the living room ."
"that 's where aidan was lounging on the couch with beau on the floor next to him ."
"`` beau ! ''"
"mason cried ."
"he leaned in to hug the massive lab ."
"megan never had to worry about beau and mason ; he was truly a gentle giant when it came to infants and kids ."
"beau thumped his tail heartily at the attention ."
"aidan glanced up from the tv and smiled ."
"`` hey , how are you ? ''"
"she grinned as she reached down to kiss his cheek ."
"`` good thanks ."
"and you ? ''"
"`` great ."
"looking forward to having a man 's day with the boys . ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` yeah , with two kids under two , let 's see how much fun you 'll have . ''"
"aidan shrugged ."
"`` it 's good practice for me when the new baby gets here . ''"
"`` baby or babies ? ''"
"she teased ."
"with his eyes widening , he quickly replied , `` baby singular ."
"that was confirmed , thank god . ''"
"cocking her head , she teasingly asked , `` and when is the ultrasound to confirm the youngest fitzgerald granddaughter is on her way ? ''"
"aidan huffed exasperatedly ."
"`` not for a few more months , smart-ass . ''"
"she brought her hand to her chest in mock outrage ."
"`` it was just a question . ''"
"`` yeah and considering you 've had a kid yourself , i 'm sure you know all too well at what month the gender ultrasound is . ''"
"megan grinned ."
"`` i just think it 's cool that i 'll be the oldest granddaughter , and she 'll be the youngest . ''"
"with a pained expression , aidan groaned , `` whatever . ''"
"she ruffled his still unkempt bed hair playfully ."
"`` relax , ankle ."
"you 're going to be an amazing father to that little girl ."
"she 'll undoubtedly have you wrapped around her finger before she 's even out of the womb . ''"
"`` a man like me , or i guess i should say , a man like i used to be , does not want to bring forth daughters into the world . ''"
"`` payback is a bitch , '' she mused ."
"`` do n't i know it , '' he grumbled ."
"emma came into the living room then ."
"she handed noah to aidan along with a bottle ."
"`` you sure you 'll be all right today ? ''"
"`` i 'll be fine-we 'll be fine ."
"wo n't we mason ? ''"
"mason glanced up from lumbering around the room on beau 's back ."
"`` yeah ! ''"
"`` see ."
"stop worrying . ''"
"he gave emma a very pointed look before adding , `` a promise is a promise after all . ''"
"she flushed a little at his words , but then gave him a shy smile ."
"when he winked playfully at her , megan could n't help feeling her chest tighten at the exchange ."
"seeing her once man-whore uncle now a loving , devoted husband and father was always surprisingly unnerving ."
"but deep down , it was how much she truly wanted what aidan and emma had ."
"love , companionship , and devotion within marriage while having someone else to parent with you ."
"if you were n't so stubborn you could probably have something just like aidan and emma have with pesh !"
"but no , you have to keep believing that you 're too young to get married ."
"you 're probably throwing away happiness with both hands just because you 're afraid ."
"emma brought her out of her self-deprecating tirade ."
"`` so what should we do first ? ''"
"she asked , as they walked into the garage ."
"`` nails and toes ? ''"
"megan suggested ."
"`` mmm , that sounds good . ''"
"they both slid into emma 's suv ."
"as megan buckled up , emma turned to her ."
"`` i hope you do n't mind that casey is meeting us for lunch ? ''"
"`` of course not ."
"the more the merrier ."
"besides , casey is a hoot . ''"
"emma smiled and cranked up the car ."
"`` that she is . ''"
"before long , they were pulling into starbucks to grab some coffee for megan and tea for emma ."
"then they walked around the corner to the nail salon ."
"after relaxing manicures and pedicures , they drove about twenty minutes to meet casey at their favorite little local restaurant that was housed in an old train depot ."
"as they walked up , they saw casey sitting outside in the sunshine texting ."
"`` hey girl ! ''"
"emma called ."
"casey waved to them before rising off the bench ."
"`` hello , hello . ''"
"a round of hugs was exchanged between the three women ."
"`` i thought you two would never get here ."
"i 'm starving . ''"
"emma grinned ."
"`` sorry ."
"they were a little behind at the nail salon . ''"
"they pushed through the front door and were quickly seated by the hostess who knew them well ."
"once they eased into a familiar , comfortable booth , they took stock of the menus ."
"`` you have to order alcohol on our behalf since we 're both two knocked-up ladies now , '' casey insisted ."
"megan 's eyes widened ."
"`` i did n't know you were pregnant . ''"
"casey grinned ."
"`` yeah , nate finally wore me down . ''"
"she then shook her head ."
"`` sometimes i think he 's the chick in this relationship . ''"
"`` he must 've done some heavy convincing , '' megan said ."
"with a nod , casey replied , `` he comes from such a large immediate and extended family that he 's been itching to have a child ."
"we 've been married a year and together eight , so i guess it was just time ."
"and while i was n't thrilled with the idea of having a baby when his internship was so crazy , his hours will be better by the time the baby gets here . ''"
"`` when are you due ? ''"
"`` around the same time as emma . ''"
"that statement made emma beam ."
"`` our babies are going to be best friends , too ."
"i just know it . ''"
"casey grinned at the sentiment ."
"`` or boyfriend and girlfriend ... '' `` that 's a thought . ''"
"emma jerked her chin up ."
"`` i 'm not sure i want your son corrupting my little girl . ''"
"with her dark eyes widening , casey huffed , `` and what if it 's my daughter that your son is corrupting ? ''"
"emma giggled ."
"`` if my son takes after his father , then that would be the case ."
"but i think we also have to consider that if your daughter is anything like you , she 'll be the one doing the corrupting . ''"
"casey laughed ."
"`` that 's true . ''"
"`` guess i should keep mason clear of her too , huh ? ''"
"megan asked , with a smile ."
"`` probably , '' emma replied ."
"after the waitress appeared to take their drink and food orders , casey pinned megan with an intense stare ."
"`` so , '' she began , quirking her brow at megan ."
"`` i hear your doing your clinicals under dr. mcdreamy bollywood . ''"
"megan could n't help but laugh ."
"`` if you mean i 'm doing them under dr. nadeen , then the answer is yes . ''"
"emma nibbled on her bottom lip before speaking ."
"`` have things been awkward considering what happened the night of noah 's baptism ? ''"
"before megan could reply , casey 's eyes bulged ."
"`` whoa , whoa ."
"hold the phone ."
"something happened between you two ? ''"
"megan felt heat rising in her cheeks ."
"it was almost too mortifying to repeat , but finally , she filled casey in on each and every embarrassing detail that had happened ."
"`` man , he 's so freakin ' honorable , is n't he ? ''"
"casey mused ."
"`` yes , he is , '' megan replied , glumly ."
"emma shook her head ."
"`` there 's nothing wrong with his honor ."
"it 's what attracted me to him in the first place ."
"there are so few gentlemen left on the planet . ''"
"before she could stop herself , megan blurted , `` but i did n't want a gentleman ."
"i wanted to get laid . ''"
"casey grinned ."
"`` do n't we all ? ''"
"emma rolled her eyes ."
"`` just when i think your pregnancy hormones have n't made you even more sex crazed , you go and say something like that , '' she grumbled ."
"megan twirled the straw in her diet coke thoughtfully ."
"`` what 's bizarre is even though he should have been completely and totally turned off by what happened that night , he 's still interested in me ."
"i mean , the man is gorgeous and has half of the women in the hospital panting over him , and he still wants me . ''"
"`` then what 's the problem ? ''"
"emma asked ."
"`` he 's interested in dating , not sex . ''"
"emma 's brows furrowed ."
"`` but would n't you have sex eventually if you were dating ? ''"
"megan sighed ."
"`` we 're at a stalemate-i just want straight sex without dinner and a movie , and to quote him , he wants to show me a whole new world through a date . ''"
"`` how aladdin of him , '' casey quipped to which emma shot her an exasperated look ."
"with a shrug , megan replied , `` basically we 're going to stay forever in the friend zone because neither one of us is willing to give in . ''"
"`` would it really kill you to go out with the guy ? ''"
"casey asked ."
"megan widened her eyes in surprise ."
"`` you mean , you of all people are actually advocating me giving in to him ? ''"
"she jerked her thumb over at emma ."
"`` i 'd expect that out of her but not you . ''"
"casey dabbed the corners of her lips with her napkin ."
"`` it 's just a date ."
"i do n't think he 's going to drug you and drag you to a wedding chapel . ''"
"`` i 'd certainly hope not . ''"
"`` so what 's wrong with having an innocent dinner and maybe a movie ? ''"
"casey asked ."
"`` because that 's not fair to him ."
"i 'd just be leading him on , and i think we can all agree that he does n't need that . ''"
"`` exactly , '' emma agreed ."
"cocking her head , casey eyed megan thoughtfully ."
"`` deep down , you like him , do n't you ? ''"
"megan rolled her eyes ."
"`` of course i do ."
"everyone likes him . ''"
"`` no , you really like him ."
"you find yourself thinking about him more than you should ."
"and you 're kinda wishing you were n't such a stubborn ass about dating him ."
"because even though you 'd kill to know how well he uses his wang , you 're even more intrigued about what being loved by him would be like . ''"
"dumbfounded , megan could only stare at casey ."
"she 'd certainly hit the nail on the head about her feelings ."
"finally , she sighed ."
"`` look , it 's a no-win situation ."
"i 'm a nursing student ."
"i ca n't get involved with a physician ."
"it just would n't look good on my record ."
"that 's just one of the many reasons it would n't work between us . ''"
"`` fine ."
"you just keep telling yourself that . ''"
"`` why do n't we talk about something else ? ''"
"megan suggested ."
"`` who 's up for a movie after we hit the mall ? ''"
"emma asked ."
"megan chewed her lip ."
"`` oh , i do n't know if i should be gone that long ."
"i do n't want to take advantage of ankle 's kindness for watching mason . ''"
"emma shook her head ."
"`` he wo n't mind ."
"he 's happy to do it . ''"
"as megan raised her brows skeptically , casey snorted ."
"`` lem me guess , you bribed him sexually to get him to give up a perfectly good saturday watching two kids who are under two . ''"
"a red flush entered emma 's cheeks ."
"`` i do n't know what you 're talking about . ''"
"casey laughed ."
"`` oh em , you are so busted ! ''"
"leaning forward , she put her elbows on the table and stared straight at emma ."
"`` so what was it ?"
"green lingerie ?"
"a blow job ?"
"maybe a b**w j*b while wearing green lingerie ? ''"
"refusing to meet casey 's inquisitive gaze , emma finally murmured , `` it was a b**w j*b in the shower this morning , okay ? ''"
"casey snickered ."
"`` i knew you had done something ."
"hmm , that was fun ."
"it was like solving a sexual game of clue-it was emma in the shower with a blow job . ''"
"megan brought her hands up to cover her eyes ."
"`` umm , hello ?"
"that 's my uncle you 're talking about . ''"
"`` sorry , sorry ."
"i 'll refrain from making any more comments about aidan and emma 's sex life . ''"
"`` thank you , '' megan and emma replied in unison ."
"`` shopping and a movie then ? ''"
"casey questioned ."
"megan reluctantly agreed ."
"`` i 'll just blame you two if ankle gets all pissy . ''"
"casey winked ."
"`` just blame emma ."
"then he can take it out on her later ... in the bedroom . ''"
"`` i seriously hate you , '' emma grumbled ."
"thankfully , the food arrived then and all sex-based conversation was forgotten ."
"at least for the moment ."
"chapter eleven brushing his hand across his sweaty brow , pesh leaned back against the glass door of the trauma area ."
"as the adrenaline began depleting from his system , he needed to prop against something hard for support ."
"regardless of how physically drained he felt , he was emotionally on cloud nine ."
"a beaming smile lit up his face as he stared across the room at the gurney ."
"on it , a young woman was getting acquainted with her newborn son ."
"she had been brought in just twenty minutes before after a car accident sent her into early labor ."
"the paramedics had gotten her through the roughest patches , but thankfully , they had made it to the hospital in time ."
"because her labor was so advanced , they had n't risked getting her up to the labor and delivery floor ."
"instead , they 'd wheeled her in , and pesh had gone to work ."
"it really was an amazing moment considering he 'd only delivered three other babies in the history of his medical career ."
"each one was an experience he treasured ."
"the woman glanced up at him and smiled ."
"`` thank you so much , dr ."
"nadeen . ''"
"`` you 're very welcome ."
"they will be taking you up to maternity in just a few minutes . ''"
"as he stepped out of the room , he found himself ambushed by kara , one of the shift nurses ."
"`` hey there ."
"how 's the good doctor doing today ? ''"
"the way she spoke was more of a purr , which was a pretty apt summation since she basically acted like she was a cat in heat anytime he was around ."
"he cringed as she ran her hand up his arm ."
"`` it 's fine , thank you ."
"how are you ? ''"
"he questioned politely ."
"`` i 'm better now that i 've seen you , '' she replied ."
"`` yes , well , i need to go see about my next case . ''"
"her heavily painted lips turned down in a pout ."
"`` are n't you ever going to want to get a drink again ? ''"
"inwardly , he groaned ."
"in a moment of weakness when he was still reeling after what had happened with megan , he had allowed her to talk him into getting a drink after work ."
"once turned into several times , and then he did the unthinkable ."
"he had made out with her in his car under the faded lights of the bar 's neon sign ."
"well , making out did n't quite sum up the fact that she had given him a blow job ."
"although he had vowed to never let anything like that happen again , he found himself walking a fine line around her whenever they were at work ."
"`` um , sure ."
"maybe ."
"things have been really busy . ''"
"`` i hope that you 'll free up some time ."
"i really , really need a night out with you again . ''"
"reaching around him , kara did the unthinkable ."
"she squeezed one of his ass cheeks ."
"a gasp of shock behind him caused him to whirl around ."
"of all the people in the world that could have been standing there , it had to be megan ."
"pesh quickly jerked out from kara 's reach ."
"megan 's eyes bulged at the two of them before she quickly looked away ."
"with her head ducked , she started past them ."
"the last thing in the world he needed was for something to be awkward between them ."
"without another word to kara , pesh turned and fell in step beside megan ."
"`` what are you doing ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he shrugged ."
"`` nothing ."
"just walking with you ."
"is that a problem ? ''"
"glancing over her shoulder at kara , megan said , `` it looked like you were a little busy back there . ''"
"with a grimace , he said , `` the conversation and the contact were unwanted by me . ''"
"megan stared up at him ."
"`` why am i not surprised by that ? ''"
"he eyed her curiously ."
"`` just what do you mean ? ''"
"`` you are not the type of man who does public displays of affection ... or i should say lust . ''"
"`` have n't we already established that you should n't try to typecast me ?"
"i do n't fit into any of the preconceived holes you have tried to put me in . ''"
"`` there is one hole that you remain firmly lodged in , and that is being a gentleman when it comes to women and sex . ''"
"as much as he hated to admit it , she had a point about him being a gentleman ."
"he touched her arm , urging her to stop ."
"`` yes , i am a gentleman both in public and private ."
"but let me address part of your assumption ."
"when i am committed to a woman and she is committed to me , there is never a time i would reject public displays of affection or lust . ''"
"megan 's lips curved up in a smile ."
"`` so what you 're saying is you would actually grab your girlfriend 's ass in public ? ''"
"`` yes , i would . ''"
"glancing around , he found them happily out of anyone 's earshot ."
"`` when i am truly committed to a woman , i have trouble keeping my hands off her regardless of where we are . ''"
"`` that 's good to know , '' she replied , with a wink ."
"he could n't help the silly grin that filled his face as she hurried down the hall to join up with kristi ."
"he was making progress with her , was n't he ?"
"surely megan had to be seeing how much she enjoyed spending time with him in the hospital and would soon decide that she wanted more ."
"his smile started to fade as he wondered if he was deluding himself ."
"with a resigned sigh , he made his way over to the reception bay to sign off on some charts ."
"he eased down on a stool and immersed himself in the paperwork , so he did n't have to think about megan ."
"`` alpesh ! ''"
"a voice across the room shouted ."
"he snapped his head up ."
"without even looking over his shoulder , pesh knew who the voice belonged to ."
"few people in his life addressed him by his full name , and no one in the hospital ever called him by his first name ."
"slowly , he rose off his stool and turned around ."
"his youngest brother , dev , stalked toward him with a stormy expression plastered on his face ."
"as the oldest of his three siblings , he had always felt a responsibility to look out for his two brothers and sister ."
"while arjan and shveta had never given him any trouble , dev , as the spoiled baby of the family , had been a challenge for both pesh and his parents ."
"after experiencing teenage rebellion and a wayward early adult life , he had managed to get his wild ways under control when he was twenty-five ."
"dev had set his sights on a beautiful nurse pesh had befriended when he was still a resident ."
"mia martinelli had been through hell with an abusive boyfriend , so pesh was reluctant to pair the two together ."
"but at dev 's continued insistence , pesh fixed the two of them up ."
"what followed was a three-year courtship and then engagement ."
"mia was accepted and loved by all of pesh 's family ."
"and then dev had gone and thrown it all away by cheating on mia ."
"in her heartbreak , mia had stayed close to pesh , and he wanted her to be happy more than anything else in the world ."
"pesh would have liked to have been surprised by his brother 's visit , but ever since he had been summoned to console mia a few days before , he had been anticipating it ."
"truthfully , he had been bracing himself for his brother 's wrath ."
"`` hello dev , '' he said , in a calm voice ."
"shaking his head furiously , dev said , `` i just got a f**king blow off text from mia ."
"when i tried calling her back to demand she explain herself , she could n't talk because she was in mexico ."
"with aj . ''"
"`` yes , i 'm aware of that . ''"
"dev 's dark eyes narrowed at pesh 's confirmation ."
"`` so it 's true that you went to talk to her ? ''"
"`` yes , it is . ''"
"`` i ca n't believe it . ''"
"he threw up his hands in frustration ."
"`` i did n't want to believe anything mia said , especially that it was you who helped her see that she should n't give me a second chance and take me back-that she should make things work with aj . ''"
"`` it 's all true ."
"you and i both know mia would never lie . ''"
"`` but how could you ? ''"
"dev demanded , in a strangled voice ."
"`` i 'm sorry , but i had to do what was best for mia . ''"
"dev 's brows shot up ."
"`` and what about me ?"
"i 'm your f**king blood . ''"
"with a sigh , pesh replied , `` i 'm sorry , my brother , but blood or not , i could n't stand by and let you hurt her again-she 's been through too much . ''"
"`` i love her ! ''"
"dev shouted , which caused several of the nurses to spin around in shock ."
"`` this is not the time nor the place to be having this discussion , '' pesh growled ."
"`` i 'm not going anywhere , so you better start explaining yourself before i really start a scene . ''"
"pesh shook his head ."
"`` fine ."
"you want the truth ?"
"here is it ."
"you only think you love mia ."
"you and i both know you can not be faithful to a woman . ''"
"`` i could have for mia . ''"
"`` you already failed her once ."
"she deserved better . ''"
"dev narrowed his eyes ."
"`` what , are you f**king her now ? ''"
"he grimaced at his brother 's choice of harsh words ."
"`` of course i 'm not ."
"there 's never been anything amorous between mia and myself ."
"thankfully , she 's back with the man she loves-the father of her unborn child . ''"
"`` but i need her , '' dev insisted , his voice taking on a plaintive tone ."
"`` i 'm sorry , but i think it 's best if you moved on ."
"most of all , baby brother , i think you need to do a lot of soul searching and maturing before you even think about getting in another relationship . ''"
"dev 's eyes widened ."
"`` you ... you f**king bastard ! ''"
"he shouted ."
"pesh was debating calling security to remove his unruly brother when he was knocked off his stool by dev 's right hook to his jaw ."
"he tumbled backward and crashed onto the floor ."
"before dev could do something like kick him when he was down , megan appeared and wedged herself between them ."
"`` i think you better leave before i call security , '' she demanded ."
"pesh struggled to his feet as megan came into dev 's line of fire ."
"he could n't bear if dev hurt her in his anger just because she had taken up for him ."
"dev stared down at megan with a smirk ."
"`` so my brother needs some pint-sized pu**y defending him now ?"
"word to the wise , sweetheart , do n't waste your time on him ."
"he 's only got a boner for his dead wife . ''"
"a deep growl erupted in pesh 's throat as he lunged for his brother ."
"but he never made it ."
"instead , megan 's fist cracked into dev 's jaw ."
"the impact did n't take him off his feet , but he did stagger backwards ."
"even as she flailed her wrist back and forth from the obvious pain , megan still managed to bellow , `` get the hell out of here ."
"now . ''"
"dev stared at her in shock as he rubbed his jaw ."
"`` crazy bitch , '' he muttered , before stalking off ."
"when megan turned to him , her glowering expression faded to one of concern ."
"`` you 're bleeding ! ''"
"she cried , rushing for him ."
"his hand came up to grip his cheek ."
"surprise flooded him when he felt wetness ."
"dev must 've hit him harder than he thought ."
"he slid his jaw back and forth , causing him to grimace at the popping sound ."
"`` come here , '' megan said , grabbing his hand ."
"she started leading him over to one of the examining rooms , but he jerked back ."
"`` i do n't need all this fuss . ''"
"megan shook her head ."
"`` we need to get you cleaned up . ''"
"resignedly , he followed her into the room ."
"for the first time in a long time , he found himself on the opposite line of care ."
"he eased down onto the examining table ."
"`` really , megan , this is n't necessary . ''"
"as she busied herself taking out gauze , cotton balls , and antiseptic , she replied , `` quit your bitchin ' . ''"
"she glanced over her shoulder at him ."
"at what must have been his incredulous expression at her word choice , she grinned ."
"`` that 's right ."
"just shut up and let me take care of you . ''"
"`` when you put it like that , how can i not ? ''"
"he teased ."
"her laughter warmed his heart ."
"deep down , he was pleased to find her so attentive to him ."
"she obviously really cared about him if she insisted on cleaning him up ."
"or was she just attentive because she was a great nurse ?"
"but then there was the fact she punched dev for insulting him ."
"of course , that was also mortifying ."
"did that mean she questioned his manhood since he did n't go toe-to-toe with his brother ?"
"god , what she must think of him now ."
"as he allowed megan to treat his cuts , his thoughts turned to dev 's last verbal punch ."
"he grimaced about dev 's alluding to the fact he was in love with a ghost ."
"was that what stopped megan from believing his attraction to her ?"
"was she really hiding her commitment phobia behind a belief that he was still completely in love with his wife ?"
"his feelings gave him away when megan asked , `` are you hurting ? ''"
"`` no , i 'm fine . ''"
"when she gave him a skeptical look , he replied , `` it 's more the fact that i 'm angry than i am physically hurt . ''"
"`` so what exactly was all that about ? ''"
"she asked , as she dabbed some antiseptic along his jawline ."
"he winced when the medication hit the broken skin ."
"`` my brother is angry with me . ''"
"megan snorted ."
"`` no shit . ''"
"she held the cotton ball frozen as she eyed him curiously ."
"`` what i 'm wondering is what got him so fired up that he would stomp into a hospital , call you out , and then punch you ?"
"you are the last person on earth i would imagine being in a fight . ''"
"`` the reason is so cliche , '' he murmured ."
"`` enlighten me , '' she urged ."
"`` he 's a petulant child who did n't get his way-he 's lashing out at me because he thinks it 's all my fault . ''"
"`` i heard the name mia ."
"was it all about a woman ? ''"
"`` yes , that 's why i called it cliche . ''"
"he sucked in a harsh breath before filling megan in about what all had transpired between him , dev , and mia ."
"`` wow , '' she murmured , when he finished ."
"`` i suppose that is all one can say about the situation . ''"
"`` you were awfully kind to take care of her like you did-i mean , with both her abusive ex-boyfriend and dev . ''"
"he shrugged ."
"`` what else was i supposed to do ?"
"i cared for her , and i wanted to see her happy . ''"
"at the look that flashed in megan 's eyes , he quickly added , `` there was no amorous love between us ."
"i was happily married at the time , and she desperately needed someone to be strong for her . ''"
"megan cupped his unhurt cheek in her hand ."
"`` you really are the most decent man i 've ever known . ''"
"`` i do n't know about that , '' he murmured ."
"`` you truly are . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` no wonder women are so crazy about you ."
"it 's one thing for you to be so good-looking and a smart doctor , but then when you add in the fact of how sweet , caring , and compassionate you are , it 's like you 're a triple threat . ''"
"she turned to throw the cotton ball into the trash can ."
"his heartbeat thrummed louder and louder at her words while he sat unblinking and unmoving ."
"part of him wanted to rail at her for not seeing him like all the other women did ."
"if she truly saw what others did , then she would want to date him , would n't she ?"
"why could n't she see how good he could be for her ?"
"when megan met his tense gaze , she jerked back and momentarily faltered by dropping the piece of gauze in her hand ."
"she quickly deposited the soiled one in the trash and then got another one ."
"`` so this mia chick , she 's run off with some drummer , huh ? ''"
"she asked , clearly trying to change the subject and lighten the mood in the room ."
"`` not just any drummer ."
"a famous one at that . ''"
"`` really ?"
"what band ? ''"
"pesh 's cocked his head as he tried remembering ."
"`` something train . ''"
"megan gasped ."
"`` not runaway train ? ''"
"he snapped his fingers ."
"`` that 's it . ''"
"clapping her hand to her chest , megan 's eyes widened ."
"`` you know someone who knows aj resendiz ? ''"
"pesh laughed ."
"`` i suppose i do if you consider that 's mia 's fiance . ''"
"`` that is so wild ."
"i love that band . ''"
"`` i 'll see if i can get you an autograph . ''"
"with a squeal , megan said , `` really ?"
"that would be amazing . ''"
"`` anything for the woman who is willing to risk her life for me . ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` it was nothing . ''"
"`` what about your hand ? ''"
"`` i 'm not going to lie ."
"it hurts ."
"i kinda forgot what punching someone felt like . ''"
"pesh could n't help his brows from rising in surprise ."
"`` have you done a lot of fighting ? ''"
"she grinned ."
"`` not exactly mma material , am i ? ''"
"when he merely shook his head , she replied , `` i may have thrown a few punches in my early college partying days when a guy overstepped his bounds . ''"
"with a smile , pesh said , `` good for you . ''"
"`` yeah , my dad was really big on teaching me self-defense moves ."
"you know , with him being ex-military . ''"
"pesh could n't help liking megan 's strength and spunk ."
"he had n't known a lot of women like her ."
"in his world , women were bred to be demure and obedient ."
"even though jade was n't indian , she would 've never dreamed of throwing a punch to defend him against dev ."
"but megan , she was so refreshing with her ability to stand up for herself and others-to voice her mind whether it was good or bad ."
"`` you would have made your father very proud today . ''"
"`` thank you ."
"i 'm sure later on today when my knuckles are bruising , he 'll want to know why . ''"
"`` i 'm very sorry . ''"
"he took her hand in his before bringing it to his lips ."
"`` here 's a kiss to make any bruises go away . ''"
"she gave him a teasing smile ."
"`` is that the best medicine you can do , dr ."
"nadeen ? ''"
"his mind went wild with illicit images of all the `` medicine '' and `` healing '' he could give her ."
"a chaste kiss to alleviate her pain was all he could really offer ."
"his pager went off before he could reply ."
"`` i better go . ''"
"he hopped off the table and started for the door ."
"as his hand hovered over the doorknob , there were so many things he wanted to say to her ."
"but finally , he just said , `` thanks again for taking care of me . ''"
"`` you 're welcome . ''"
"`` and you should probably ice your hand during your break tonight . ''"
"`` yes sir , '' she replied , with a mock salute ."
"he shook his head at her with a smile before heading out the door ."
"chapter twelve days melted into weeks as megan immersed herself in her clinicals ."
"every day she found a new challenge to conquer ."
"she had n't imagined how hard it would be , or how exhausted she would be most nights when she crawled into bed ."
"but it was a thrilling exhaustion because she was doing what she felt like she was called to do ."
"each day , she spent more and more time with pesh ."
"she loved working beside him on cases ."
"he had the best bedside manner of all the residents and interns ."
"patients , both young and old , adored him ."
"and the more she was with him , the more megan began to adore him as well ."
"she had just left an examining room where he had charmed a little boy into finally letting them run the tests they needed when kristi beckoned her from down the hall ."
"after hustling to join kristi , megan was quickly ushered inside one of the trauma rooms ."
"immediately , her entire body switched gears as she prepared herself for what she might face ."
"`` female , thirty , car accident , '' the paramedic began before rattling off her vitals and other information ."
"after megan had absorbed the information , she turned to the patient ."
"`` hi , i 'm megan ."
"i 'm going to get your iv started . ''"
"the woman gave megan a weak smile ."
"`` i 'm mary . ''"
"`` i guess it would be wrong to say it 's nice to meet you , huh ? ''"
"megan said , trying to talk as normally as she could to put the patient at ease ."
"`` yeah , i guess so , '' mary replied ."
"when megan reached for mary 's arm to find a place for the needle , mary winced ."
"`` ouch . ''"
"as megan surveyed the forearm , she shook her head ."
"`` looks like you 've got a break there . ''"
"`` my arm is broken ? ''"
"mary asked in a panic ."
"`` we wo n't know until we get you into x-ray ."
"i 'm going to try this vein here in your wrist . ''"
"the needle slipped easily into the vein , and megan started the iv ."
"pesh appeared in the doorway then ."
"he smiled at mary on the gurney ."
"`` hello , mary , i 'm dr. nadeen ."
"i understand you had a little accident today ? ''"
"she nodded ."
"`` this car came out of nowhere and hit me head on . ''"
"`` i 'm so sorry ."
"why do n't we start by you telling me where it hurts ? ''"
"`` my chest , '' she said , with a grimace ."
"pesh pulled back the hospital gown ."
"`` were you wearing your seat belt ? ''"
"`` yes , i always do . ''"
"`` from the dust in your hair , can i assume the airbag deployed ? ''"
"`` yeah , it did . ''"
"`` is this where it hurts ? ''"
"he asked , running his fingers down an angry red whelp ."
"it started at her neck and crossed over her chest ."
"some of it was hidden by the many leads coming from the heart monitor ."
"`` yeah . ''"
"`` it looks like the seat belt and the airbag did a number on you . ''"
"mary winced ."
"`` i thought they were supposed to help you , not hurt you . ''"
"pesh smiled ."
"`` trust me ."
"you 're much better off with a little burn than if you had n't been wearing it . ''"
"after eyeing the monitors mary was hooked up to , he turned to megan ."
"`` blood pressure is low ."
"let 's administer some blood products to raise it . ''"
"megan nodded ."
"after checking mary 's chart for her blood type , she grabbed a bag of blood from the coolers ."
"trading places with pesh , she started another iv in the crook of mary 's right elbow ."
"`` besides your chest , are you hurting anywhere else ? ''"
"pesh asked , after he finished listening to her heart and lungs ."
"`` my stomach . ''"
"megan 's breath hitched ."
"it was never good for a car accident patient to have stomach pains ."
"that usually meant hemorrhaging , which could also attribute the low blood pressure ."
"pressing on mary 's abdomen , pesh asked , `` does this hurt ? ''"
"`` no . ''"
"`` here ? ''"
"`` no . ''"
"`` what about here ? ''"
"a screech came from the bed ."
"pesh 's brows drew with worry ."
"`` i 'm going to do a quick ultrasound , mary ."
"i want to see what 's causing the pain . ''"
"`` okay . ''"
"megan pulled the machine over to the bedside ."
"she squirted the jelly onto mary 's stomach , and then pesh began running the wand over the skin ."
"`` i 'm feeling a little dizzy , too , '' mary said , in a low voice ."
"pesh and megan exchanged a quick look before he shoved the ultrasound machine back ."
"turning to kristi , he said , `` call the or ."
"she 's got a ruptured spleen . ''"
"after depressing the break on the gurney , pesh swung it out of the trauma room and started down the hall ."
"`` go with him , '' kristi instructed , as she held onto the phone ."
"megan jogged down the hall to catch up with pesh ."
"he smacked the buttons on the elevator before glancing down at mary ."
"`` stay with me , okay ?"
"we 're going to get you into surgery , and then you 'll be good as new . ''"
"`` are you sure ? ''"
"she asked ."
"without hesitation , pesh replied , `` yes , but you have to stay with me . ''"
"the elevator 's doors slid open ."
"as megan helped pesh push the gurney inside , mary asked , `` did you turn on more lights ? ''"
"megan creased her brows in worry as she glanced over to pesh ."
"`` we 're getting in the elevator to take you to the or for surgery , '' she replied ."
"`` but it 's so bright , '' mary whispered before closing her eyes ."
"her head lolled to the side just as the alarms on the monitors began screeching in megan 's ears ."
"`` dammit , she 's crashing ! ''"
"pesh cried ."
"ice-cold fear pricked its way from the top of megan 's head all the way down her body ."
"a patient was crashing in the elevator without the crash cart ."
"what the hell were they supposed to do ?"
"`` lower the gurney , '' pesh ordered ."
"megan 's jerky hands fumbled with the lever ."
"once it was flat , pesh brought his hands to mary 's chest and began compressions ."
"without having to be told , megan leaned down , pinched mary 's nose , and began breathing into her mouth ."
"they worked in perfect synchronization ."
"`` stay with me , mary ! ''"
"pesh barked , as his hands pumped in a manic pace up and down on mary 's chest ."
"glancing up from her breathing , megan eyed the monitors ."
"`` no pulse . ''"
"when pesh did n't respond , she continued doing breathing cycles ."
"at the taste of something warm meeting her lips , she jerked back ."
"blood oozed out of mary 's mouth ."
"`` there 's more damage than the spleen ."
"she 's bleeding from the mouth . ''"
"pesh did n't even acknowledge her comment ."
"`` the seat belt and airbag could have caused an aortic tear as well ."
"there 's nothing we can do . ''"
"instead , he kept right on with his compressions ."
"the elevator doors opened , and megan met the expectant faces of the surgical team ."
"when one doctor stepped forward , she shook her head ."
"`` she 's gone . ''"
"pesh growled across from her ."
"`` no , she is n't ."
"we have to keep trying ."
"get a cart in here . ''"
"the doctor eyed the stats on the monitors ."
"`` i do n't think it will help . ''"
"jerking his head up from mary , pesh snarled , `` get the f**king cart ! ''"
"as one of the nurses scrambled away , two others pulled the gurney from the elevator ."
"megan stood back , feeling helpless as to what to do ."
"once the cart arrived , pesh ripped open mary 's gown ."
"`` charging 260 joules . ''"
"he rubbed the paddles together ."
"`` clear ! ''"
"mary 's chest jolted off the gurney with the force of the electricity ."
"megan did n't need to look at the monitors ."
"the heart stayed in a flat line ."
"`` charging 360 joules . ''"
"megan closed her eyes when pesh administered the second shock ."
"`` dammit , jade , do n't do this !"
"try for me ! ''"
"megan could n't hold back the gasp that escaped her at pesh calling mary by his late wife 's name ."
"before pesh could do another charge , one of the surgeon 's stepped forward ."
"after he removed his mask , he put his hand on pesh 's back ."
"`` calling time of death . ''"
"defeated , pesh dropped his head ."
"slowly , he eased back from the gurney ."
"a nurse took the paddles from him and put them back on the cart ."
"`` i 'll go notify the family , '' pesh murmured ."
"the surgeon shook his head and stared pointedly at megan ."
"`` get a resident to do that ."
"nadeen , you go take a breather , buddy . ''"
"`` they deserve to speak to the doctor who was with her when she died . ''"
"`` you do n't need to do this . ''"
"pesh slung away from the surgeon and started for the elevator ."
"megan knew there was no point in arguing with him or trying to get one of the residents to take his place ."
"she did n't know if she should try to go to him or not ."
"she regretted her decision when he turned to face her in the elevator ."
"his expression was agonizingly broken ."
"as the doors closed , her heart ached for him ."
"she knew any doctor hated to lose a patient , especially a young one , but this went far deeper than that ."
"from his behavior , megan knew that mary 's death had exposed a raw nerve in pesh-one that after two years still had n't healed ."
"somehow he had seen his wife in mary , and once again , he was n't able to save her ."
"after she had escorted mary 's body back upstairs to wait on the funeral home , megan went in search of pesh ."
"she could n't find him in any of the exam rooms , nor was he in the doctors ' lounge or break room ."
"finally , she went to kristi for answers ."
"`` did you see where dr. nadeen went ? ''"
"kristi gave her a sad smile ."
"`` you 'll probably find him on the roof . ''"
"megan 's brows shot up in surprise ."
"`` the roof ? ''"
"kristi nodded ."
"`` whenever he has a really bad day about his wife- '' she sucked in a breath when she realized she might have said too much ."
"at the thought of pesh 's grief , megan 's chest tightened in agony ."
"he was too good of a man to have to suffer like he did ."
"`` so he goes up to the roof ? ''"
"megan finished for kristi ."
"`` he likes to be alone to clear his head ."
"although none of us would say anything , he usually ends up pulling another shift to make up for the time he was gone . ''"
"of course pesh would do something like that ."
"he was honorable every moment of his life , even after those of immense grief ."
"even though she knew he probably wanted and needed to be alone , megan wanted to check on him ."
"she could n't bear the thoughts of him suffering so much ."
"`` um , if it 's okay , i think i 'll go ahead and take my dinner break . ''"
"kristi gave her a knowing look before nodding ."
"`` sure , honey ."
"go right ahead . ''"
"megan smiled before brushing past kristi ."
"she bypassed the break room where her purse was ."
"instead , she kept going ."
"after a brisk walk down the hall , she got to the authorized personnel only stairwell ."
"she did n't dare use the elevator shaft where trauma patients were brought in from being airlifted ."
"without hesitation , megan swiped her access card ."
"when the lock clicked , she flung the door open and started up the flights of stairs ."
"she was winded when she reached the top ."
"cautiously , her hand hovered over the doorknob ."
"she could n't help wondering what she might find on the other side ."
"would pesh be an emotional mess ?"
"would he be angry that she had interrupted his private grieving ?"
"shaking the thoughts from her head , she flung open the door ."
"as she stepped onto the roof , the air grew cooler ."
"a breeze rippled her scrubs ."
"her gaze spun around frantically until she found him ."
"pesh stood at the edge of the roof ."
"his usual ramrod straight posture was slumped , his broad shoulders drawn in ."
"although she could n't see his face , his gaze seemed fixed straight ahead into the night sky ."
"to add insult to injury , clouds blotted out the stars , cloaking everything in darkness ."
"tentatively , she started over to him ."
"`` hey , '' she said softly ."
"he whirled around in surprise ."
"her heart clenched at the sight of the tears sparkling in his eyes ."
"even in the darkness , she could see a blood-red flush entering his cheeks ."
"his hands quickly came up to swipe away the moisture from his eyes ."
"`` hello , '' he finally replied in a hoarse whisper ."
"they stood in an awkward silence , staring each other down ."
"finally , megan took a step forward to close the gap between them ."
"`` how did you know i was up here ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` kristi told me . ''"
"`` hmm . ''"
"unable to stop herself , she reached out to touch his arm ."
"`` i 'm so sorry , pesh . ''"
"`` it is n't necessary . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` yes , it is ."
"you 're in pain ... you 've been in pain ."
"i ca n't help but feel sorry for what you 're going through . ''"
"his usually warm eyes took on a cold look ."
"`` you were in that elevator , too ."
"you have every right to be emotional ."
"maybe you should be more concerned with why you are n't weeping . ''"
"`` do n't , '' she murmured ."
"`` do n't what ? ''"
"`` do n't try to mask your pain by being someone you 're not or by pointing fingers at others ."
"that is n't you , and you ca n't fool me . ''"
"with a ragged sigh , pesh jerked his hand through his dark , wavy hair ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"that was completely uncalled for . ''"
"`` it 's okay . ''"
"`` no , it's- '' she silenced him by bringing her hand up to cover his lips ."
"when she pulled her hand away , he sighed ."
"`` talk to me , '' megan pleaded ."
"the clouds above them opened up , causing a slight drizzle to fall ."
"`` the death of a patient is never easy ."
"any doctor of worth , or nurse for that matter , must possess compassion ."
"then it is inevitable that the same compassion you possess will come back to haunt you-it may even cripple you ."
"when death comes , you ca n't help feeling for the life that has been lost and for the family members left behind . ''"
"his voice choked off , and megan drew herself even closer to him ."
"she knew that his last statement held personal meaning for him ."
"`` what exactly happened to your wife ? ''"
"she questioned softly ."
"pesh 's eyes closed ."
"`` jade had an undiagnosed clotting condition ."
"she was adopted , so she did n't know anything really about her family history ."
"she 'd always been in perfect health-she rarely even went to the doctor with the sniffles ."
"and after we 'd been married for three years , we decided it was time to have a baby . ''"
"when pesh remained silent , megan tentatively asked , `` did she die in childbirth ? ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` no , we never got that far ."
"we tried for over a year to get pregnant on our own , and it did n't happen ."
"so we were recommended to a fertility clinic ."
"once the iui process did n't work , we started ivf . ''"
"a ragged sigh came from deep in his chest ."
"`` the whole process was physically trying and then emotionally gutting for both of us , but especially for jade . ''"
"he met her gaze ."
"`` she blamed herself since the testing revealed that everything was fine with me ."
"although we were labeled as 'non-specific infertility , ' she felt that it was all her fault . ''"
"`` bless her heart , '' megan murmured , as her heart went out to a woman she 'd never met ."
"getting pregnant had been so easy for her ."
"although mason was n't necessarily expected , he had never been unwanted in her eyes ."
"but she knew what infertility did to a woman when she saw it ravage her father 's sister ."
"although her aunt was now the happy and doting mother of two adopted girls , she knew the emotional toil not getting pregnant had taken ."
"megan , herself , had once been the recipient of her aunt 's childless pain when she had announced her pregnancy with mason ."
"still without answers as to how jade had died , megan pressed pesh for more ."
"`` so what happened with the ivf ? ''"
"`` she got pregnant on the first transfer only to miscarry three weeks later ."
"we had just been through another transfer when she died . ''"
"pesh 's adam 's apple bobbed up and down as he swallowed hard ."
"megan could only imagine he was trying to keep his emotions in check ."
"finally , he spoke again ."
"`` she had an embolism most likely brought on by the fertility medication ."
"i was in the kitchen making breakfast when i heard a crash in the bedroom . ''"
"tears pooled in his eyes ."
"`` when i called her name and she did n't answer , i ran back to her ."
"she was crumpled on the bedroom floor ."
"after calling 911 , i did cpr over and over again , but i could never revive her . ''"
"`` oh pesh , '' megan murmured ."
"the weight of his pain was so heavy that even she found it hard to breathe ."
"without looking at her , he continued staring straight ahead ."
"`` from what the medical examiner said , i have some peace in knowing she did n't suffer-that she went quickly without any fear or pain ."
"one minute she was getting ready for work , and the next she was gone . ''"
"`` it 's true that there is some peace , especially the fact she did n't know she was going to die ."
"sometimes i ca n't imagine what it must be like for terminal patients . ''"
"she shuddered ."
"`` when you wonder if every day is your last , when you have to think about all you 're going to miss . ''"
"`` yes , that is true , '' he said , in a hushed whisper ."
"when he finally turned to look at her , he gave her a sad smile ."
"`` it 's been two years ."
"every time i think i 've moved on , that i 've been able to compartmentalize my grief , a case comes through that brings me to my knees . ''"
"`` i 'm so sorry , '' megan murmured , bringing her hand up to cup his cheek ."
"he leaned his face into her hand ."
"his head bowed until their foreheads met ."
"`` you have to remember that no matter what happened to your wife , and to mary , it was n't your fault ."
"you were n't responsible ."
"you need to keep living ."
"you 're alive . ''"
"tilting her head up , she gazed into his dark brown eyes ."
"`` you 're alive , '' she repeated ."
"the rain began to fall harder ."
"her eyelids fluttered to keep the moisture out of her eyes as she gazed up at him ."
"his mouth hovered next to hers , his breath warming her cheek ."
"she could barely breathe in that moment ."
"it was like every molecule in her body was pulsing with need ."
"silently , she pleaded with her eyes for him to kiss her ."
"and then , after what felt like an eternity , he slid his lips over hers ."
"it was n't the first time she had kissed him-it was just the first time she was sober and had kissed him ."
"now her senses were heightened , and she could experience exactly what she was feeling ."
"his lips were tender and soft at first , and then they switched over to desperate and demanding ."
"it was like he was breathing her in with every brush of his lips and stroke of his tongue as if to prove to himself that he truly was alive ."
"his tongue danced along hers , causing her to moan ."
"he brought his hands up to cup her face while her arms went around his chest , pulling him closer to her ."
"drops of rain pelted her head and ran down her cheeks while pesh 's white coat grew moist as she ran her hands up and down his back ."
"she realized , in a dizzying flurry , that no man had ever kissed her like this before ."
"this was like lovemaking with their mouths , and she never wanted it to end ."
"when pesh finally tore his lips from hers , megan 's breaths came in heaving pants ."
"her eyes opened to stare up at him ."
"his expression turned from lust to anguish ."
"he shook his head ."
"`` i 'm sorry . ''"
"`` pesh , you don't- '' he held up his hand ."
"`` please , just go . ''"
"he turned away from her , wrapping his arms around his chest ."
"torn , megan did n't know if she should argue with him and stay or leave ."
"`` please , '' he whispered ."
"with her heart still beating wildly from their passionate lip-lock , she turned and fled ."
"as she pounded back down the stairs , her emotions yo-yoed to where she felt like a watch that had been wound too tight ."
"after bursting back through the door , kristi met her in the hallway ."
"her eyes widened at megan 's appearance ."
"`` i , uh , i went outside on my dinner break , and it started raining , '' megan lied ."
"`` next time you 'll have to remember your umbrella , '' kristi replied ."
"megan nodded ."
"`` yeah , i will . ''"
"`` why do n't you go to the break room ?"
"there 's a hair dryer under the sink ."
"when you finish drying off , i could really use you in the supply closet doing inventory ."
"seems like we always almost run out of everything at once . ''"
"`` sure ."
"i can do that . ''"
"as megan turned to go down the hallway , kristi reached out and grabbed her arm ."
"`` is he okay ? ''"
"megan bit down on her lip to keep a hysterical laugh from escaping ."
"was pesh okay ?"
"was she okay ?"
"who the hell knew ?"
"one minute he 'd been weeping about his wife and losing a patient , and the next he 'd been liquid passion dripping on her lips ."
"regardless of his emotional whiplash , she 'd experienced the same ."
"she now found herself wanting more of his kisses when she should n't ."
"but it was n't just the kiss she wanted-she wanted all of him and not just for sex ."
"`` no , he 's not ."
"i guess he 's just trying to accept the loss , both past and present , as best he can , '' she finally replied ."
"kristi nodded in acknowledgement ."
"when megan felt she was free from any more questioning , she hurried down the hall to the break room ."
"thankfully , she found it empty ."
"after grabbing a brush from her purse , she went to the sink to grab the hair dryer ."
"gazing at her reflection in the mirror , she looked a bedraggled mess ."
"she was practically washed out except for her lips ."
"they were swollen and bright red from pesh 's kisses ."
"her finger came up to trace her bottom lip ."
"as memories of his kisses filled her mind , she tried desperately to think of anything else ."
"in the end , she had gone up to the roof to somehow save pesh , and instead , she had lost herself to him and his emotions ."
"chapter thirteen pesh regretfully watched megan 's retreating form ."
"he cursed under his breath as she disappeared into the stairwell ."
"what was his problem ?"
"the woman had been merely comforting him , and he had allowed his libido to take over ."
"he had promised her he would keep his distance ."
"regardless of the flirting and easy banter between them , he had kept things professional ."
"now she probably felt trapped and harassed by him ."
"she tried to talk to him about it , and he 'd dismissed her ."
"he paced around the rooftop as the rain that had soaked him to the bone began to dissipate ."
"his mind was a jangled mess of thoughts and emotions ."
"one voice argued over and over that megan had wanted him to kiss her-that the look in her eyes told the truth ."
"but pesh worried that in his agony he had misread the signals she may or may not have been giving ."
"in the end , he 'd made a terrible situation even worse by not being able to control his feelings for megan ."
"with a frustrated grunt , he realized he had to make things right with her ."
"he needed to apologize ."
"casting one last look out over the horizon , he then turned and started for the stairwell ."
"after pounding downstairs , he searched the hallway for any signs of megan ."
"when he spotted kristi , he was surprised not to see megan with her ."
"`` where 's megan ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` oh , since we 're kinda slow tonight , i asked her to go work in the storage closet ."
"we 're behind on inventory and cataloguing . ''"
"`` i see . ''"
"kristi eyed him up and down before shaking her head ."
"`` you 're drenched . ''"
"`` it 's raining outside . ''"
"`` so i 've heard , '' she said knowingly ."
"`` what does that mean ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she waved her hand ."
"`` nothing ."
"why do n't you do us both a favor and go get out of those wet clothes ?"
"the last thing we need is you coming down with something . ''"
"pesh knew it was fruitless to argue with her ."
"instead , he tucked his tail between his legs and made his way to the doctors ' lounge ."
"he took a clean pair of pants and shirt out of his locker ."
"after he slid on a new white coat , he strode down the hall to the medicine closet ."
"after swiping his key card , he entered the room ."
"when he closed the door behind him , megan turned around , gazing expectantly at him ."
"now that he was in front of her , he did n't know exactly what to say ."
"he had been on an emotional overload on the roof , and things had escalated far too quickly ."
"`` look , i just want to say how very sorry i am about kissing you . ''"
"`` well i 'm not , '' she replied matter-of-factly ."
"pesh 's neck snapped back in shock ."
"her response was n't what he was expecting at all ."
"he had imagined she might be relieved or even embarrassed , but he had n't imagined that she would be unregretful ."
"he cleared his throat ."
"`` regardless , i should n't have done it ."
"i was in an emotionally vulnerable position , and you were merely trying to comfort me ."
"nothing more . ''"
"his words were more for his own good than hers ."
"she shook her head ."
"`` just because i was comforting you , does n't mean i did n't want you to kiss me ."
"that i still do n't want to kiss you again . ''"
"his brows furrowed in confusion ."
"`` but you- '' `` pesh , i 've wanted you since the night of noah 's baptism ."
"but you shot me down then , and you still do . ''"
"although his heart wanted to soar at her admission of wanting him , the reality of her words caused his chest to clench instead ."
"`` sexually ."
"you only want me sexually . ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"he should have been flattered that a young , sexy woman like megan desired him ."
"but he was n't ."
"half of the women in the hospital would be willing for him to drag them to an empty patient 's room for a quick and dirty screw ."
"but that 's not who he was ."
"he had never been that way with women , and he did n't see how it could be possible to change ."
"all he wanted was for her to really see him and how good he could be for her ."
"how good they would be for each other ."
"he thought that was what she was feeling in the moments before and after he kissed her ."
"but now it seemed it was once again only lust ."
"although it was probably pointless , he could n't help putting everything out there once again ."
"`` but when we were up on the roof , there was n't a moment where you wanted more from me than just sex ? ''"
"he licked his lips and took a step toward her ."
"`` just a second where you could imagine your life with me in it ? ''"
"megan stared at him , her expression contemplative ."
"for a brief moment , pesh thought by her hesitation that she had changed her mind about him ."
"but then she shook her head ."
"`` how many times are you going to make me hurt you with this ?"
"you 're too good for me , pesh ."
"we both know that ."
"i 'll remind you again of some of the reasons i 'm not the one for you ."
"i 'm twenty-five , and you 're thirty-seven ."
"you want a wife , and i 'm not ready to be married . ''"
"her words cut into his chest the same as if she had taken a sharp blade to him ."
"she may have had to repeat herself this time , but he realized the finality of her words ."
"and then an idea hit him so hard that he shuddered-a true light bulb moment and epiphany ."
"there was only one way he was going to get to have his sweet megan , and that was if he gave in to her ."
"he would have to become someone else for her , even if it was just for a little while ."
"he could distract her with sex that she both desired and demanded , but at the same time , he would make her fall in love with him ."
"it could work ."
"it had to ."
"cocking his head at her , he questioned , `` so let me get this straight once and for all ."
"you would let me ... '' he paused , fighting the conflict within himself to say what he needed to ."
"he drew in a ragged breath ."
"`` you would let me f**k you but not love you ? ''"
"her eyes widened at his word choice ."
"`` what 's gotten into you ? ''"
"he shrugged nonchalantly , feeling slightly empowered in the dr. jekyll and mr. hyde moment ."
"`` i merely asked a simple question . ''"
"she snorted exasperatedly ."
"`` yeah , about ... '' she swallowed hard ."
"`` fucking , of all things . ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"megan shook her head wildly back and forth ."
"`` i can barely acknowledge hearing you say the word , least of all you doing that . ''"
"`` you ca n't imagine me- '' she held up her hand ."
"`` you 're not the type of man to f**k , '' she countered ."
"crossing his arms over his chest , he countered , `` oh really ?"
"i 'm too nice of a guy ? ''"
"`` something like that . ''"
"`` i am a man , megan ."
"we all have needs ."
"is n't f**king one of them ? ''"
"her body trembled slightly at his words ."
"she licked her lips before replying , `` s-stop saying that word-it is n't you . ''"
"`` so , f**king is n't me ?"
"do n't tell me you think i 'm totally asexual-that you ca n't imagine me f**king a woman ... fucking you . ''"
"he eased in closer to her ."
"`` we both know for a fact that you wanted nothing more than to f**k me the night of noah 's baptism ."
"given the chance right now , you 'd let me strip off your scrubs and f**k you up against the medicine cabinet . ''"
"as her chest heaved up and down , she took a step back from him , bumping against the counter ."
"`` but you do n't say things like that ."
"you 're refined ."
"you 're a gentleman , '' she whispered ."
"`` it may have been a while , but even a gentleman like me enjoys f**king . ''"
"he closed the gap between them ."
"`` what are you doing ? ''"
"she whispered ."
"`` i 'm giving you what you want . ''"
"`` you 're giving in ? ''"
"`` yeah , why not ? ''"
"as he dipped his head , his mouth hovered over hers ."
"`` if you really want me to take you , then kiss me . ''"
"without a moment 's hesitation , megan crashed her lips against his ."
"the kiss was hard and desperately seeking more ."
"as his tongue thrust into her mouth , his hand came to her breast ."
"tenderly , he cupped the flesh , feeling the weight fill his hand ."
"unsatisfied with the lack of contact , he pulled his hand away and slid it underneath megan 's top ."
"over her bra , he kneaded her breast again , feeling her nipple harden under his touch ."
"he felt his erection grow at the sound of her whimper ."
"he wanted nothing more than to strip off all her clothes and kiss every inch of her body ."
"megan 's mouth popped off of his , and she stared up at him with hooded eyes ."
"`` what about someone finding us ? ''"
"`` i 'll lock the door , '' he replied ."
"reluctantly , he pulled away from her to walk back over to the door ."
"after he turned the lock , he made sure to push a box in front of it as well ."
"they would have enough warning if someone were to try to use their card to come in ."
"with his hands on her shoulders , he steered her behind one of the floor-to-ceiling shelves , concealing them even further from potential prying eyes ."
"`` now where were we ? ''"
"he asked , with a smile ."
"she grinned and wrapped her arms around his neck ."
"`` i think you were getting acquainted with second base . ''"
"`` yes , i remember now . ''"
"instead of his hands going back to her br**sts , he pulled her flush against him ."
"as his lips met hers , he slipped his arms around her waist ."
"he grabbed the globes of her ass and squeezed , causing megan to moan into his mouth ."
"his hands gripped her flesh , urging her upward ."
"rising on her tiptoes , she allowed him to hoist her up ."
"her legs wrapped around his waist ."
"once he had secured her to him , he rammed them back , until they bumped into the wall ."
"he ground his pelvis into her core , letting her feel how much he truly wanted her ."
"`` mmm , '' she murmured , as he continued rubbing against her ."
"one of her hands abandoned his shoulder and slid down his back to squeeze his ass ."
"his fingers jerked her hair back , pulling her lips back from his ."
"he gazed into her heavy lidded eyes before his mouth dipped to her neck ."
"his tongue slid up her jugular , feeling her racing pulse ."
"`` so you 'll let me inside your body but not your heart ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"`` yes ."
"please pesh . ''"
"now that he had her right where he wanted her , it was time to put his plan into motion ."
"`` if i give you an orgasm , you 'll have to go on a date with me . ''"
"her eyes widened through her panting ."
"`` you ca n't be serious . ''"
"`` oh , but i am ."
"give and take , megan ."
"i give you what you want- '' he paused in his thrusts to let his fingers dip into the waist band of her scrubs ."
"through the thin scrap of her thong , his hand caressed her , causing her to whimper ."
"`` which is to explode in bliss . ''"
"as he continued stroking her , she hissed in a breath as she glared at him ."
"`` you want me pretty bad , do n't you , megan ? ''"
"he asked , as his fingertips felt of her growing moisture ."
"her fingernails dug into his shoulders ."
"`` yes ."
"god , yes , i do . ''"
"`` so let me give you this pleasure ."
"i want nothing more than to see you come apart . ''"
"he licked his lips ."
"`` then you 'll let me take you out . ''"
"her eyelids fluttered , and she bit down on her lip ."
"he could tell she was internally raging war with herself about what to do ."
"as his fingers sped up their tempo against her clit , her head fell back against the wall ."
"`` you do n't play fair , '' she groaned ."
"he momentarily eased his hand off of her ."
"`` i do n't want to play games with you at all , but you leave me no choice . ''"
"he lowered his head to kiss her again ."
"`` all i want is you , '' he murmured ."
"`` fine , fine . ''"
"`` fine what ? ''"
"he questioned , as he looked her in the eye ."
"`` make me come , and i 'll go out on a date with you . ''"
"he smiled before easing her back onto her feet ."
"when he sank to his knees before her , megan 's brows furrowed in confusion ."
"he then gripped the waistband of her scrubs ."
"he eased them down , along with her panties , never taking his eyes off hers ."
"when he had them down to her ankles , he rose back up ."
"grabbing her by the waist , he shifted her to the side where she bumped into the counter ."
"he gripped her h*ps once again and raised her up to where her butt rested on the cool formica ."
"he slid her pants and thong over her shoes , letting the drop into floor below him ."
"he was so far gone with desire that he did n't stop to think how long it had been since he had gone down on a woman ."
"he pushed the voices out of his head when they reminded him of how jade had teasingly called his tongue a master of orgasms ."
"instead , he focused on the beautiful , panting woman before him as she widened her legs invitingly for him ."
"when he slid his tongue slowly up megan 's wet slit , they both shuddered ."
"he took one of her legs and propped her foot on his shoulder , so he could get better access to her while he pushed her other thigh further open ."
"her pink , glistening center was laid out beautifully before him ."
"as his tongue flicked and teased her swollen clit , megan threw her head back and moaned ."
"his lips closed over her clit , sucking it hard ."
"her h*ps began to rock back and forth ."
"he knew it was n't going to take him long to make her come-she was too ready for this ."
"it had been a long time for her as well ."
"he resisted using his fingers ."
"instead , he spread her apart and then thrust his tongue rhythmically inside her ."
"megan 's cries grew louder to where he brought his hand up and clamped it over her lips ."
"the last thing they needed was someone banging on the door ."
"as he felt her walls tensing , she reached out to twist her fingers in his hair ."
"he welcomed the pain as she went over the edge , convulsing and screaming against his hand ."
"when megan 's walls finishing clenching and pulsing , pesh removed his tongue from inside her ."
"he placed butterfly kisses against her core and then on the insides of her thighs ."
"when he finally glanced up , he found megan staring at him , a combustive mix of emotions swirling in her blue eyes ."
"`` that was ... '' smiling , he rose up from the floor ."
"his hands gently came to her waist ."
"he was just about to pull her down when she stopped him ."
"`` do n't ."
"i ca n't even feel my legs right now . ''"
"he brushed her hair back from her face ."
"`` it has been a long time , has n't it ? ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` how about never has it been like that . ''"
"he could n't help staring at her incredulously ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"`` i mean , that i 've never gotten off like that . ''"
"she gave him a sheepish grin ."
"`` at least not with a man . ''"
"at her insinuation , he felt warmth enter his face ."
"`` are you blushing about me mentioning masturbating ? ''"
"`` no , i 'm not , '' he protested feebly ."
"megan laughed ."
"`` you really are something else , you know that ? ''"
"`` i am ? ''"
"`` hell yes ."
"one minute you 've got your tongue buried inside me , giving me the most intense orgasm of my life , and then the next you 're blushing ."
"it 's like you became another person a few minutes ago ."
"you were forceful and domineering . ''"
"a shudder rippled through her as she raised her brows ."
"`` do you always get like that when it comes to sex ? ''"
"pesh felt even more warmth creeping into his cheeks ."
"how she could talk so frankly without any pants on , he had no idea ."
"`` we should cover you up . ''"
"`` you were enjoying the view a few minutes ago . ''"
"she leaned over and winked at him ."
"`` a very up-close and personal view . ''"
"he rubbed his hands over his face ."
"`` honestly , i do n't know what came over me ."
"i came in here to tell you i was sorry and that you would n't have to worry about me coming on to you again . ''"
"and then all hell had broken loose ."
"it was like he had been fried with the electrical current from the paddles on the crash cart ."
"he 'd decided to become another person to win her and damned if he had ."
"almost too easily for his liking ."
"what had he said to her in the heat of the moment ?"
"he stared intently at her ."
"`` all i could think of was how much i wanted you and what it would take to have you . ''"
"`` you really wanted me that much ? ''"
"she asked , her brows rising in surprise ."
"`` yes , i did . ''"
"with a coy smile , she scooted to the edge of the counter ."
"she wrapped her legs around his waist and drew him closer to her ."
"`` what about you ? ''"
"she asked , as her hand cupped his erection through his pants ."
"his h*ps bucked involuntarily , and he closed his eyes , trying to steady himself ."
"`` this was n't about me , '' he murmured ."
"`` i ca n't let you go back on the floor with a hard-on . ''"
"she licked up the side of his face , causing him to shudder ."
"`` i owe you at least a happy ending after those multiple orgasms you just gave me . ''"
"his closed eyes popped open ."
"`` multiple did you say ? ''"
"she giggled ."
"`` yeah . ''"
"`` then that means you owe me multiple dates , right ? ''"
"megan reached around to smack his ass ."
"`` you 're a bad boy trying to trick me . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i play dirty when i have to . ''"
"without another word , megan unbuttoned and unzipped him ."
"she eased his pants and boxer shorts off his hips ."
"when his erection was freed , she glanced between them ."
"`` hmm , pretty impressive . ''"
"he started to laugh at her remark , but when she gripped him in her hand , he gasped ."
"all coherent thoughts flew out of his mind as she stroked his length up and down , alternating from smooth slides to hard tugs ."
"`` would you rather it was my mouth on you than my hand ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` feels good no matter what , '' he muttered , his head dipping to rest against her shoulder ."
"her breath scorched against his ear ."
"`` mmm , i love that you 're so hard ."
"just for me , right ? ''"
"`` yes , '' he panted ."
"`` just for you ."
"only you . ''"
"flicking her tongue out , she encircled his lobe and the shell of his ear ."
"`` can you imagine what it would be like to bury yourself deep inside me ? ''"
"her words were having too much of an effect on him ."
"the dirty talk , coupled with the way she had her hand on him , caused him to tighten up ."
"he tried to pull away , but she kept hold of him ."
"and then he was coming undone ."
"when he finally came back to himself , he opened his eyes to see that he 'd come on megan 's exposed thighs ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he said ."
"`` it 's okay ."
"it was worth it to see your o face . ''"
"she smiled dreamily at him ."
"`` god , you were beautiful . ''"
"since he 'd never had a woman tell him that , he could n't help flushing ."
"he pulled away from her to search for something to clean her up with ."
"finally , he found a roll of paper towels ."
"when he returned to her , he gently wiped himself off her skin ."
"after he finished , he helped her down off the counter ."
"`` i 'll go out first ."
"i need to clean up ."
"and so do you . ''"
"he gave a brief nod ."
"he was having trouble processing all the emotions swirling through his mind ."
"`` so when it is ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` when is what ? ''"
"he asked dumbly ."
"he was still far too obliterated by a simple hand job to be processing coherent thoughts ."
"`` our date . ''"
"he had almost forgotten what he asked of her ."
"out of the heat of the moment , he felt guilty for what he had done ."
"he shook his head ."
"`` no , i was n't being fair ."
"you do n't owe me a date . ''"
"`` yes , i do ."
"i always keep my promises . ''"
"`` you 're really going to go out with me ? ''"
"she grinned ."
"`` of course i am . ''"
"his heartbeat sped up ."
"`` are you off this saturday ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"`` you do n't have plans ? ''"
"`` no , i do n't . ''"
"`` and you can get someone to watch your son ? ''"
"`` yessss , '' she replied , with a smile ."
"`` okay , then let 's do it saturday . ''"
"`` do what exactly ? ''"
"`` the date . ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` yes , but what are we doing ? ''"
"`` it 's a surprise . ''"
"tilting her head , she eyed him suspiciously ."
"`` i 'm not sure i like the sound of that . ''"
"`` i promise you 'll like it . ''"
"`` what should i wear for this surprise date ? ''"
"already the wheels had been turning in his head ."
"since it might be his only chance , he knew he wanted to make the date as special as he could ."
"`` wear something dressy ."
"we might be going somewhere that requires more formal wear than jeans . ''"
"`` okay , i think i can do that . ''"
"at the sound of his pager , he grimaced ."
"`` guess i 'll be the one leaving first . ''"
"without hesitating , he bowed his head to kiss her ."
"just like before , the feel of her mouth against his lit him on fire ."
"reluctantly , he pulled away ."
"`` go wash up first . ''"
"her breath warmed his cheek before she glanced up into his eyes ."
"`` i can taste myself on you . ''"
"he closed his eyes as a shudder went through his body ."
"`` you 're trying to kill me . ''"
"she flashed him a wicked grin ."
"`` sorry ."
"it 's the truth . ''"
"`` behave yourself , '' he replied , before he headed to the door ."
"chapter fourteen with less than ten minutes before pesh was set to arrive for their date , megan found herself a neurotic mess still holed in the bathroom ."
"she 'd changed outfits at least three times before deciding on a black and white lace dress that came just to her knees ."
"it had actually come out of the back of her closet-one of the tamer remnants of her wilder days ."
"pesh had told her to wear something dressy , and it did fall into the dressy category , although it was probably a little sexier than she would have liked ."
"while she 'd pulled her long hair back into a loose knot at the back of her neck , she was now rethinking her strategy ."
"if she 'd left her hair down , it would cover more of the exposed skin that the spaghetti straps and neck of the dress showed ."
"glancing at her phone one more time , she cringed ."
"`` fuck it , '' she muttered , before spritzing on some perfume ."
"after the fragrant cloud faded , she headed out of the bathroom ."
"she grabbed her purse and headed upstairs ."
"when she came into the kitchen , a loud , cat-calling whistle pierced her ear ."
"she scowled at sean ."
"`` seriously ? ''"
"he shrugged ."
"`` you look hot , sis . ''"
"gavin , who stood beside sean at the counter , nodded ."
"`` we never see you in anything but scrubs . ''"
"megan could n't help smiling at her brothers ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"wagging his brows , gavin asked , `` got a hot date , huh ? ''"
"`` not exactly , '' she replied , as she went to grab her purse ."
"`` yeah right , '' he mumbled under his breath ."
"after slinging her purse on her shoulder , she whirled around to pin him with her stare ."
"`` and what 's that supposed to mean ? ''"
"`` it means that chicks do n't get dressed up like that for nothing ."
"you obviously want to impress this guy ."
"so , it 's obviously a hot date . ''"
"`` since when did you become the love guru ? ''"
"she questioned ."
"sean grinned as he elbowed gavin ."
"`` she 's getting riled , man ."
"being irrational about little things usually means love . ''"
"megan opened her mouth to lay into her brothers , but then found herself speechless , so she closed it back up ."
"without another word to her brothers , she went into the living room ."
"she found her dad lounging in his chair with mason snuggled to his side ."
"when her dad looked up , he did a double take ."
"`` do n't you look beautiful , sweetheart , '' he said ."
"she bent down and kissed his cheek ."
"`` thanks , daddy . ''"
"mason tore his gaze away from the television to look at her ."
"`` mommy , bye-bye ? ''"
"this was one question she had n't anticipated explaining ."
"`` yes , mommy is going to go see a friend today , and you 're going to stay here with grammy and granddad . ''"
"his tiny brows furrowed ."
"`` mace no go ? ''"
"guilt rocketed through her ."
"how could she spend one of her few off days away from her son ?"
"the doorbell rang , and she was forced out of her self-loathing to answer the door ."
"taking a deep breath , she opened it ."
"her heart did a funny little flip-flop at the sight of pesh on the porch ."
"it was n't just how handsome he looked in his khaki pants , red button-down polo shirt , and black blazer ."
"it was also the fact he held a dozen red roses in his hand ."
"`` hi , '' she said shyly , after they had stared at each other for a few seconds ."
"he smiled ."
"`` hello . ''"
"`` would you like to come in ? ''"
"as he nodded , she stepped aside to give him room to come in the door ."
"he turned back to her and held out the roses ."
"`` these are for you . ''"
"after the words left his lips , he grimaced , as if what he had said offended him ."
"`` they 're beautiful ."
"thank you . ''"
"`` bye-bye kiss , mommy ! ''"
"mason called from the living room ."
"she smiled apologetically at pesh ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i 'll just be one minute . ''"
"`` take your time . ''"
"she hurried across the foyer and into the living room ."
"she deposited the roses onto one of the tables ."
"`` i 'll be back tonight ."
"you be a good boy , okay ? ''"
"she said , when she got to her father 's chair ."
"she leaned over and kissed both of mason 's cheeks ."
"`` give mommy a kiss . ''"
"he gave her a smacking kiss on the cheek ."
"`` bye , my love , '' megan said , before turning and heading out of the room ."
"she 'd just reached pesh 's side when he glanced past her ."
"`` what ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` i think we have a potential stowaway , '' he replied , with a smile ."
"she whirled around to see mason standing in the foyer ."
"`` what 's wrong , baby ? ''"
"`` no go , '' he whimpered ."
"she glanced up at pesh ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"he usually is fine about me leaving him . ''"
"she knelt down beside mason ."
"`` i wo n't be gone long , and you 'll have much more fun here with grammy and granddad ."
"pesh and i are doing boring , big people stuff . ''"
"`` no go ! ''"
"he cried , as big tears pooled in his eyes ."
"pesh knelt down beside her ."
"`` hey buddy , do n't cry ."
"i 'm not going to take your mommy away from you . ''"
"`` mace go ? ''"
"he asked hopefully ."
"megan shook her head ."
"`` no , sweetheart , i told you that we were going to do big people things today . ''"
"`` that 's true , '' pesh said ."
"then he smiled at mason ."
"`` but that does n't mean we ca n't take a little detour first . ''"
"megan 's widened her eyes in surprise ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"`` why do n't we take mason to lunch at his favorite place ? ''"
"`` you do n't mean that , '' megan argued ."
"pesh cut his gaze over to her ."
"`` sure , i do ."
"i can adjust our reservations . ''"
"she could n't help staring at him in shock ."
"how was it possible he was so willing to change his plans simply because mason did n't want her to leave ?"
"she fought the urge to reach out and touch his shoulder to make sure he was real-he was far too good to be true at times ."
"`` is that okay with you ? ''"
"pesh asked her ."
"`` of course it 's all right with me ."
"i was worried about it not being okay with you . ''"
"`` i would n't have suggested it if i did n't mean it . ''"
"he reached out and ruffled mason 's hair ."
"`` all right , buddy , where do you want to go for lunch ? ''"
"`` cheese !"
"cheese ! ''"
"he cried , as he bobbed up and down ."
"megan groaned as pesh 's expression grew confused ."
"`` he wants to eat cheese ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` no , he wants to go to chuck e. cheese-every parent 's worst nightmare . ''"
"pesh chuckled as he rose up from the floor ."
"`` all right then ."
"chuck e. cheese it is . ''"
"`` go get your shoes , '' megan instructed ."
"as mason raced back into the living room , megan stood up ."
"`` you really do n't have to do this . ''"
"`` honestly , i do n't mind ."
"we can go have lunch with mason , and then we can start our date ."
"i 'm sure he 'll be worn out and ready for a nap when we get back , right ? ''"
"`` yes , he will . ''"
"`` good ."
"then he wo n't have any reason to miss you if he 's asleep . ''"
"she smiled at his thoughtfulness ."
"`` thank you ."
"i really mean that . ''"
"`` you 're welcome . ''"
"he reached out and brushed her cheek ."
"when he started to lean in to kiss her , mason ran back into the foyer with his shoes ."
"pesh quickly jerked back ."
"to combat the awkwardness , megan busied herself with getting mason 's shoes on ."
"when she finished , mason bounded over to pesh and grabbed his hand ."
"`` go !"
"go ! ''"
"pesh laughed at mason 's enthusiasm ."
"he held his other hand out for megan ."
"she slid her hand into his and then they started to the car ."
"as megan walked through the doors of their local chuck e. cheese , she recoiled slightly at both the ear- splintering noise and the stomach-turning smells ."
"she also fought her embarrassment at the looks she and pesh were getting for their more formal outfits ."
"`` i think we 're a little overdressed , '' she said ."
"he held up his index finger and thumb before pinching them close together ."
"`` just a little bit . ''"
"tugging on pesh 's hand , mason dragged him over to the toddler area of games ."
"megan quickly dug in her purse for some money for tickets ."
"after she bought them , she went over to pesh ."
"`` i 'll go grab us some pizza . ''"
"she waved the tickets at him ."
"`` once these are gone , he 's done . ''"
"`` i do n't mind getting him more . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` trust me ."
"he 's done . ''"
"`` okay then , '' he replied good-naturedly ."
"megan felt completely at ease leaving pesh to watch mason ."
"she got them a couple of slices of mason 's favorite , pepperoni , along with some drinks and then made her way over to a table close to the toddler area ."
"when she caught pesh 's eye , she waved them over ."
"after several tense moments , he was finally able to convince mason to leave the play area to come and eat ."
"as mason bounced around in his seat , megan knew she would be doing good to get four bites of pizza down him before he was raring to go play again ."
"she also had a fear that she , pesh , or the both of them were going to be wearing tomato sauce before it was all said and done ."
"`` this place is very interesting , '' pesh remarked , as he gazed around ."
"megan laughed ."
"`` have you never had the pleasure ? ''"
"`` sadly no ."
"my brother , arjan 's , and his children live in florida , so i 've really never had a reason to come . ''"
"`` you 've dodged a bullet there ."
"that 's for sure . ''"
"he smiled before taking a bite of his pizza ."
"his expression turned so sour that megan could n't help giggling ."
"`` this is terrible , '' he muttered ."
"`` i should have warned you not to bother eating ."
"it only seems appetizing to small children who are hyped up on adrenaline . ''"
"he took a long swig from his coke and swished the liquid around like he was trying to rid himself of the taste ."
"when he caught mason looking at him , he put on a fake smile ."
"`` mmm , that 's good pizza ."
"you better eat yours before i do . ''"
"`` nice save , '' she murmured ."
"he winked at her as he threw his napkin on his plate ."
"she could n't believe when her heart fluttered at his gesture ."
"it was almost impossible to believe that she could be getting feelings for him in the middle of chuck e. cheese ."
"`` done ."
"go play , '' mason announced , bringing her out of her thoughts ."
"she shook her head ."
"`` i do n't think so ."
"you need to eat more . ''"
"mason scowled at her before grabbing another bite and shoveling it into his mouth ."
"he managed to clean his plate with a little coaxing from pesh ."
"then the two of them went back over to the play area ."
"as megan watched them , the small ache in her chest began to grow ."
"pesh was completely hands on , hoisting mason up where he could reach things and then catching him when he came off the slide ."
"he seemed to genuinely enjoy spending time with mason ."
"some guys would have played with mason only to get on her good side ."
"but pesh did n't have an agenda when it came to her , unless it was to have her embrace the idea of a relationship with him ."
"when the last ticket was spent , she rose off her chair ."
"`` okay , time to go . ''"
"mason 's face scrunched up , and he looked like at any minute he might throw a tantrum to stay ."
"but pesh took his hand ."
"`` we 'll come back another time . ''"
"his reply seemed to pacify mason , and he happily slung his and pesh 's arm back and forth as they walked to the car ."
"when they got buckled up , megan turned back to mason ."
"`` what do you say to pesh for bringing you ? ''"
"`` tank you , esh , '' mason said ."
"his words sent a broad grin stretching across pesh 's face ."
"`` you 're welcome , buddy ."
"i had a good time . ''"
"when he glanced over at megan , she gave him a genuine smile ."
"`` i had a good time , too . ''"
"taking one of his hands off the steering wheel , he reached over to take her hand in his ."
"while the gesture was a little too lovey-dovey for her liking , she did n't argue with him ."
"instead , she just enjoyed his touch ."
"once they had deposited a sleepy mason back home at megan 's , they abandoned her suv and gotten into pesh 's jaguar ."
"`` so where exactly are we going ? ''"
"megan asked , as she buckled her seat belt ."
"`` it 's a surprise . ''"
"`` seriously ?"
"you 're still playing coy about it ? ''"
"`` for just a little while longer . ''"
"she shifted in her seat where she could look at him better ."
"`` can i try to guess ? ''"
"`` i suppose ."
"i 'm not sure i 'd tell you even if you guess , '' he teased ."
"`` are we going to atlanta ? ''"
"he cut his gaze from the road over to her ."
"`` have patience . ''"
"crossing her arms over her chest , she huffed , `` i do n't have patience for games . ''"
"`` okay , i 'll give you a little hint ."
"actually , it 's more of a question than it is a hint . ''"
"`` yeah ? ''"
"`` do you have a fear of heights ? ''"
"she snorted ."
"`` no , i do n't ."
"why ? ''"
"he gave her a sly grin ."
"`` i told you ."
"it 's a hint . ''"
"`` i went skydiving when i turned twenty-one , so i 'm totally fine with heights ."
"of course , i seriously doubt we 're going sky diving in these clothes . ''"
"`` no , we 're not . ''"
"she wrinkled her nose ."
"`` please tell me it 's not box seats at the opera or something like that . ''"
"his face fell ."
"`` you do n't like the opera ? ''"
"`` never been and never want to . ''"
"pesh appeared almost personally insulted ."
"`` i 'm going to have to change your mind on that one . ''"
"`` why am i not surprised you like opera ? ''"
"`` do n't knock it until you 've tried it . ''"
"`` a bunch of screeching men and women singing in a language i do n't understand ?"
"not my idea of a good time . ''"
"`` but there is such love and passion in their delivery , '' he argued ."
"`` um , i 'm just going to have to agree to disagree with you . ''"
"`` for now at least , '' he said , with a wink ."
"when the car started slowing down , megan peered out the windshield before turning to pesh ."
"`` we 're at mccollum ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"`` you 're taking me flying ? ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` yes , i am . ''"
"even though she had known he had a plane from how he 'd helped get aidan to noah 's delivery , she could n't believe their date included something as unique as flying ."
"`` so let me get this straight ."
"i 'm dressed like this , '' she did a little hand motion over her dress , `` to go flying ? ''"
"an amused look twinkled in his dark eyes ."
"`` you have absolutely no patience , do you ? ''"
"`` no , i do n't . ''"
"as he put the car in park outside the hanger , he turned to her ."
"`` by your lack of being able to withhold gratification , i 'm assuming you 've never partaken in any tantric sex ? ''"
"she could n't stop her mouth from dropping to her chest ."
"`` w-what ? ''"
"she stammered ."
"turning in his seat , he pinned her with a hard stare ."
"`` have i managed to shock you again ? ''"
"unable to speak , she merely bobbed her head ."
"pesh only chuckled at her response ."
"`` come on ."
"let 's get going . ''"
"still in shock , she remained rooted to her seat ."
"when he came around to open her door , she peered up at him ."
"`` tantric sex ?"
"like sting , trudie styler , and tantric sex ? ''"
"`` yes , i suppose so , '' he replied , as he offered her his hand ."
"ordinarily , she would n't have taken it , but at the declaration that pesh was actually into something outside the sexual norms , she was too floored to argue with him ."
"`` i did n't think you 'd like anything ... kinky . ''"
"pesh 's dark eyes widened ."
"`` tantric is n't kinky ."
"it 's about connecting with your lover on a more intimate level ."
"it 's about breathing them in and truly being one . ''"
"`` so it 's not about marathon sex that lasts for days ? ''"
"he chuckled ."
"`` you 've gotten the more salacious side confused with what it actually is . ''"
"megan pursed her lips at him as her mind whirled with the possibilities ."
"after all , if tantric sex with pesh was anywhere as good as his efforts in going down on her , she was one very lucky lady ."
"`` i guess you 'll just have to educate me . ''"
"they were interrupted by an air traffic controller with a headset ."
"`` hey , dr. nadeen , how goes it ? ''"
"`` good ."
"thank you ."
"everything ready to go , lewis ? ''"
"pesh asked , as he pumped the man 's hand ."
"`` gassed up and checked out ."
"we just need your flight plan . ''"
"pesh 's gaze went to megan before he said , `` we 'll be flying into savannah/hilton head airport . ''"
"`` great ."
"thanks , '' lewis replied , before he started back inside the hanger ."
"`` you 're taking me to savannah ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` for dinner and dancing ."
"i had originally intended on more , but we got a later start . ''"
"`` this is crazy ."
"you 're crazy . ''"
"he gave her a puzzled look ."
"`` you do n't like savannah ? ''"
"`` no , i love it ."
"i just meant taking me four hours away for dinner . ''"
"`` it 's not that long by plane . ''"
"crossing her arms over her chest , she tilted her head at him ."
"`` you could n't just take me somewhere fancy in atlanta ?"
"you have to fly me in your private plane to another city ? ''"
"he shrugged ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"although it was probably unattractive , she could n't help snorting with contempt ."
"`` i 'm probably going to sound a little like the line from pretty woman when she says she appreciates the seduction scene , but she 's a sure thing . ''"
"she patted her chest ."
"`` i am a sure thing ."
"you do n't have to go to all this trouble . ''"
"his dark eyes narrowed ."
"`` your way of thinking is precisely why i 'm doing what i am . ''"
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"`` you 've only been with men who wanted a sure thing-men who did n't even bother trying to imagine a future with you past when they came at the end of the night . ''"
"she sucked in a breath at his words ."
"with his expression softening , he closed the gap between them ."
"`` while you may only want sex from me , i want far more from you ."
"i want your time , but i also want you to understand that you 're worthy of something special ."
"and if it takes planes and fancy meals to prove it to you , then i 'm going to do it . ''"
"after his argument , megan sat frozen in dumbfounded silence ."
"how was it possible that he knew so much about her ?"
"he was right in the fact that she settled for being the 'sure thing ' for the guys she dated in the past ."
"she knew she did n't want to make those mistakes again , so why should n't she let him try to wine and dine her ?"
"`` fine ."
"take me to savannah . ''"
"he opened the passenger side door ."
"`` here you go ."
"make sure you buckle your seat belt . ''"
"she nodded before she dipped inside the plane ."
"pesh waited for her to adjust her dress before he closed the door ."
"as he walked around the front of the plane , she got busy finding the seat belt and buckling up ."
"once he climbed inside , he handed her a headset ."
"`` this will help with the cabin noise . ''"
"`` it 's going to mess my hair up , '' she complained ."
"he laughed ."
"`` i never took you as the type of woman who worried about her hair . ''"
"she grinned as she eased the headset on ."
"`` now you know ."
"i worry about my hair , and you get your freak on in the bedroom . ''"
"he rolled his eyes at her and turned in his seat ."
"after placing his headset on , he started flipping switches and turning knobs ."
"the propeller on the front of the plane started whirling ."
"`` so what kind of plane is this ? ''"
"she asked over the noise ."
"holding up a finger , he spoke into the mic on the headset ."
"`` ground to tower , this is cessna 172 requesting to taxi for takeoff . ''"
"suddenly the sound of the tower came over her headset ."
"`` clearance for taxi and takeoff , cessna 172 . ''"
"`` roger that , '' pesh replied ."
"the plane lurched forward and then started taxing down the runaway ."
"`` hmm , i 'm guessing a cessna 172 ? ''"
"pesh smiled ."
"`` yes , it is . ''"
"`` it 's nice ."
"i like it . ''"
"`` i hope you 'll be saying that again in a minute . ''"
"megan knew what he meant when the plane started gaining speed down the runaway ."
"just like when she was on a commercial flight , it was on the ground one minute , and then in the air the next ."
"they soared into the blue sky while zipping through white , fluffy clouds ."
"once they had gained enough altitude , pesh eased off on the rudder and glanced over at her ."
"`` you okay over there ? ''"
"she grinned ."
"`` are you kidding me ?"
"this is amazing . ''"
"`` i 'm glad to hear you like it ."
"i did n't know if you were going to take after your uncle aidan . ''"
"`` i hear you gave him drugs to make it . ''"
"pesh laughed ."
"`` yeah , i did ."
"he slept most of the way there . ''"
"`` total wuss , '' she remarked with a smile ."
"after adjusting one of the controls , pesh said , `` well , i have to admit that my late wife was n't a fan , either ."
"she tolerated flying with me because she knew how much i loved it , but most of the time , she 'd take a pill to relax . ''"
"`` so she did n't share your passion ? ''"
"`` no , she did n't ."
"she always encouraged me to do what i loved ."
"she never was one to make me choose between her or something else ."
"she was that sacrificing . ''"
"`` that was really amazing of her to be that giving . ''"
"when pesh remained silent , megan knew it was time for a conversation change ."
"`` now that i know we 're going to savannah , are you going to tell me where we 're going for dinner ? ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` it 'll probably be a late lunch when we get there . ''"
"`` so , where will our late lunch be ? ''"
"`` do you like the historic district ? ''"
"`` i love it . ''"
"`` good ."
"i 've picked a restaurant there for us . ''"
"`` do you come to savannah often ? ''"
"`` a couple of times a year , mainly for medical conferences on the coast . ''"
"`` and you always fly ? ''"
"`` i do , '' he replied , with a smile ."
"the flight took less time than she thought , and with clear weather , it was totally smooth ."
"as they started making their descent , pesh glanced over at her ."
"`` are you ready for the landing ? ''"
"`` sure ."
"why would n't i be ? ''"
"`` it can be a little intense for some people ."
"you see a lot more of the ground rushing at you than when you 're in a 747 . ''"
"she cocked her head at him ."
"`` i went skydiving , remember ? ''"
"`` ah , that 's right . ''"
"with a wink , he added , `` you 're my little adrenaline junkie . ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` i was ."
"not anymore . ''"
"`` what changed all that ? ''"
"`` mason ."
"when you 're responsible for the health , safety , and happiness of someone else , your entire perspective changes . ''"
"`` he 's a true gift . ''"
"she jerked her gaze to him ."
"`` yes , he is . ''"
"pesh gave her a small smile before radioing the tower ."
"once he had clearance to land , they started rapidly losing altitude ."
"the runway got closer and closer until the plane jolted forward and then began skidding along the pavement ."
"when it finally came to a shuddering stop , megan exhaled the breath she 'd been holding ."
"`` still okay ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"she grinned ."
"`` never better . ''"
"the sound of the tower came in her headset as pesh listened to the instructions ."
"the plane started rolling toward one of the hangers ."
"once he had parked and powered down the plane , he got out to help her ."
"after a quick talk with a member of the grounds crew , pesh took her hand and led her out of the hanger ."
"a cab waited to take them into the city ."
"she laughed as she slid across the seat ."
"`` what ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` i 'm surprised by the cab ."
"i thought you might really go upscale by having a limo or chauffeur-driven car pick us up . ''"
"`` i like to stay humble , '' he replied with a wink ."
"she shook her head at him before turning to gaze out the window at the scenery ."
"when they began winding through the antebellum homes of the historic district , megan felt her stomach growl ."
"she 'd been too nervous to eat breakfast , and then she had n't dared eat at chuck e. cheese 's ."
"the cab stopped outside a chic looking restaurant ."
"as pesh paid the driver , megan hopped out and took in the sights around her ."
"she loved the old world feel of the city with all its history and charm ."
"pesh offered her his arm , and then they walked inside ."
"the restaurant 's popularity was evident in how crowded it was even at four in the afternoon ."
"they were ushered to a quiet , candlelit table ."
"`` wine ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` yes please . ''"
"`` white okay ? ''"
"`` sure . ''"
"after the waiter left with their drink order , megan surveyed the menu and sighed ."
"`` everything looks so good . ''"
"glancing over his menu at her , pesh said , `` with the cuisine being southern , i imagined you would like it . ''"
"`` i love all types of food ."
"trust me , as hungry as i am now , i would have eaten anywhere . ''"
"the waiter returned with their wine , and megan knew she needed to make a decision ."
"`` i 'll have the shrimp and grits , please . ''"
"`` very good , ma'am , '' the waiter replied ."
"`` i 'll have the same , '' pesh said , handing the waiter his menu ."
"when megan grinned at him , his brows rose ."
"`` what ? ''"
"`` i 'm just surprised to hear you eating something so southern as shrimp and grits . ''"
"he tsked at her ."
"`` when will you learn that you can never pigeonhole me as one thing or the other ? ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` actually , i like that you 're proving me wrong and being unexpected . ''"
"`` really ? ''"
"she nodded ."
"`` sometimes i feel like people try to do the same thing to me ."
"people have their own assumptions about girls or women who get knocked up ."
"i hope i constantly prove them wrong . ''"
"`` i 'm sure you do . ''"
"after taking a sip of his wine , he cocked his head at her ."
"`` prove me wrong on this one ."
"does a southern girl like you eat indian food ? ''"
"`` oh yes , i love it . ''"
"his dark eyes lit up ."
"`` what 's your favorite dish ? ''"
"`` hmm , i love butter chicken , but i 'm also a fan of pav bahaji . ''"
"`` i 'm impressed ."
"emma had never eaten any indian food , and i do n't think i made a good impression on her . ''"
"pesh 's chuckle died out , and he immediately grimaced at the mention of emma 's name ."
"knowing that they were dancing around the white elephant in the room , megan reached across the table and patted his hand ."
"`` it 's okay that you 're talking about emma . ''"
"`` speaking of old girlfriends or women you 've dated while you 're with another woman is never a good idea . ''"
"`` this is different ."
"emma is my family . ''"
"she swirled the wine around in her glass ."
"`` i 've heard her side of the story , but i do n't think i 've heard yours . ''"
"`` you heard a little when you were inebriated the night of noah 's baptism . ''"
"now it was megan 's turn to grimace ."
"`` i still would like to know . ''"
"pesh drew in a ragged breath ."
"when the waiter appeared with their salads , it appeared that he might dodge the question entirely ."
"but once they were alone together , he smiled ."
"`` emma came along at a time when i was facing extreme pressure from family and friends to move on from my grief and date again ."
"there was no escape to it-i faced it at the hospital , as well as when i was at home ."
"people seemed to think that once a year went by on the calendar that meant i was through with my mourning ."
"then one day , there she was in the er ."
"she was scared out of her mind about your grandfather ."
"somehow i just connected with her through her grief and pain . ''"
"he dabbed his mouth with his napkin ."
"`` she reminded me so much of jade that it was easy to try to imagine that what i was feeling for her was romantic ."
"i had n't been out in so long that i wanted to woo her , just like i wanted to you . ''"
"`` and aidan came between you ? ''"
"`` in a way , both he and jade did . ''"
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"pesh laughed ."
"`` let 's just say , during a very heated moment together , she was with aidan , and i was with jade . ''"
"megan was surprised by his candor ."
"`` i see . ''"
"there was one item in the pesh and emma equation she had always wondered about ."
"`` you did n't mind that she was pregnant ? ''"
"shaking his head , pesh replied , `` it just made her even more beautiful to me ."
"i 'd been through so much death that i guess i was drawn to her because she had life growing within her . ''"
"`` that 's really beautiful , '' megan murmured ."
"he gave her a mirthless laugh ."
"`` one of my worst character faults is having a hero complex ."
"i guess it 's one of the reasons i became a doctor ."
"i saw emma , and i wanted to save her ."
"when she had to go on bed rest , i wanted to be her knight in shining armor . ''"
"`` being a hero is not exactly a bad character trait . ''"
"`` it is when you ca n't save someone , and you have to constantly live with the guilt . ''"
"megan 's heart ached at the pain on his face ."
"sensing she needed to lighten the mood , she teased , `` i 'm glad to hear you actually have a bad character trait ."
"i mean , you seemed a little too perfect to me . ''"
"a shadow of a smile played on his lips ."
"`` did i mention i 'm a terrible slob ? ''"
"`` you ?"
"never , '' she replied ."
"`` oh yes ."
"if i did n't have a housekeeper , i 'm pretty sure i might end up on world 's nastiest houses . ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` i find that hard to believe . ''"
"`` it 's the truth ."
"i also have no athletic ability whatsoever . ''"
"after chewing thoughtfully on her bite of salad , megan said , `` but you 're built like a football player . ''"
"`` i 'm built because i go to the gym to work off stress ."
"but if you put me on the field , i 'd be a serious disappointment . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` that does n't turn me off at all ."
"i 've had my fill of jocks . ''"
"`` oh ? ''"
"he questioned ."
"although he was trying to be nonchalant about it , she knew he wanted to hear the full story ."
"`` dating jocks for me is poison , and when i did date one , i made sure to date the ones at the top of their game ."
"my first athlete 's influence caused me to ruin my chances at medical school . ''"
"`` that 's horrible . ''"
"`` yes , it is ."
"but what 's worse is i did n't learn anything from my mistakes because i fell for another one . ''"
"with a rueful smile , she added , `` at least i got mason out of that one . ''"
"pesh laced his fingers together ."
"`` mason 's father is a professional athlete ? ''"
"`` yes , he plays football for the falcons . ''"
"`` you know i 'm friends with the team 's sports medicine doctor ."
"i could probably arrange something for him ."
"maybe a little icy hot in his cup ? ''"
"at the mischievous twinkle in pesh 's eyes , megan burst out laughing ."
"`` i can not believe , you of all people , suggested such a thing . ''"
"with a shrug , pesh replied , `` it 's a harmless prank . ''"
"`` i realize that ."
"it 's just i ca n't imagine someone like you would even think of doing something like that . ''"
"when he started to open his mouth to argue , she held up her hand ."
"`` i know , i know ."
"do n't pigeon hole you . ''"
"`` exactly . ''"
"their main course arrived , and megan could n't help digging into the wonderful aromatic food ."
"as they ate , the conversation came easily ."
"that was one of the things she liked most about pesh-he was so easy to talk to ."
"because he was older , refined , and a doctor , she could have felt intimidated by him ."
"but he never made her feel that way ."
"he always seemed fascinated by every single thing she had to say , which was quite a change from most of the guys she dated ."
"they were usually half listening to her while glancing over her shoulder at the tv to get the latest score ."
"after they finished , the waiter took their plates ."
"`` dessert ? ''"
"megan asked , as she downed the last of her wine ."
"pesh nodded his head toward the small dance floor ."
"`` how about a dance instead ? ''"
"she wrinkled her nose ."
"`` i 'm really not much of a dancer . ''"
"he arched his brows at her as if he knew she was lying ."
"`` okay , fine , i used to dance all the time back in high school and college . ''"
"`` then dance with me . ''"
"`` i 'm not good at slow dancing ."
"you 'll probably regret asking me the moment we get out there . ''"
"pesh stuffed a wad of bills into the bill envelope ."
"`` as shakespeare would say , the lady do protesth too much ."
"and i think i know the reason . ''"
"`` oh , you do ? ''"
"he nodded ."
"`` slow dancing is intimate , and you do n't want to want to let yourself be intimate with me . ''"
"`` you went down on me in a supply closet ."
"i think that 's pretty intimate , '' she challenged ."
"`` that was not intimacy ."
"sexual acts are of the mind where our pleasure center is ."
"intimacy is of the heart . ''"
"he held her gaze ."
"`` we both know you 'll let me into your body but not your heart . ''"
"knowing he was right , she crossed her arms over her chest and scowled at him ."
"she did n't know why she just could n't get up and go dance like he had asked ."
"she 'd slow danced a thousand times at parties ."
"what was the difference here ?"
"somewhere deep down , she knew the answer to that question ."
"`` if you do n't want to dance , then let 's go and see the city . ''"
"not wanting to let him get the best of her , she rose out of her chair ."
"`` fine ."
"i 'll dance with you . ''"
"he chuckled ."
"`` do n't sound so thrilled . ''"
"after he stood up , he took her hand and led her over to the dance floor ."
"she started to wrap her arms around his neck like she was accustomed to , but he put one of her hands on his shoulder and then he took the other hand in his ."
"his other hand slid around to rest at her lower back ."
"the band finished the jazzier beats of a song and then switched over to another ."
"a lone piano pounded out the opening chords ."
"the lead singer 's sultry voice filled the air , `` like a flower waiting to bloom . ''"
"megan immediately recognized the song as norah jones ' turn me on ."
"the electricity between them shifted , and as megan stared up into pesh 's eyes , she saw desire and lust flaring in them ."
"her gaze dropped down to his full lips , and she could n't help wanting him to kiss her ."
"as if he read her mind , pesh 's mouth closed over hers ."
"darting her tongue out , she sought to find his warmth ."
"when she did , he tasted like a mixture of the wine and spices they 'd eaten ."
"his tongue pulled back to trace her lips as his h*ps jerked , pushing him against her ."
"she followed his lead by pressing herself flush against him to where her br**sts were rubbing against his chest ."
"she shivered when he groaned into her mouth ."
"his thumb slid back and forth between her shoulder blades , and she could n't help arching into his touch ."
"as he pulled away from their kiss , he kept his eyes locked on hers ."
"she 'd never had a man stare at her so much ."
"it was like he was trying to see through her to her very soul ."
"it both overwhelmed and inflamed her at the same time ."
"it was all part of his slow seduction plan , and it was working ."
"`` please take me somewhere-somewhere we can be alone . ''"
"his expression became pained ."
"`` megan- '' she brought her hand from his shoulder to cover his lips ."
"`` do n't make me beg to be with you anymore . ''"
"shaking his head , he replied , `` i ca n't deny you anymore , not after having a taste of you . ''"
"megan shuddered at the intensity of both his words and the way he delivered them ."
"taking her by the hand , he led her off the dance floor ."
"they snaked around the tables in the dining area until they reached the exit ."
"weaving through the people , they went into the hotel that adjoined the restaurant ."
"it was actually more of a historic bed and breakfast than a hotel ."
"as they neared the reception area , pesh dropped her hand to reach into his coat pocket ."
"once he retrieved his wallet , he stepped up to the desk ."
"`` i need a room please . ''"
"`` credit card and identification please , '' the inn keeper droned ."
"as she sized him up , megan could n't help thinking he looked rather pompous-the usual type of person who worked in a high-end place ."
"`` would you prefer queen or- '' `` a king please , '' pesh requested through clenched teeth ."
"`` do you need help with your luggage ? ''"
"`` no , we do n't have any . ''"
"the man typed something into the computer ."
"`` and how long will you be staying with us ? ''"
"`` as long as we need , '' pesh replied , drumming his fingers on the marble counter ."
"megan watched as the man 's eyes widened and a flush entered his face ."
"he quickly finished the reservation and handed pesh a key card ."
"`` we have you in one of our balcony king suites . ''"
"`` thank you . ''"
"taking her by the hand , pesh led her over to the elevators ."
"when megan dared to glance over her shoulder , she saw the man peering curiously at them ."
"as they stepped onto the car , megan could n't help the nervous giggle that escaped her lips ."
"when pesh looked at her in surprise , she laughed even harder ."
"`` what is it ? ''"
"`` by the way that conversation went down , he probably thinks i 'm a prostitute . ''"
"pesh 's eyes widened ."
"`` you do n't seriously think that ? ''"
"`` okay , maybe a high-end escort ? ''"
"a growl came from low in his throat ."
"`` do not demean yourself like that . ''"
"`` i 'm not demeaning myself ."
"think about it ."
"we come in during the middle of the day with no luggage , and we want a hotel room with a king sized bed . ''"
"she tapped her chin with her finger ."
"`` hmm , what could we possibly be doing ? ''"
"the corners of his lips turned up in a smile ."
"`` i probably should care what the man thinks , but right now , i frankly do n't give a shit . ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` me either . ''"
"the elevator dinged , signaling they had reached their floor ."
"they stepped out and read the signs to find their room ."
"once pesh opened the door , megan walked inside ."
"she took in the cozy decor of the room with its brick fireplace , antiques , and four-poster bed ."
"going to a hotel could have been sleazy , but this room had such a romantic feel to it ."
"when he came up behind her and slid his arms around her waist , she could n't help suddenly feeling shy ."
"`` are you all right ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` i 'm fine . ''"
"his breath warmed against her ear ."
"`` you tensed when i touched you . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i did n't mean to ."
"i guess i 'm just nervous . ''"
"pesh turned her around to face him ."
"`` you do n't have anything to feel nervous about ."
"if you do n't want to do this anymore , we do n't have to . ''"
"`` no , i want to do it , '' she assured him ."
"without another word , his fingers went to her hair ."
"after he undid the clasp , her hair tumbled down over her shoulders ."
"an appreciative shudder rippled through her when he nuzzled his face into the strands at her neck ."
"from there he sought out the zipper at the middle of her back ."
"slowly , he slid it down ."
"when the back of the dress gaped open , he took the spaghetti straps and eased them over her shoulders and down her arms ."
"megan felt his breath warming her back as the dress pooled onto the floor ."
"she stepped out of it , and then turned to face him ."
"the heat of his gaze stoked the fire burning deep inside her ."
"his expression was fierce as he drank in her strapless black bra and panties , along with her heels ."
"`` you are so beautiful . ''"
"for some reason , she felt the urge to blush at his words ."
"guys had told her she was beautiful before , but it did n't feel the same or sound the same coming from them as it did pesh ."
"the way he said she was beautiful , coupled with the way he looked at her , made her tingle in all the right places ."
"her hands came to his tie ."
"after she loosened it , she ripped it off him and slung it to the floor ."
"deftly , her fingers worked the buttons on his shirt ."
"when she opened it , she sucked in a breath at the sight of the dusting of dark hair covering his chest ."
"it trailed down over his washboard abs and down into his pants ."
"`` you 're pretty beautiful yourself , '' she said with a smile ."
"as he shrugged off his shirt , her fingers went to his belt ."
"the entire time she unbuttoned and unzipped him , his burning gaze took in everything she did ."
"`` why do you keep staring at me ? ''"
"she questioned quietly ."
"`` i 'm afraid if i look away , you wo n't be real . ''"
"his hand cupped her cheek ."
"`` i 've wanted this for so long-i 've wanted you for so long ."
"it 's hard to believe that you 're really here . ''"
"`` touch me , '' she urged ."
"she took his other hand and brought it to her breast ."
"`` touch me and feel how real i am . ''"
"lowering his head , his mouth hovered over hers ."
"`` breathe me in , '' he instructed , as he kneaded her breast over her bra ."
"at the feel of his breath against her lips , she inhaled while his heated gaze almost singed her cheeks ."
"even if she had wanted to , she could n't bring herself to look away from his eyes ."
"when she exhaled , he inhaled , and it was like they were doing a dance ."
"it was both relaxing and somewhat erotic ."
"she 'd never spent time just breathing and gazing into someone 's eyes ."
"`` now you 've had your first lesson in tantra , '' he murmured against her lips ."
"she jerked her head back to stare at him in surprise ."
"`` are you going to do more ? ''"
"`` maybe . ''"
"he reached around to undo her bra ."
"`` do you want me to ? ''"
"`` i think so . ''"
"`` then i will ."
"i want to do whatever is pleasing for you . ''"
"she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him ."
"he eased her over to the four-poster bed ."
"after removing his pants and boxers , he slid her panties down her legs ."
"as megan sat on the edge of the massive king sized bed , she widened her legs to allow him to step between them ."
"when he brought his hand to stroke between her thighs , she moaned and let her head fall back ."
"two fingers entered her and began a slow , teasing assault ."
"she began to rock her h*ps against his hand , adding the friction she desired ."
"when she felt his erection rubbing against her leg , she reached between them to take him in her hand ."
"her eyelids fluttered open , and she stared into his face as they worked each other into a sweaty , panting frenzy ."
"when pesh curled his fingers inside her , she bit down on her lip to keep from screaming out in pleasure ."
"her orgasm rocketed through her lower half , causing her head to fall forward onto his chest ."
"when she came back to herself , pesh was sliding her body up the mattress ."
"then he was hovering over her , kissing her br**sts and licking her ni**les into hardened peaks ."
"`` now , pesh , '' she urged ."
"`` i want you deep inside of me . ''"
"just as his head nudged against her opening , he stopped ."
"`` oh no , '' he murmured before rocking back to sit on his knees ."
"megan propped herself up on her elbows and gazed up at him ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"she hoped that after giving in , he had n't decided to back out at the last minute ."
"he rubbed the stubble on his cheeks ."
"`` i , uh ... we ca n't do this without a condom , and i do n't have one with me . ''"
"`` oh , '' she murmured ."
"in the heat of the moment , she had totally forgotten about that ."
"`` you do n't happen to have one ? ''"
"he asked hopefully ."
"she shook her head ."
"`` sorry . ''"
"`` it 's me who ought to be sorry for putting you in a position like this without protection . ''"
"when he started to pull away , she sat up to grab his shoulders , urging him to stop ."
"`` we can still do this ."
"neither one of us has been with anybody in at least two years-we 've had tests for the hospital . ''"
"`` that 's all well and good but what about pregnancy ?"
"are you on the pill ? ''"
"`` no . ''"
"she chewed on her bottom lip momentarily ."
"`` wait a minute , '' she murmured ."
"in her mind , she began counting down the days since her last period ."
"`` twenty . ''"
"`` twenty what ? ''"
"`` i 'm on day twenty , so we should be safe . ''"
"`` i 'll still pull out . ''"
"`` if you say so , '' she replied ."
"gripping his biceps , she urged him to cover her again with his body ."
"she loved the feel of his chest hairs rubbing against her ni**les ."
"pesh widened her legs , and then he eased inside her , filling and stretching her walls ."
"it had been so long that she could n't help feeling a bit of a sting ."
"`` are you all right ? ''"
"`` i 'm fine . ''"
"he withdrew and flexed his hips , thrusting back inside her ."
"this time they both moaned ."
"setting up a rhythm , he began rocking in and out of her ."
"the pace was slow and sensual , and while he was hitting all the right spots , she wanted more ."
"the entire time he moved in and out of her , he kept his eyes locked firmly on hers ."
"his gaze was so dark with desire that she did n't dare look away ."
"the longer she stared into his eyes , the more connected with him she felt ."
"the old saying was that the eyes were windows to the soul , and she was getting a pretty good glimpse into his ."
"and that scared the hell out of her ."
"wanting to make things less sensual , she gripped his biceps ."
"`` harder , '' she panted ."
"rising on his knees , he slid his forearms under the backs of her knees ."
"this enabled him to pull her back against his pounding thrusts ."
"while their connection at first had been so intimate , this was more about lust and desire ."
"she reached up and clasped his face in her hands , bringing his head down to hers ."
"their mouths and tongues met in frenzied kisses ."
"when he pulled out of her , megan whimpered at the loss of feeling ."
"he quickly flipped her over onto her stomach ."
"pulling on her hips , he raised her up onto her knees ."
"when he reentered her , megan moaned ."
"with each thrust , he went deeper and deeper ."
"her fingers fisted the sheets as he leaned over her back , kissing a trail down her spine ."
"she did n't know how he was able to be so many places at once ."
"while his mouth licked her back and teasingly left love bites , his hands were rubbing her thighs and then sliding under her to squeeze her br**sts or tease her clit ."
"he was giving her so much that she could n't stay silent ."
"she moaned , chanted his name , and cried out as the sounds of their wet skin slapped together ."
"finally , she could n't take it anymore ."
"dropping her head , she screamed into the mattress as she found her release ."
"once her walls finished clenching , she felt pesh withdraw from her ."
"as he groaned , megan felt warmth spurt onto her back and bu**ocks ."
"after seeing him come before , she hated she could n't see his face ."
"he was so beautiful when he was finding release ."
"once he finished , she eased down onto her stomach and curled a pillow under her head ."
"after a few seconds , pesh lay down beside her ."
"she turned her head and met his gaze ."
"exhausted and completely sexually satisfied for the first time in her life , all she could muster to say was , `` wow . ''"
"a slow grin spread across his cheeks ."
"`` you seem to say that a lot around me after orgasms . ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` it 's because you render me absolutely speechless with your talents . ''"
"`` thank you ."
"i could say the same about you . ''"
"his gaze left her face and trailed down her na**d back ."
"`` we need to get you cleaned up . ''"
"rolling her shoulder blades , she said , `` i kinda like it ."
"makes me feel marked or something . ''"
"he smiled shyly at her ."
"`` i like the idea of marking you-making you mine . ''"
"he wanted her to be his ."
"she did n't know quite what to think about that statement ."
"did she want to be his ?"
"she certainly could n't imagine belonging to anyone else ."
"besides the amazing physical chemistry they shared , she was starting to feel such a deep connection to him ."
"staring over at him , she could n't help wondering what was going on in his mind ."
"`` we 've really done it now , have n't we ? ''"
"`` yes , i do believe that was the universal `` it '' that we just did , '' he teased ."
"she smacked his arm playfully ."
"`` that 's not what i meant . ''"
"`` i know , '' he murmured ."
"`` no matter what , this changes everything . ''"
"`` for the better , i hope . ''"
"`` i suppose . ''"
"the truth was she 'd never really had casual sex before ."
"there was one time her freshman year that she hooked up with a guy at work ."
"it was the first and only time she 'd ever done anything so crazy ."
"in that instance , the sex had been over before she 'd known it and without her coming even once ."
"after that fiasco , she had never wanted a repeat performance with him or any other random guy , until she 'd found herself in a sex slump after mason 's birth ."
"but with pesh , the sex had been ... she shivered as the remaining echoes washed over her ."
"before sleeping with pesh , she could count the number of past sexual partners on one hand , as well as the times she had had even remotely good sex ."
"for megan , her experience with pesh was seriously earth shattering and life altering ."
"she could n't imagine just walking away now ."
"pesh sat up and edged to the side of the bed ."
"he held out his hand to her ."
"`` come on ."
"let 's shower . ''"
"`` if you insist . ''"
"she slid over to him before throwing a leg over the side of the mattress ."
"although she should have felt a little bashful being na**d in front of him , she felt surprisingly comfortable ."
"when she got into the bathroom , she raised her brows in surprise ."
"`` a clawfoot tub ? ''"
"she questioned ."
"pesh laughed ."
"`` all the old charm but modern conveniences . ''"
"he pointed to the detachable shower head ."
"`` nice . ''"
"he turned on the water and waited for it to heat up ."
"once he decided it was warm enough , he took her by the hand and helped her inside ."
"she turned her back to the spray , letting the water clean her up ."
"pesh did n't seem to think that was enough because after he soaped up his hands , he began to wash off her back and ass ."
"as his magic hands massaged in slow strokes , she could n't resist asking the question that was plaguing her ."
"`` did i feel different ? ''"
"his hands stilled on her lower back ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"glancing at him over her shoulder , she replied , `` that was the first time i 've had sex since i gave birth to mason ."
"i just wondered if i felt different ."
"you know , inside . ''"
"his face came to nuzzle her neck ."
"`` you felt amazing . ''"
"`` not any different ? ''"
"`` did you hear me complaining ? ''"
"`` no , but i just worried . ''"
"`` you have nothing to worry about , my love . ''"
"his hand skimmed over her ribcage to cup her breast ."
"as her nipple hardened beneath his fingers , she sucked in a pleased breath ."
"`` i want nothing more than to be back inside you as soon as i can . ''"
"`` then why do n't you ? ''"
"she challenged ."
"`` fine then ."
"put your hands on the tile , '' he ordered ."
"`` yes , sir , '' she teased before placing her palms on the cool , wet tile ."
"pesh slid the gleaming silver shower head between her legs , causing her to gasp at the contact ."
"then he flicked his wrist to the side , sending the jets of water pounding into her clit ."
"she moaned and threw her head back against his drenched chest ."
"slowly he started moving the shower head to where it would rub against her ."
"each time she moved back , the water hit her in just the right spot ."
"she arched her h*ps as the pressure began to build ."
"pesh slid his free hand up over her ribcage to cup her breast ."
"he kneaded the flesh , pinching the ni**les that were already hardened ."
"she pinched her eyes shut from the sensory overload ."
"just as she would feel herself about to come , he would shift his wrist so the vibrations hit her in another area , building her again ."
"`` please , pesh , '' she moaned ."
"`` what , baby ? ''"
"`` please make me come . ''"
"`` have you had enough pleasure yet , or should we continue on ? ''"
"he asked , moving the shower head away from her ."
"she groaned at the loss ."
"rubbing her ass against his hardened erection , she begged , `` you let me come , and then i 'll make sure you do as well . ''"
"with his knee , he nudged her legs even further apart ."
"when he once again brought the shower head between her legs , it reached even more sensitive areas ."
"it took only a few seconds of the water coupled with his rubbing and her grinding to cause her to scream with the pulsing convulsions ."
"she smacked her hands against the walls as wave after wave pulsed through her ."
"when she finally stopped shuddering , she slowly slid around to smile up at pesh ."
"`` wow ? ''"
"he said , with a smile ."
"she teasingly pinched his arm ."
"`` i was going to say exquisitely amazing . ''"
"`` i 'm sure you were . ''"
"reaching between them , she took his erection in her hands ."
"`` good thing i 'm about to get on my knees because i do n't think i could stand after all that , '' she said , with a teasing wink ."
"bending her head , she began trailing kisses down his wet chest ."
"as she stroked him , she took time to kiss and then suck on his ni**les ."
"his groan told her she was finding some of his most sensitive places ."
"after teasing his ni**les to erect points , she continued on down his delicious washboard abs and through the dark hair that crowned his erection ."
"sinking down onto the floor of the tub , she stroked him hard from base to tip ."
"when his chest began to heave , she leaned over to slide him into her mouth ."
"`` megan , '' he groaned , his fingers coming to tangle in the wet strands of her hair ."
"she took him as far back as she could before sliding him out ."
"her tongue flicked over the sensitive head before she suctioned it ."
"when she released him again , she began long licks up his length ."
"then she once again slid him in her mouth and began bobbing her head up and down his length ."
"his groans began to echo throughout the bathroom ."
"`` oh , megan , '' pesh murmured ."
"his grip on her hair tightened as he flexed his h*ps to go even deeper into her mouth ."
"when he started tightening up , he tried to pull away , but she gripped his thighs and held him in place ."
"he cried out and then came in a rush into her mouth ."
"she swallowed all of him before she glanced up to see him staring down at her with such adoration in his face ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"as he fell free from her mouth , she smiled ."
"`` you 're welcome . ''"
"he helped her up off the tub floor ."
"`` we better hurry up before we use all the hot water in these old pipes . ''"
"`` i think you would probably do a good job keeping me warm . ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` i feel the same way about you . ''"
"although they were tempted for another round , megan knew pesh did n't want to chance it without any condoms ."
"instead , she tore herself away from him when they finished their shower ."
"she blew her hair dry while he got dressed ."
"once she finished , he helped her slide back into her dress ."
"then they left their suite without even turning down the bed ."
"when they got downstairs , megan inwardly groaned that the same man was at the reception desk ."
"she knew from his expression that he recognized them as well ."
"as pesh handed him the key card , megan decided to make the most of the situation ."
"she rubbed pesh 's arm ."
"`` thanks again , mr. nadeen ."
"make sure to call me again next time you 're in savannah ."
"i love big spenders like you , '' she purred ."
"while the man 's eyes bulged , pesh stared at megan like she had grown another head ."
"his mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water , but no words of admonishment came out ."
"when he finally , recovered , he tersely replied , `` i 'll try to remember that , miss mckenzie . ''"
"truly playing her part , megan turned on her heels and started walking across the lobby ."
"she did n't get far before pesh was at her side ."
"after shoving the hotel bill into his suit pocket , he slid his arm around her waist , drawing her close against him ."
"`` you are in so much trouble , '' he growled into her ear ."
"she giggled as they walked out of the hotel ."
"`` mmm , are you going to punish me by taking me over your knee and spanking me ? ''"
"`` i just might , '' he replied ."
"tilting her head , she eyed him in the street lights ."
"`` you ca n't seriously expect me to believe that you of all people are into bdsm ? ''"
"`` no , i 'm not . ''"
"she snorted ."
"`` once again , that does n't surprise me . ''"
"when he stopped walking right in the middle of the crowded street , she stared up at him in surprise ."
"`` a good spanking , some handcuffs , and a blindfold all have possibilities ."
"as far as all that other stuff ? ''"
"his thumb came up to trail slowly across her bottom lip ."
"`` if one truly knows how to f**k , you do n't need any accessories and embellishments . ''"
"she licked her lips as a little shiver went down her spine ."
"`` and you certainly know what you 're doing ."
"you just got me wet right here in the middle of the street . ''"
"his jaw clenched as he took her by the arm ."
"`` do n't say anything else like that ."
"i need to get you home . ''"
"`` to your bed ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` i wish ."
"but you need to go home to your family . ''"
"megan did n't argue with him because she knew he was right ."
"she had a son to think about ."
"regardless of how tempting it was , she just could n't go on some pleasure binge when she was a mother ."
"but there was a part of megan that did n't want the bubble to burst by leaving pesh and going home to her regular life ."
"she wanted nothing more than go back to his place ."
"sex with pesh had been phenomenal ."
"and despite being a little sore from underuse , she certainly felt ready for more ."
"sex , that was ."
"pesh grabbed them a taxi , and they made the drive back to the airport ."
"even though they did n't speak , megan did n't feel awkward around him after what they had done ."
"he sat as close to her as he could with her hand clasped in his ."
"once they got back to the plane , she felt exhaustion begin to set in ."
"leaning back against the headrest , she closed her eyes as pesh went about getting them ready to take off ."
"she only opened her eyes again when she felt them start racing down the runway ."
"when they got into the air , she could n't help sitting on the edge of her seat and peering out the windows at the city lights ."
"`` it 's so beautiful in the dark . ''"
"`` sometimes i think i favor flying at night . ''"
"`` you do ? ''"
"he nodded ."
"`` for some reason , it seems much more tranquil ."
"there 's a vulnerability to it as well ."
"in the day , everything is within your sight distance ."
"but in the dark , you have to rely on your instruments and instincts . ''"
"`` i 'd love to learn how to fly . ''"
"`` you would ? ''"
"she nodded ."
"`` i 've always thought it would be something amazing to learn . ''"
"`` then i 'll teach you . ''"
"she turned to him in surprise ."
"`` really ? ''"
"`` sure ."
"why not ? ''"
"with a shrug , she replied , `` you 're a busy man , and i do n't know how fast a learner i would be . ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` for you i would make time . ''"
"as she stared at him across the small interior of the plane , she knew she was ready to make more time for him as well ."
"where it would lead them , she could n't wait to see ."
"chapter fifteen as the cornflower-blue horizon spread out for miles and miles before her , megan could n't help fighting the urge to pinch herself ."
"she was actually up in pesh 's plane during her first flight lesson ."
"from the moment they had taken off , she had been overwhelmed by such a surreal feeling ."
"it must 've been something about being in control of the plane as it rocketed down the runway and then took off into the sky ."
"of course , she really was n't in total control of the plane ."
"pesh was able to take over at any moment from his spot in the co-pilot 's seat ."
"that made her feel a little better considering she had so little flying experience , and the manual she had read at least twice did n't prepare you for everything ."
"now as they coasted along the city skyline , she kept both hands firmly gripping the steering wheel , or yoke as it was called in small plane terminology , as they passed through wispy strands of white clouds ."
"when pesh had first offered to give her flying lessons , megan did n't know if she should believe him or not ."
"looking back , she was n't sure why she ever doubted him considering he was always a man of his word ."
"and now , just two weeks after their first date in savannah , they were back up in the air flying around atlanta on a thursday afternoon ."
"it had been quite a week together of having dinner after work or them picking up something on the way to her house ."
"although , the first day back at work proved both difficult and awkward as they tried to appear as though nothing had changed ."
"but the fact was everything had changed , and it was n't just because they had become physical ."
"as much as megan tried to fight her growing feelings for pesh , it was virtually impossible ."
"a man like him made it too hard for any woman not to fall in love with him , and as much as she did n't want to acknowledge it , she could see herself falling for him ."
"of course , he was also full of surprises ."
"like on monday when he had asked her to see if there was an extra heart monitor in one of the empty patient rooms on the first floor ."
"she had obediently gone to check ."
"while she found the heart monitor , she also found him ."
"the gentleman she had once known became somewhat of a sex fiend when he locked the door and disappeared with her behind the curtain ."
"a mid-day sex session in an empty hospital bed made for quite an experience , especially when the brake on the bed released , and they literally banged into the walls ."
"but besides the naughty sexcapade , he 'd wanted to spend down time with her and mason ."
"earlier in the week , pesh brought mason to see his plane ."
"megan had to smile at the image in her mind of mason on pesh 's lap in the pilot 's seat as he explained the ins and outs of the buttons and knobs ."
"pesh had shown such patience with mason by constantly fielding his questions and letting him wear one of the headsets ."
"he 'd even gotten the atc to send a message over the headset so mason could hear ."
"while it was supposed to be a pre-flying lesson for her , it turned educational for mason as well ."
"and to make it a day that neither mason , nor pesh would forget , they 'd gone by mcdonald 's afterwards so mason could play on the playground ."
"the fact that pesh was so willing to do anything to make mason happy was slowly starting to crack megan 's tough resolve against dating him ."
"it was n't just the fact that pesh was so wonderful with mason that had her reeling ."
"when they talked , she shared more with him than she ever had with a man ."
"he made it easy to open up to and speak of both the good and the bad in her life ."
"he was such a good listener that she never felt like she was just rattling on and boring him ."
"he truly seemed interested in everything she said ."
"it was an amazing feeling ."
"`` still doing okay over there ? ''"
"pesh asked , bringing her out of her thoughts ."
"she grinned ."
"`` fine . ''"
"`` i wish you could see your face , '' he mused ."
"`` do i have some dopey expression ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` it is n't dopey ."
"it 's wide-eyed wonderment like a kid on christmas morning . ''"
"`` oh , i would totally believe it since this certainly feels like a very big and very dangerous toy . ''"
"`` it 's a wonderful sight to see ."
"i 'm so glad i get to share this with you . ''"
"he took one of her hands from the yoke and brought it to his mouth ."
"as his lips kissed over her knuckles , she tensed ."
"`` i need my hand back ."
"i do n't feel like i have a good grip on the steering wheel like you said i should , '' she protested ."
"pesh sighed and released her hand ."
"`` how i regret telling you that tip now , '' he lamented ."
"she smiled ."
"`` that 's not fair to try and distract me ."
"i need to focus , so we do n't crash . ''"
"`` all right ."
"i 'll keep my hands to myself ... for now . ''"
"a shudder went through her at his words ."
"at that moment if there was any way possible to actually fly the plane and bang him , she would have tried ."
"shaking her head , she tried ridding herself of her inappropriate thoughts ."
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"she asked , pointing at a dark blip far down on the horizon ."
"pesh leaned forward in his seat , peering out the windshield ."
"`` looks like a storm cloud moving in . ''"
"`` we should head back then . ''"
"he chuckled ."
"`` i do n't think it 's going to affect us . ''"
"`` yeah , well , i do n't like the thought of trying to fly in a storm . ''"
"`` then we 'll head back . ''"
"`` which way should i turn the plane ? ''"
"`` let 's take a right , '' pesh replied ."
"megan bobbed her head and then turned the yoke at the same time she pressed on the right rudder pedal with her foot ."
"`` good ."
"keep it coming ."
"we 're almost turned around . ''"
"once they were facing the opposite direction , pesh said , `` now let 's bring up the speed . ''"
"she did as she was told and waited for him to give her any further instructions ."
"`` we 're good to go now ."
"when we 're about ten minutes out from mccollum , you need to let the atc know we 're coming in . ''"
"`` okay ."
"i can do that . ''"
"`` do you have plans for this evening ? ''"
"`` not that i know of . ''"
"`` would you like to have dinner with me ? ''"
"she nibbled on her bottom lip to keep from laughing at his formalness ."
"`` i suppose so ."
"do i get dessert afterwards ? ''"
"his body tensed beside her ."
"`` are you implying that i 'm dessert , or that after we finish dinner i should get you dessert ? ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` no , i want you for dessert . ''"
"`` then you can have me ."
"always . ''"
"glancing over at him , she said , `` i might have to ask for a to-go box since i 'm assuming we 'll have mason with us . ''"
"`` i do n't mind ."
"i enjoy spending time with him . ''"
"megan could n't keep the smile off her face at pesh 's words ."
"`` he really likes being with you , too ."
"i 've never seen him warm up to a stranger as much as he has to you . ''"
"`` i 'm a likeable guy , '' he teased ."
"`` yeah , you are , '' she murmured , trying not to let the out-of-control fluttering of her heart make her think more than she should about him ."
"pesh interrupted her thoughts by motioning to the controls ."
"`` go ahead and start doing your landing checks . ''"
"megan vaguely remembered what knobs and meters she had looked at before they took off ."
"once she got through the landing checks with pesh 's help , they were getting closer to mccollum ."
"`` now radio atc . ''"
"`` um , okay , '' megan replied , nibbling on her lip ."
"after clearing his throat , megan glanced over at pesh ."
"he motioned to the yoke ."
"`` oh , duh , '' she replied ."
"with her thumb , she pressed the push-to-talk button ."
"`` this is cessna 172 coming in for landing . ''"
"before she could ask pesh if she had done it right , he relayed a different message over his push-to-talk ."
"the atc 's response crackled over her headset ."
"`` cessna 172 , this is ground control confirming you are clear to land . ''"
"`` now push on the yoke to start the descent , '' pesh instructed ."
"after she did what she was told , her eyes locked on the speedometer ."
"`` should we be picking up this much speed ? ''"
"`` yes and no , '' pesh replied ."
"`` what the hell does that mean ? ''"
"she asked , jerking her wild gaze to his ."
"he chuckled ."
"`` see the black knob there labeled 'throttle ' ? ''"
"`` yeah . ''"
"`` look at it this way ."
"you know when you 're in a car and you 're going downhill , you pick up speed ? ''"
"megan nodded ."
"`` it 's the same thing in a plane ."
"but if you pull on the throttle knob , it reduces the engine power so there wo n't be an increase in speed . ''"
"with her fingers grasping the black knob , megan asked , `` how hard do i need to pull on it ? ''"
"`` try pulling back half-way . ''"
"after pulling on the knob , megan eyed the speed ."
"`` we 're slowing down . ''"
"`` good . ''"
"`` are we at ninety knots ? ''"
"megan glanced down ."
"`` yeah . ''"
"`` okay , then lower the nose just a little bit ."
"that will give us a glide-path or a controlled descent . ''"
"megan eased on the steering wheel until the nose of the plane dipped below the horizon ."
"`` now put the landing gear in the down position , '' pesh instructed ."
"`` is that the button with the little tire on it ? ''"
"`` yep , that 's the one . ''"
"megan pressed it ."
"`` got it . ''"
"`` using the steering wheel , roll the wings a little to the right , so we 're lined back up with the runway . ''"
"megan turned the steering wheel to the right a little too abruptly ."
"`` oops , '' she replied ."
"`` it 's okay ."
"just level it out ."
"you always want your runway target spot to stay in the same fixed spot on the windshield . ''"
"as megan stared ahead , she realized how close they were getting to the runway , and in turn , the ground ."
"suddenly she was n't so sure if she could land the plane ."
"it was one thing taking off , but it seemed like there was so much more that could go wrong when landing ."
"`` u-uh , p-pesh , '' she stammered ."
"`` yeah ? ''"
"he asked casually ."
"`` i do n't think i can do this . ''"
"she cut her eyes over to him ."
"`` i ca n't land the plane ."
"it 's too scary . ''"
"`` yes , you can . ''"
"megan shook her head furiously back and forth ."
"`` no really ."
"you need to take back the controls ."
"i could cause us to crash . ''"
"`` but i have faith in you . ''"
"`` really ? ''"
"`` of course ."
"i would n't let you do this if i did n't think you could . ''"
"she stole a glance at him , taking in his earnest expression ."
"god , he really and truly believed in her ."
"and it was n't just about the fact they were banging each other every chance they got alone ."
"no , he saw through to the real her ."
"after taking a deep breath , she felt herself slowly calming down ."
"`` fine ."
"i 'll try , but i 'm not making any promises . ''"
"`` that 's my girl , '' pesh replied ."
"`` what should i do now ? ''"
"`` all right , now you need to pull the throttle all the way out as well as pulling back on the wheel to keep the nose from dipping . ''"
"clearing her throat that felt as dry as sandpaper , megan jerked on the throttle button before pulling on the steering wheel ."
"it was a little harder considering how sweaty her hands were ."
"`` keep it steady ."
"you 're doing great . ''"
"as they came closer and closer to the runway , megan fought the urge to close her eyes , but she realized that would not be the right thing to do ."
"instead , she braced herself for the impact ."
"the moment the wheels hit the asphalt she shrieked and clutched at the steering wheel ."
"`` do n't fight the bounce ."
"we 're fine ."
"you 're fine . ''"
"they skidded along the pavement ."
"`` okay , now ease up on the wheel and push on the tops of both pedals to apply the brakes . ''"
"without thinking , megan stomped her feet , causing the plane to screech ."
"`` easy , '' pesh said ."
"she let her feet off the brakes , and they began to coast ."
"`` now you 're going to bring it back into the hanger . ''"
"`` oh , hell no !"
"i would end up mowing out the side of the building or another plane ! ''"
"megan cried ."
"pesh 's amused chuckle died quickly at the death glare she shot him ."
"`` megan , you 'll do fine ."
"you just landed a plane ."
"i think you can handle pulling into a hanger . ''"
"she scowled at him ."
"`` fine ."
"but when you have to file a huge insurance claim , i 'm going to say 'i told you so . '"
"''"
"`` we 'll see , '' he replied ."
"she could tell he was fighting back a smile the way he kept biting down on his lip ."
"`` all right , take a right here , '' he said , pointing to where the runaway split ."
"she turned the wheel to the right and began easing her foot down on the brake when she saw the hangers come into view ."
"`` which one is yours ? ''"
"`` i share the third one ."
"luckily for you , it 's pretty much a straight shot in ."
"just watch out for my dad 's plane . ''"
"megan jerked her horrified gaze over to his ."
"`` i could be taking out your dad 's plane ? ''"
"pesh shook his head ."
"`` you 're not going to take out anyone 's plane , megan ."
"i have faith in you . ''"
"she gripped the steering wheel until her knuckles turned white ."
"after taking a deep breath and giving herself a mental pep talk , she started slowly easing the plane inside the hanger ."
"even though she was far away from the back wall , she hit the brakes ."
"`` is this okay ? ''"
"`` looks good to me ."
"now you want to pull on the red knob . ''"
"`` the one that says mixture ? ''"
"`` yeah , that 's the one ."
"it will kill the engine . ''"
"when megan pulled on the knob , the plane shuddered into silence ."
"she could n't help sitting absolutely frozen for a few moments , processing everything that had happened ."
"pesh 's hand reached out to rub her shoulder ."
"`` you okay over there ? ''"
"he asked ."
"turning her head , she smiled ."
"`` i think so . ''"
"`` you were starting to worry me for a minute . ''"
"`` i think i was worrying myself . ''"
"pesh 's warm laugh made her tingle in parts it should n't ."
"with the adrenaline depleting from her system , she knew exactly what she wanted to do ."
"or maybe the more appropriate word was who she wanted to do ."
"frantically , she unbuttoned her seat belt and dove over into his lap ."
"`` megan , what in the hell are you doing ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"her response to his question was to kiss him ."
"greedily her mouth devoured his lips ."
"as her tongue thrust into his mouth , her hand went between them to cup his growing erection ."
"he groaned while she worked him over his pants ."
"when she rose up on her knees to get a better grip of him , she banged her head against the ceiling of the plane ."
"`` shit ! ''"
"`` are you all right ? ''"
"he asked , bringing his hands up to cup her now aching head ."
"`` i 'm fine . ''"
"he snickered ."
"`` the last thing you need is a concussion ."
"how would we explain that one ? ''"
"megan giggled ."
"`` maybe turbulence during the flight ? ''"
"`` you 're the one creating turbulence , '' he replied , a wicked gleam in his eyes ."
"`` how are we going to do this ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` backseat , '' he replied ."
"with a nod , she began climbing over him into the small two seats in the back ."
"as pesh unbuckled his seat belt , megan 's fingers furiously worked to get her jeans unzipped and unbuttoned ."
"she was easing them down her thighs when his body came over hers ."
"she once again claimed his mouth as pesh worked to get his own pants down ."
"`` pocket ."
"condom , '' he murmured against her lips ."
"she nodded and then reached her hand down to dig out the foil wrapper ."
"during high school , she gotten used to ha**ng s*x in cars , but this was taking it to a whole new level ."
"somehow without being able to see him in the small confines of the plane 's backseat , she rolled the condom down pesh 's length ."
"when she felt his hardness pressing against her core , she widened her legs as far as she could in the cramped quarters ."
"with one quick thrust , he was buried deep inside her ."
"she gripped his shoulders , pushing against him to keep from knocking back into the seat ."
"considering where they were , there was no time for soft and sweet ."
"instead , the sounds in the air were of skin slapping together as pesh 's movements were frantic against her ."
"she loved every delicious minute of it , and it was n't too long before she felt herself going over the edge ."
"her nails raked over his back as she screamed his name ."
"with her walls milking pesh 's erection , he came with a shout , crushing her body with his ."
"just when she thought she could n't breathe , he jerked back ."
"`` are you okay ? ''"
"`` i 'm fine , '' she replied ."
"she cupped his cheek ."
"`` really good now , thanks to you . ''"
"he gave her the shy smile of his that warmed her all over ."
"`` i 'm glad to hear that . ''"
"`` um , dr ."
"nadeen ? ''"
"someone called outside the plane ."
"`` oh shit , '' he muttered , as he slid out of her body ."
"as he went about ridding himself of the condom and jerking his pants up , he called , `` yeah , trace ? ''"
"`` i was just concerned about you considering you landed a few minutes ago and had n't deplaned ."
"and then there was a lot of knocking going on inside the plane . ''"
"megan 's hand flew over her mouth as she started giggling uncontrollably ."
"it probably did n't help that as trace was talking , she had noticed that the windows of the plane were fogged up ."
"`` i appreciate your concern , trace ."
"i was just checking on some post-flight issues ."
"i 'll be out in just a moment . ''"
"as pesh finished and climbed into the front seat , megan hurried to get her jeans up ."
"once she had them buttoned and zipped , she smoothed down her hair that had to look like she had just been f**ked against an airplane seat ."
"she slid into the passenger seat to find that pesh had opened the driver 's side and was talking to trace ."
"trace 's gaze left pesh 's and came to hers ."
"it took only a few seconds for him to put two and two together of what had actually been going on ."
"he slowly started backing away from the plane ."
"`` yeah , well , you two have a nice day then , '' he said ."
"`` same to you , '' megan called , trying not to start giggling again ."
"pesh shook his head as he hopped down out of the plane ."
"`` come on ."
"let 's go before we get in any more trouble . ''"
"`` but getting in trouble is so much fun , '' megan protested , as she opened her door ."
"he grinned at her as he came around to meet her ."
"`` you , my lovely , are a very bad influence . ''"
"he wrapped his arms around her waist , drawing her close to him ."
"`` but i 'm grateful for every moment i have with you . ''"
"`` mmm , you know just how to flatter a girl , '' she said , before kissing him ."
"after a few heated moments , pesh pulled away ."
"`` considering this hanger has security cameras , let 's not totally give them all our secrets today . ''"
"megan squealed and covered her mouth ."
"`` did they ... can they ... ? ''"
"`` not inside the backseat . ''"
"she exhaled with relief ."
"`` thank goodness . ''"
"he laughed ."
"`` come on , little troublemaker ."
"let 's go get something to eat . ''"
"`` sounds good to me . ''"
"with a wink , she added , `` especially if there 's dessert ! ''"
"chapter sixteen a few days after her flying adventure and partial induction in the mile high club , megan had started to take a few scripts to the pharmacy when she was yanked by the arm and dragged into an examining room ."
"`` what the ? ''"
"she began , as the door was slammed behind her ."
"instead of pesh before her , it was kristi ."
"`` i need to have a word with you . ''"
"anxiety bubbled in megan 's chest , and she had to take a few deep breaths before she could speak ."
"`` have i done something wrong with a patient ? ''"
"kristi shook her head ."
"`` oh no , this has everything to do with dr ."
"nadeen . ''"
"megan 's brows shot up in surprise ."
"`` pesh ?"
"what 's wrong with him ? ''"
"`` it 's not what is wrong with him ."
"it 's what is wrong with you . ''"
"megan gulped ."
"`` me ? ''"
"kristi nodded ."
"`` i really like you , megan , but i am worried that you are just playing him ."
"it is cruel ."
"he does n't deserve it . ''"
"`` i do n't know what you mean . ''"
"`` please do n't play coy ."
"not only do i have two daughters around your age , but i 've spent enough time working with women to have a pretty good insight into the female mind ."
"so , i 'll ask once again , what are you doing ? ''"
"megan squirmed under the heat of kristi 's stare ."
"if anyone found out that she and pesh were hooking up , it could be very bad for her nursing career ."
"`` we 're friends ."
"he 's my cousin 's godfather . ''"
"kristi rolled her eyes ."
"`` fine ."
"let me speak as freely as i can since you insist on playing dumb ."
"i do n't give two shits if you and pesh are screwing all over this hospital- '' megan was unable to contain her loud gasp ."
"`` excuse me , but i- '' now it was kristi 's turn to interrupt ."
"she held up her hands ."
"`` let me finish please . ''"
"`` fine , '' megan muttered ."
"`` i realize that deep down he 's just a man , and after going a long time without sex , it was probably a little easier for him to give in to just a causal relationship with you ."
"but i 've worked by his side for seven years , so i have a pretty good handle on what he 's truly feeling . ''"
"`` oh really ? ''"
"megan countered , unable to stop herself from being snarky ."
"`` yes , i do ."
"that man loves you with every fiber of his being . ''"
"those words caused megan 's steely resolve to fade ."
"she could n't help staggering a bit on her feet ."
"she knew that pesh liked her-i mean , any fool could see that ."
"but love ?"
"`` h-he does ? ''"
"`` oh yeah , he does ."
"he 's been holding a candle for you since the moment you walked in here ."
"i saw it the first day i introduced you two ."
"i do n't know what has happened since that day , but i know something has changed for you , too . ''"
"`` it 's true that i care about him ."
"he 's the most amazing man i 've ever known . ''"
"`` then what the hell is the problem ? ''"
"`` i wish i could tell you , but i do n't even know myself , '' megan moaned as tears stung her eyes ."
"`` dammit , stupid pms hormones . ''"
"`` oh honey , you do actually care about him , do n't you ? ''"
"`` yes , '' she whispered ."
"`` and you 're a wreck about what you 're feeling for him , are n't you ? ''"
"kristi asked ."
"megan could n't hold back the sobs any longer ."
"they rolled through her , causing her to bend at the waist under the burden ."
"kristi stepped forward , wrapping her arms around megan ."
"even though she knew she should try to fight her emotions considering she was at work , she decided to let herself go and get it all out ."
"when she finally had a hold of herself , she raised her head , wiping what she imagined were the hideous black mascara streaks off her face ."
"`` i 'm so sorry ."
"that was so unprofessional of me . ''"
"kristi gave her a sad smile ."
"`` would you stop that , please ?"
"this is n't an evaluation ."
"besides , i 'm the one who pulled you in here and provoked you ."
"you always keep your emotions in check out on the floor . ''"
"`` the truth is i do care for pesh ."
"how could i not ?"
"i 'm just not sure i 'm the right woman for him . ''"
"`` but if he loves you , how could you think you 're not the right one ? ''"
"megan blurted out all the reasons she 'd previously given pesh about her age and her lack of wanting a committed relationship ."
"when she finally finished unburdening herself of all her doubts and fears , she glanced up at kristi ."
"there was no judgment in her eyes or anger for that matter ."
"instead , she merely patted megan 's cheek ."
"`` oh honey , you 've got to tune all those negative voices out and go with your heart . ''"
"megan shook head ."
"`` but what if i do n't know what my heart is telling me to do ? ''"
"`` you will ."
"just give it time . ''"
"kristi patted her back ."
"`` why do n't you go get cleaned up and then take your lunch break ? ''"
"`` no , i need to make up for the time i 've missed . ''"
"`` you 're fine . ''"
"she motioned to the door ."
"`` go on ."
"see if dr. nadeen is on his way to lunch so you can join him . ''"
"`` but i should n't ."
"it wo n't look right if we 're alone together . ''"
"kristi chuckled ."
"`` alone together in a crowded hospital cafeteria ?"
"i do n't think that 's possible . ''"
"megan nibbled on her bottom lip and fought the urge to argue with kristi ."
"after all , if the very woman who was in charge of her clinical grade did n't give a shit about her and pesh being seen together , why should she ?"
"finally , she just gave a defeated sigh ."
"`` okay , i 'll go see . ''"
"`` good girl ."
"and you be listening to your heart now ."
"okay ? ''"
"`` i 'll try ."
"i promise . ''"
"although she spoke the words with such conviction of character , megan was afraid it was going to be harder than she thought ."
"chapter seventeen when pesh arrived at work the following day , he found kristi alone in the nurses ' station ."
"gazing around , he asked , `` where 's megan ? ''"
"`` oh , she called in sick today . ''"
"both disappointment and concern filled him ."
"she had seemed a little off the night before when they had dinner together in the cafeteria ."
"she was quieter and somewhat withdrawn ."
"he had just chalked it up to the fact that they were sitting with some of the other staff and she was trying not to make things seem weird with them now ."
"he wondered if he should call her and check to make sure she was okay ."
"they were in such limbo together that even though it sounded like the right thing to do , he was n't sure ."
"with a resigned sigh , he decided to leave things as they were and vowed to check on her tomorrow when she returned to work ."
"as much as pesh hated to admit it , the day dragged mercilessly without megan ."
"he went from patient to patient with a monotony he had n't felt in a long time ."
"when his shift ended , he met kristi in the hallway ."
"`` want me to walk you out ? ''"
"he suggested ."
"`` thank you ."
"i 'd appreciate that . ''"
"`` it would be my pleasure . ''"
"they started out the mechanized doors to the employee parking lot ."
"to fill the quiet of their shoes echoing on the pavement , he said , `` i hated to hear that megan was n't feeling well . ''"
"`` so did i ."
"poor thing offered to pull a double tomorrow to make up for being gone . ''"
"kristi smiled ."
"`` she sure is going to make a fine nurse . ''"
"`` yes , she is . ''"
"`` you 've taken a special interest in her , have n't you ? ''"
"kristi asked ."
"pesh 's steps momentarily faltered , and he stumbled ."
"`` whatever do you mean ? ''"
"kristi chuckled ."
"`` you know exactly what i mean . ''"
"`` it is true that we know each other outside of the hospital , but when we 're in the er , our relationship is strictly professional . ''"
"`` i never said it was n't . ''"
"after gazing around the somewhat deserted parking lot , he shook his head ."
"`` what you 're alluding to between me and megan ?"
"nothing good can come of those types of rumors . ''"
"patting his arm , kristi smiled ."
"`` there are no rumors-merely an observation by someone who loves and admires you . ''"
"his brows rose in surprise ."
"`` you do n't disapprove ? ''"
"`` of course not ."
"i think it 's a good match for both you and her . ''"
"he remained silent for a few moments , contemplating her words ."
"`` perhaps i should call and check on her . ''"
"`` i think that would be a very good idea . ''"
"she took her keys out of her purse and motioned at the honda they were standing in front of ."
"`` well , this is me . ''"
"`` have a good night , kristi . ''"
"`` same to you , dr. nadeen ."
"and good luck . ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` thank you ."
"i appreciate that . ''"
"when he got to his car , he slid inside and took his phone out ."
"he scrolled through his contacts to find megan 's number ."
"after he dialed , he anxiously drummed his fingers on the steering wheel ."
"the call went to her voicemail , leaving him with a defeated feeling ."
"although he knew it probably was n't the best idea in the world , he decided to go to her house to check on her ."
"the moment he rang her parents ' doorbell he really regretted making a house call ."
"one of her younger brothers answered ."
"`` hey , what 's up ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` hello ."
"i 'm dr. nadeen ."
"i work with megan . ''"
"snapping his fingers , he pointed at pesh ."
"`` wait , i know you ."
"are n't you noah 's godfather ? ''"
"pesh smiled ."
"`` yes , i am . ''"
"`` cool ."
"listen man , megan 's downstairs ."
"if you go around the side of the house , she has her own door . ''"
"`` i see ."
"thank you then . ''"
"`` no problem . ''"
"when the door closed , pesh debated going straight to his car ."
"but he knew it would look even worse if her brother told her he had been there and then he had left without seeing her ."
"heaving a frustrated breath , he headed off the porch ."
"he followed the sidewalk around the house to where it sloped down the hill ."
"at the side door , he knocked loudly ."
"when the door flew open , megan stared at him in a mixture of both surprise and horror ."
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"pesh shoved his hands in his pockets ."
"`` you called in sick today ."
"i was worried . ''"
"`` i 'm fine . ''"
"he fought the urge to say that by her disheveled appearance and dark circles under her eyes , she most certainly did n't seem fine ."
"`` i tried calling you , but you did n't answer ."
"kristi and i were worried about you . ''"
"her expression softened a little ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i must 've forgotten to charge my phone . ''"
"`` can i get you something to eat ?"
"some soup maybe ? ''"
"`` really , i 'm fine . ''"
"`` but you look so pale ."
"will you let me do an exam ?"
"you know the flu is- '' `` i do n't have the flu . ''"
"`` how can you be sure if you have n't been checked ?"
"did you get the flu shot at the hospital ?"
"sometimes it can give you a mild case . ''"
"she shook her head and smiled ."
"`` i do n't have the flu ."
"since you 're going to keep on and on , i 'm going to go ahead and tell you ."
"i have really horrendous cramps with my period ."
"usually , i can manage them with birth control , but when i started clinicals and stopped working , i could n't afford the birth control without health insurance ."
"and it was n't like i was ha**ng s*x anyway . ''"
"while he appreciated her honesty , he was also slightly mortified ."
"`` oh , i see . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry to have embarrassed you , '' megan said ."
"he waved his hand dismissively ."
"`` listen , when you return to work tomorrow , there will be a script for you for birth control ."
"i do n't like the idea of you in pain , so i do n't want this to happen next month . ''"
"`` but the money , '' she protested ."
"he shook his head ."
"`` it will be discounted through the hospital pharmacy . ''"
"`` thank you , pesh ."
"that 's a very decent thing for you to do . ''"
"a blonde head peeked around megan ."
"`` hi esh ."
"you play ? ''"
"he smiled at mason ."
"`` i came to check on your mommy . ''"
"mason tilted his chin to look up at megan ."
"`` her tummy hurts ."
"she no play ."
"u play ? ''"
"`` um , well ... '' he wanted nothing more than to spend time with mason , and in the same token , with megan as well ."
"but he was also walking such a fine line with her that he did n't want to come on too strong and scare her off ."
"`` i 'm not sure your mommy feels up to company . ''"
"megan smiled ."
"`` if you really do n't mind staying , we 'd love to have you . ''"
"`` are you certain ? ''"
"`` sure . ''"
"`` okay then . ''"
"mason grabbed his hand and led him through the door ."
"pesh took in the cozy decor of the basement apartment ."
"in one chair , megan 's textbooks and papers were strewn around , while on the floor it looked like a tornado had blown through the living room with all the toys lying around ."
"when he met her gaze , she flushed ."
"`` sorry it 's such a mess . ''"
"`` it 's fine . ''"
"`` are you hungry ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` no , i 'm good , '' he lied , as his stomach rumbled ."
"megan cocked her head and shot him a look ."
"`` sit down and let me fix you something . ''"
"`` not with you feeling unwell . ''"
"`` although i wish i could cook you something , i think i 'm up to reheating some of the pizza we ordered today , or there are some homemade enchiladas i made last night , '' she replied , as she opened the fridge ."
"`` enchiladas would be lovely . ''"
"she smiled and took out a casserole dish ."
"`` you hungry , mace ? ''"
"`` mmm , hmm , '' he murmured , barely looking up at his mother from one of his toys ."
"after spooning out two heaping plates full , along with some rice , she put it in the microwave ."
"she then motioned for him to have a seat at the table ."
"`` you do n't need to wait on me . ''"
"`` just shut up and let me take care of you for two seconds . ''"
"her words reminded him of when she had cleaned his wounds after dev 's punch ."
"no matter what the situation , she was always ready to be there for him and take care of him ."
"the microwave beeped and brought him out of his thoughts ."
"mason hurried over to the table and sat down beside pesh in his booster seat ."
"when megan put down the steaming plates , he reached for her hand and kissed it ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"a funny look passed in her eyes before she smiled ."
"`` you 're welcome . ''"
"`` wo n't you sit with us ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` actually , i would love to take a warm bath ."
"you know , to see if it would help relax my muscles . ''"
"pesh smiled ."
"`` i 'll be happy to keep an eye on mason while you do that . ''"
"`` you do n't mind ? ''"
"`` of course i do n't . ''"
"`` thanks ."
"i really appreciate it . ''"
"she kissed the top of mason 's head , and then kissed his cheek ."
"she turned to start into the bedroom before whirling back around ."
"he lowered his fork at the expression on her face ."
"placing her hands on his cheeks , she leaned in and laid a big one on him ."
"he could n't hide his surprise ."
"when she pulled away , she grinned at his speechlessness ."
"`` i wo n't be long , '' she said ."
"once the bedroom door closed behind her , pesh gazed over at mason ."
"`` what do you want to do when we finish eating ? ''"
"`` minions , '' he mumbled through a mouthful of food ."
"pesh furrowed his brows in confusion ."
"`` what 's minions ? ''"
"hopping down off his chair , mason ran over to the tv ."
"when he returned , he had a dvd box in his hand ."
"he pointed to some yellow blobs on the cover ."
"`` minions . ''"
"`` ah , i see ."
"you want to watch this . ''"
"mason bobbed his head ."
"`` is it your favorite ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` uh , huh , '' mason replied ."
"`` then i guess we better eat fast so we can watch it . ''"
"at mason 's beaming grin , pesh felt a little tug in his chest ."
"even though he should n't , he already had strong feelings for the little boy ."
"from almost the moment they 'd met , mason had let pesh into his world ."
"the sound of a fork clattering on a plate brought pesh out of his thoughts ."
"`` done ! ''"
"mason exclaimed , hopping out of his chair ."
"although pesh was n't finished , mason grabbed his hand and led him from the table ."
"instead of arguing with him , pesh just let himself be dragged over to the tv ."
"once he got the movie on , they settled down on the couch ."
"he could n't fight the warmth that spread through his chest when mason snuggled close to his side ."
"instead , he just embraced the feeling and let happiness override the doubt that screamed in his mind ."
"under the strong , warm jets of the jacuzzi tub , megan 's pain started to fade ."
"of course , as much as she tried to relax , it was too hard considering that pesh was in her living room ."
"she could n't believe that he had shown up out of the blue to check on her ."
"just when she thought he could n't be any kinder or more attentive , he did something like that ."
"tilting her neck on the foam headrest , she thought about her talk with kristi the day before ."
"she hated to admit it , but she knew she had a choice to make ."
"she either had to let go of pesh , or she had to make things official with him ."
"they could n't just keep dating and hooking up ... or was it just hooking up ?"
"with a frustrated groan , she shifted in the tub , sloshing the water around ."
"closing her eyes , she tried to search her heart for how she truly felt ."
"no man had ever made her feel like felt with pesh , and that could be said both inside and out of the bedroom ."
"gazing down at her pruning fingers , she knew it was time to get out of the tub ."
"she could stay there for days and still not have the answer she so desperately sought ."
"after she toweled off and wrapped herself in her terry cloth robe , she went out into the bedroom ."
"as she threw on a fresh pair of pajama pants and a t-shirt , she noticed it was awfully quiet in the living room ."
"wondering what mason and pesh could be doing , she ducked out of the bedroom ."
"the sight across from her on the couch made her chest clench with emotion ."
"reaching up , she clutched her t-shirt over her heart , trying to still some of the ache that burned there ."
"with the strains of despicable me playing in the background , pesh lay on his back with mason on top of him ."
"her son 's face was snuggled into pesh 's chest , and he was sound asleep ."
"they both were ."
"pesh 's face was tilted down , his nose pressed into the strands of mason 's hair ."
"before she could harden herself to the emotions coursing through her , tears stung her eyes ."
"in that moment , she allowed herself to fantasize that this was truly her life ."
"she had a loving husband who adored her , and her son had an attentive and doting father ."
"what more could she ask for in life ?"
"in those minutes of weakness , she wondered why she had been fighting pesh so hard about a relationship ."
"besides her own happiness , there was nothing more in the world that she wanted than for mason to be safe and happy ."
"as she came crashing back to reality , she saw things clearly for the first time in a long time ."
"pesh had been so worried about her that he 'd driven over just to check on her ."
"she 'd never had a boyfriend who cared about her that much , and no matter how hard she searched in the future , she was probably never going to find another man like pesh ."
"there were so many things about him that she liked ... maybe even loved ."
"he made her want to get up in the mornings , so she could see him at work ."
"she found herself anxiously checking her phone to see if she had a text from him ."
"she loved spending time with him ."
"but it was more than just the feelings that pesh felt for her or that she felt for him-it was the fact that he cared so much about her son ."
"they were a package deal for any future man , and he had willingly embraced that fact without complaint ."
"on shaky legs , she walked over to the couch ."
"as she stood over the two of them , she could n't help reaching out her hand and tenderly touching pesh 's cheek ."
"he stirred at the contact ."
"when his eyelids fluttered open , she smiled at him ."
"`` hi . ''"
"his gaze spun around the room like he was trying hard to remember where he was ."
"when he glanced down at mason , realization washed over his face ."
"`` sorry ."
"i did n't mean to fall asleep . ''"
"`` it 's okay ."
"i 'm sure you needed it ."
"besides , i took too long in the tub . ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` i would argue that you need it as well . ''"
"bending over , she slid her hand under mason 's stomach while the other went under his legs ."
"she hoisted him up and into her arms ."
"when he whimpered , she murmured , `` shh , mommy 's going to put you to bed . ''"
"`` night , night , pesh , '' mason mumbled drowsily ."
"`` good night , little man , '' pesh replied ."
"once she had tucked mason in and kissed his cheek , she closed his bedroom door and returned to the living room ."
"pesh sat hunched over on the edge of one of the couch cushions , as if he were planning to leave as soon as she came back ."
"`` is he okay ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she nodded ."
"`` out like a light the moment i put him down . ''"
"`` good . ''"
"when he started to stand up , she pushed him back down on the couch ."
"easing down onto his lap , she wrapped her arms around his neck ."
"he brought his hand up to rub lazy circles over her back ."
"she did n't speak for a few minutes ."
"instead , she just enjoyed being close to him , the feel of his hand on her , his strong , muscled thighs beneath her ."
"`` thank you for coming over tonight . ''"
"his brows rose in surprise ."
"`` are you sure ?"
"i was afraid i was overstepping my bounds . ''"
"raking her fingers through his dark hair , she shook her head ."
"`` i think we need to talk about our boundaries . ''"
"`` oh ? ''"
"she nodded ."
"`` you coming over here tonight made me realize something very important ."
"what we 've been doing has been fun , and i 've enjoyed every minute of it ."
"but now- '' pesh 's dark eyes snapped shut , and the expression on his face shifted as if he were in pain ."
"`` please ."
"you do n't have to say this ."
"i 'll just go . ''"
"`` but i do n't want you to go , '' she argued ."
"`` then what are you trying to say ? ''"
"`` that i need you in my life , and i want more . ''"
"his brows shot up ."
"`` more ?"
"as in more of us together ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"he sucked in a breath ."
"`` you want us to be an official couple ? ''"
"she smiled ."
"`` yes , i do ."
"well , everywhere except work . ''"
"`` i ca n't believe it , '' he murmured ."
"`` this is n't exactly the reaction i thought you would have , '' she teased ."
"`` oh , i 'm happy ."
"trust me ."
"i 'm just shocked , that 's all . ''"
"she brought her lips to his and gave him a tender kiss ."
"against his lips , she murmured , `` can you ever forgive me for being so stubborn and so stupid ? ''"
"`` i can try ."
"but i suppose you 're going to have to work very hard to make it up to me . ''"
"`` am i ? ''"
"he nodded ."
"`` yes , very hard . ''"
"`` why do i have the funny feeling that your idea of me making it up to you is entirely different than mine ? ''"
"`` no more orgasms for dates ."
"just dates . ''"
"`` i can handle that . ''"
"a wicked gleam flashed in pesh 's eyes ."
"`` the first date will be to the fox to see an opera . ''"
"she groaned ."
"`` you do n't play fair . ''"
"he ran his hands up her sides , causing her to shiver ."
"`` i would have to argue that you have n't been playing fair all along ."
"now it 's my turn . ''"
"`` are you going to punish me ? ''"
"she questioned in a whisper ."
"`` mmm , hmm , there will lots of dates and lots of time spent together . ''"
"he quirked a brow at her ."
"`` a true hell on earth . ''"
"she could n't help giggling ."
"`` i 'll be a good girl and take it . ''"
"`` i 'm glad to hear it . ''"
"as they lapsed into silence , megan 's fingers wound through the hair at the base of his neck ."
"`` do you want to stay the night with me ? ''"
"pesh 's brows furrowed as if silently questioning her proposal ."
"`` but you- '' `` no sex ."
"just sleeping . ''"
"`` you think that 's a good idea with mason ? ''"
"`` we 're a couple now ."
"he 's going to be seeing a lot of you . ''"
"pesh smiled ."
"`` yes , he is . ''"
"staring into his eyes , she asked , `` so you 'll stay ? ''"
"`` it would be a pleasure . ''"
"without another word , she rose off his lap ."
"after he got up off the sofa , she took him by the hand and led him to her bedroom ."
"as she sat on the edge of the mattress , she watched as pesh stripped down to his boxer shorts ."
"when he was finished , he walked slowly over to her ."
"`` i 'm sorry we ca n't do anything else . ''"
"he brushed the hair out of her face and cupped her cheeks ."
"`` i do n't mind ."
"i 'm happy just to be with you . ''"
"in her heart , she was happy as well and not just about him staying the night ."
"but for how everything between them had worked out ."
"`` so am i , '' she murmured before lying back on the bed ."
"`` so am i . ''"
"chapter eighteen for megan , the next few weeks flew by ."
"she did n't know if it was because she was so busy at work , or it was because she was so happy being with pesh ."
"she liked to think it was the latter ."
"or maybe it was that she was busy being with pesh ."
"on her off days and his , they spent every second together ."
"most often , he came to her house ."
"they made dinner together or they went out ."
"although her parents did n't entirely approve , he slept over as well ."
"what they did n't know is that some nights nothing illicit even happened between them ."
"exhausted from the day 's events , they merely enjoyed lying in each other 's arms ."
"as she came out of a patient 's room , she glanced up to see pesh standing across the hall talking to another doctor ."
"for just a moment , his gaze met hers , and although no one else could have possibly noticed it , she saw the longing and the affection ."
"she gave him a brief nod before walking on to the nurses ' station ."
"since they had become a couple , their time at work had become almost a game of wills to pretend there was nothing going on between them ."
"most days , it was harder than megan could have ever imagined not to burst out in a smile whenever she saw him or to resist the urge not to wrap her arms around him ."
"but somehow they made it work ."
"in the end , the pent up emotions that were suppressed during the day made for a lot of heated fireworks in the evenings ."
"megan 's thoughts were interrupted at the buzzing of her phone ."
"when she glanced down at it , she grinned ."
"it was pesh ."
"it killed me not to be able to kiss you a moment ago ."
"i know ."
"me too ."
"dinner at my place tonight ?"
"u cooking ?"
"she questioned ."
"yeah ."
"indian food ."
"mmm , sounds good ."
"what time ? ''"
"7 ."
"does mason like indian food ?"
"megan eyed his text thoughtfully ."
"the last three times she had been with pesh , mason had been with them as well ."
"pesh never seemed to mind , but megan wanted a night with just him ."
"a true date night ."
"not sure ."
"will get my parents or papa to babysit ."
"you do n't have to do that ."
"i know ."
"i want to ."
"okay ."
"see you at 7 ."
"bye ."
"she had just slipped her phone back in her pocket when she was ambushed by kara ."
"since the day she 'd seen kara grope pesh in the hallway , megan had loathed the sight of her ."
"she had managed to keep her distance from her at work , but lately , she noticed that kara had been creeping around , staring at her ."
"`` can i do something for you ? ''"
"megan asked politely ."
"`` yeah , for starters , you can drop the sugar sweet act ."
"i know how you feel about me . ''"
"megan fought the urge to roll her eyes ."
"instead , she crossed her arms over her chest ."
"`` fine ."
"what do you need kara ? ''"
"kara glanced around them before she spoke ."
"`` i want you to back off of pesh . ''"
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"narrowing her eyes , kara said , `` i know you 're into him ."
"i can see it in the way you look at him ... it 's in the way he looks at you , too ."
"and i do n't like it . ''"
"`` well , i 'm terribly sorry that you do n't , but frankly , i do n't see how any of that is any of your business . ''"
"`` oh , he is very much my business considering we 've been together . ''"
"`` um , okay ."
"whatever , '' megan replied , feeling slightly shattered by kara 's proclamation ."
"in the rational side of her mind , she knew there was no way pesh could be involved with kara ."
"but at the moment , it was the irrational side that seemed to be winning out over whether pesh was truly hers ."
"kara jerked her chin in the air ."
"`` besides the fact of what pesh and i are to each other , i 'm sure it would be very interesting business to your professor ."
"last time i checked , a nursing candidate was n't supposed to get involved with a doctor ."
"bad for one 's reputation . ''"
"`` are you threatening me ? ''"
"after a casual shrug of her shoulders , kara replied , `` just stating facts ."
"you do n't impress me as one of those bimbo girls who likes to be used by a man for sex , which i 'm afraid that 's exactly what pesh is doing with you ."
"but more than not wanting to be a sex toy , i imagine you would n't want to do anything to harm your future career . ''"
"`` i 'm not discussing this any further , '' megan muttered , as she started past her ."
"`` i wo n't be either as long as you stay away from pesh . ''"
"without giving kara a final glance , megan continued walking down the hallway ."
"she did n't know where she was going , but she knew she wanted to put as much distance as she could between herself and kara ."
"the rest of the day she felt haunted by kara 's words ."
"more than anything , she could n't wait until she could be alone with pesh to talk to him about it ."
"pesh jerked his head up at the loud bang behind him ."
"the garage door leading into the kitchen was thrown open with such a force that it rattled on its hinges ."
"megan stalked into the room , her mouth turned down in a determined frown ."
"she threw her purse down onto the floor beside one of the bar stools ."
"with a frustrated breath , she blew back a few errant strands of blonde hair that had escaped the loose knot at the back of her neck ."
"`` bad day ? ''"
"he asked , with thinly veiled amusement ."
"she glared at him ."
"`` yes , as a matter of fact it was . ''"
"`` what happened ? ''"
"`` well , where do i start ?"
"when i went to drop mason off at papa 's house , there was a woman there with him . ''"
"pesh 's brows rose in surprise ."
"`` patrick is dating ? ''"
"`` he claims she's- '' megan paused to make air quotes with her fingers , `` just a friend ."
"but i do n't buy it . ''"
"as he stirred the rice , he glanced at her over his shoulder ."
"`` would it be wrong if he were dating ? ''"
"a long sigh escaped megan 's lips ."
"`` no , he deserves to be happy ."
"my nana has been dead for six years , so it 's not like he raced out the moment he was free and started going through women like kleenex . ''"
"pesh chuckled at her summation ."
"`` did you not like her ? ''"
"crossing her arms over her chest , megan replied , `` that 's the other part ."
"she seemed really nice ."
"and mason loves her ."
"i guess she 's been there before when he stayed with papa . ''"
"after abandoning his place by the stove , pesh placed his hands on the marble countertop and leaned in close to megan ."
"`` it sounds to me like patrick has found a good woman who loves him and his family ."
"i do n't think you could ask for a better scenario . ''"
"she stared into his eyes for a moment before she smiled ."
"`` you 're right ."
"i do n't know why i got so upset about it all . ''"
"`` because as much as you love your grandfather , you 're still protective of your grandmother 's memory . ''"
"`` you 're so wise , '' she murmured ."
"`` it comes with age , '' he replied , with a wink ."
"`` whatever . ''"
"he gave her a quick kiss on the lips before returning to the stove ."
"`` so besides patrick 's new lady friend , what else happened to get you so upset ? ''"
"when megan did n't reply , pesh turned around ."
"`` what else is it ? ''"
"`` you need to have a serious discussion with kara . ''"
"his brows rose in surprise ."
"`` i do ? ''"
"`` yes , you do . ''"
"`` megan , you do remember that i 'm not in charge of nurses . ''"
"she rolled her eyes ."
"`` yes , i realize that ."
"but you are in charge of your dick , are you not ? ''"
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"crossing her arms over her chest , megan said , `` kara seems to think that the two of you are an item . ''"
"pesh chuckled ."
"`` oh that 's nonsense ."
"we 're just friends from working together . ''"
"megan narrowed her eyes suspiciously at him ."
"`` you 've never seen her outside of work ? ''"
"this was one area of questioning he had n't bargained on ever having to answer ."
"the truth was something he really did n't want to admit to megan ."
"carefully choosing his words , he replied , `` we got together for drinks a couple of times after work a few months back ."
"i hardly think that categorizes us as an 'item . '"
"''"
"`` it must be enough for her to think she can tell me that you 're only using me for sex . ''"
"pesh winced at the words ."
"he would have never taken kara for being someone who was jealous ."
"he put down the spatula and turned off the stove ."
"he knew he could n't go forward without coming clean ."
"`` megan , i have n't been honest with you . ''"
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` i told you that kara and i had only had drinks a couple of times ."
"but that is n't the whole truth . ''"
"megan 's eyes widened ."
"`` what are you saying ? ''"
"defeated , his shoulders drooped a little ."
"`` after the night of noah 's baptism , i could n't get you off my mind ."
"i wanted to prove to myself that i was n't so enamored by you ."
"so after having a couple of drinks one night , kara and i went to my car and fooled around . ''"
"`` you got drunk ? ''"
"he gave a mirthless laugh ."
"`` that is what is most shocking to you in what i just told you ? ''"
"`` did you think i would be mad at you for messing around with some woman when we were n't dating ? ''"
"`` yes , '' he answered honestly ."
"megan shook her head ."
"`` what you did then was your business ."
"i mean , i 'm not thrilled to hear that you fooled around with her , especially since you would n't sleep with me when i asked you to . ''"
"`` but do n't you see the difference ?"
"i cared for you , and i cared nothing for her ."
"we were barely in the car fifteen minutes if that tells you anything . ''"
"the corners of her lips tugged up in a small smile ."
"`` i really do n't need the details of how much you did n't enjoy yourself . ''"
"he ducked his head ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i should n't have said that . ''"
"`` but at the same time , i 'm glad to hear that you wo n't be going back for a repeat performance . ''"
"jerking his gaze up to meet hers , he replied , `` never could i do that . ''"
"`` and you really were trying to get me off your mind ? ''"
"`` yes , i was . ''"
"`` in a warped way , that 's very romantic , '' she teased ."
"`` i 'm glad you think so , '' he mumbled ."
"`` look , it 's not the fact that she said you were using me for sex that has me so upset . ''"
"`` it 's not ? ''"
"`` she threatened me . ''"
"pesh 's eyes narrowed ."
"`` physically ? ''"
"`` not exactly ."
"she said that if i did n't watch my back , she would report me to the dean . ''"
"a low growl erupted from pesh 's chest ."
"`` she seriously said that ? ''"
"`` yes , she did . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry that her jealousy and spitefulness is rearing its head ."
"i never imagined she was such a person when i ... well , when i got involved with her ."
"i 'll make sure to speak to her ."
"no one should have to work in a hostile environment , and she must understand that just because of her seniority , she is not allowed to harass you . ''"
"pesh watched megan fidget on her feet while nibbling on her bottom lip ."
"`` do you not want me to speak to her ? ''"
"`` no , that 's fine ."
"it 's just ... '' `` is there something else ? ''"
"`` you know how much i like you ."
"i mean , the very fact i agreed to date you shows how much i 'm committed to you . ''"
"pesh crossed his arms over his chest ."
"`` i 'm thinking there 's a 'but ' coming that i 'm not going to like . ''"
"megan sighed ."
"`` but at the same time , whatever it is that is happening between us ... '' she swallowed hard ."
"`` i 've worked really hard in school , pesh ."
"i do n't want anything on my record that could hurt my chances of getting a job . ''"
"if she was the crying type , he would have sworn her eyes shimmered with tears ."
"he came around the counter to pull her into his arms ."
"`` hey now , do n't you worry one bit about getting into trouble ."
"anyone who has seen you in action on the floor knows what a talented and gifted nurse you are . ''"
"she sniffled ."
"`` if there 's even a rumor of me having an affair with an attending physician , i could be blacklisted . ''"
"pesh pulled away to grip her chin in his fingers ."
"`` after i speak to kara , you will have nothing to worry about , okay ? ''"
"he could tell that even though she wanted to relax and let go of her anxiety , she could n't ."
"`` come on ."
"let 's fix you up . ''"
"she wiped her eyes ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"with a wink , he went over to the cabinet and got down a wine glass ."
"then he poured some white wine into the glass before setting it down on the bar ."
"`` take that . ''"
"megan glanced at the glass and then back at him ."
"`` are you trying to ply me with wine ? ''"
"`` maybe . ''"
"she leaned forward and picked it up ."
"he watched as she could n't resist the temptation and she took a hearty gulp ."
"closing her eyes , she murmured , `` that 's so good . ''"
"`` i 'm glad you like it . ''"
"he walked around the counter again ."
"this time he took her free hand ."
"`` come on . ''"
"`` where are we going ? ''"
"`` for part two of your relaxation . ''"
"megan smiled at him before he began tugging her down the hall ."
"when he got into the bedroom , he noticed her sigh of frustration when they bypassed the bed for the bathroom ."
"`` while i finish dinner for us , you need to soak in a nice , hot bath . ''"
"`` you spoil me , '' she protested with a smile ."
"he gave her a playful wink before turning on the bath water ."
"once he got the temperature right , he turned back to her ."
"`` bubbles ?"
"bath salt ? ''"
"she raised her brows ."
"`` do n't tell me you actually have those ?"
"i mean , i know you 're a metrosexual but really ? ''"
"`` we all have our secrets , '' he replied ."
"he did n't have the heart to tell her that he had kept some of jade 's bath and body works stuff ."
"he might 've tried to bury them under the bathroom counter to get them out of sight and out of mind , but they were still there ."
"he rummaged around to pull out a vanilla bottle as well as a peach ."
"he held them up to megan for her approval ."
"`` hmm , vanilla . ''"
"`` good choice . ''"
"it was the one scent that did n't remind him of jade since she never used it ."
"he poured a healthy cupful under the water , letting the foam magnify ."
"`` ready to get in ? ''"
"megan glanced down at herself before looking back at him ."
"`` well , i seem to still be dressed . ''"
"pesh cocked his head at her ."
"`` oh really ?"
"i can help you with that . ''"
"he took the wine glass from her and sat it on the counter ."
"his fingers came to the hem of her shirt ."
"without taking his eyes off of hers , he jerked it up and over her head ."
"he gazed down at her simple , white bra ."
"she sucked in a breath when his fingers skimmed her abdomen before he gripped the waistband of her scrubs and tugged them down ."
"she stepped out of the pants , standing before him in only her bra and skimpy thong ."
"taking her by the shoulders , he gently turned her around ."
"his fingers trailed down her back to the clasp of her bra ."
"once he unhooked it , he brought his hands up to slide it off her shoulders ."
"unable to resist the softness of her skin , he bent his head to kiss along her back ."
"as he dropped the bra to the floor , his hands skimmed up her ribcage to cup her br**sts ."
"`` mmm , '' megan murmured , letting her head fall back against his chest ."
"`` i 'm only supposed to be undressing you , '' he argued , as he let her br**sts fall free of his hands ."
"she immediately picked them up and brought them back to cup her flesh ."
"`` i like the way you undress me ."
"it 's very relaxing . ''"
"rolling her puckered ni**les between his fingers , he was rewarded with her gasp of pleasure ."
"`` the water is getting cold , '' he warned ."
"`` i 'm getting so hot , i can warm it up . ''"
"he chuckled against her ear before taking his hands away from her ."
"as she whined in protest , his fingers jerked her thong down over her thighs ."
"she raised her feet to step out of the underwear ."
"`` all right ."
"get in . ''"
"`` tease , '' she muttered , before walking over to the tub ."
"he only got to admire her na**d backside for a moment before she lowered herself into the tub and disappeared under the foam ."
"leaning back against the wall , she closed her eyes in bliss ."
"`` this feels amazing . ''"
"`` good . ''"
"`` but you know what would feel even better ? ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"her eyes popped open , and she smiled invitingly up at him ."
"`` if you were in here with me . ''"
"`` really ? ''"
"`` mmm , hmm . ''"
"`` i should be finishing dinner , '' he argued , feebly ."
"megan eyed the growing bulge in his pants ."
"`` i think you should be in here letting me finish you . ''"
"he threw his head back and laughed ."
"`` fine ."
"you drive a hard bargain , my lady . ''"
"he quickly unbuttoned and took off his shirt ."
"then his fingers went to the button and zipper on his pants ."
"he slid them and his boxers down and stepped out of them , leaving him naked ."
"megan did n't take her eyes off him the whole time ."
"he shifted them in the water , bringing megan up to straddle him , but she was facing away from him ."
"`` what are you doing ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he brought his hands to her shoulders and started massaging the tense muscles ."
"`` helping you relax . ''"
"she ground herself against his erection ."
"`` i was hoping a couple of orgasms would do that instead . ''"
"he chuckled ."
"`` do n't you believe in foreplay ? ''"
"`` yes , but not when i 'm this horny . ''"
"bending his head , he let his warm breath tickle her outer ear ."
"`` you , my love , are never going to be a candidate for tantric sex ."
"you will never allow yourself to enjoy delayed pleasure and release . ''"
"`` i want to try-honest , i do . ''"
"`` but just not this evening , right ? ''"
"one of his hands abandoned her shoulder to slide down in between her legs ."
"she gasped as his thumb rubbed against her clit ."
"as he continued stroking her with his thumb , he pushed two fingers into her slick passage ."
"megan whimpered and thrust her h*ps against him ."
"pesh kissed and licked her wet neck and back as he pumped his fingers in and out of her ."
"`` does that feel good ? ''"
"`` yes , oh yes , '' she murmured ."
"he increased the pressure of his thumb , and megan shrieked , bucking her h*ps faster and faster against his fingers ."
"when his other hand cupped and kneaded her breast , she cried out and came , her walls clenching against his fingers ."
"once she finished shuddering , she collapsed back against him ."
"`` feeling better now ? ''"
"`` a little . ''"
"she twisted her body around to where she was facing him ."
"`` i want you inside me the next time i come . ''"
"she rose up and then took his erection in her hand ."
"while keeping her eyes on his , she guided him into her core ."
"slowly , she sunk inch by inch on him ."
"when she was fully seated , they both moaned at the feeling ."
"at the intensity of what he felt inside her , pesh was thankful she had taken him up on the birth control script where he did n't have to use condoms anymore ."
"she brought her hands up to his shoulders , and then she began to ride him ."
"his hands came to grip her waist as his head bent forward to suckle one of her ni**les into his mouth ."
"his teeth grazed the bud before his tongue flicked and teased it into a hardened point ."
"throwing her head back , megan 's walls tensed and convulsed around him ."
"he knew he had a long way to go before he was going to come ."
"once she recovered , megan panted as she started riding him faster , causing the water to slosh around them ."
"as his mouth latched onto her other breast , megan threw her head back and moaned ."
"`` harder , '' she urged ."
"pesh continued sucking her nipple as he began to thrust his h*ps up in time to meet her movements ."
"each time he went a little deeper , and it caused megan to be more and more vocal ."
"she tugged at the strands of his hair and clawed at his chest as she strove harder and harder for her orgasm ."
"`` please , please , '' she panted , as her hands came to cup her own br**sts ."
"as she pinched and tweaked her own ni**les , it was pesh 's undoing ."
"shoving his hand down between her legs , he flicked her clit , sending her over the edge again ."
"her movements caused him to jerk once and then come in her ."
"once he finished shuddering and came back to himself , megan stared at him with an utterly satiated expression ."
"`` that was ... amazing . ''"
"`` thank you . ''"
"`` where did a nice boy like you learn to f**k ? ''"
"pesh chuckled at her choice of language ."
"`` you know , a person 's reputation has nothing to do with how they are in the bedroom ."
"i 'm sure there are many tough biker dudes out there who would n't know a clitoris from a labia-if they even knew that terminology . ''"
"`` hmm , i suppose that 's true ."
"my ex liked to think he was a ladies man , but half of the time , i had to take matters into my own hands if i was going to finish . ''"
"she shot him a wicked grin ."
"`` thankfully , i have a lover now who has the most amazing tongue and dick ."
"i never have to worry about coming now . ''"
"`` and do n't you forget how amazing he is . ''"
"her expression turned solemn as she replied , `` i could never forget his attributes both in and out of the bedroom . ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` i 'm glad to hear that . ''"
"after he gave her a somewhat chaste kiss , he asked , `` how about we test out my kitchen attributes now ? ''"
"`` sounds good ."
"i 'm starving , '' she replied , as she climbed out of the tub ."
"pesh followed her out , handing her one of his plush towels ."
"after she finished drying off , he gave her a terry cloth robe to put on ."
"she slid it on and tied the front together ."
"`` wait here ."
"i 'll bring it to you . ''"
"`` dinner in bed ?"
"that would be marvelous . ''"
"he winked before heading out of the bedroom ."
"he fixed two heaping platefuls of food ."
"after putting the plates on a tray , he got two bottles of water out of the fridge ."
"when he got back to the bedroom , he found her lounging back against the pillows with an expression of pure relaxation ."
"after he set the tray down on the bed , he smiled ."
"`` i want to try something with you . ''"
"`` what is it ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he undid the ties on his robe , letting it fall open ."
"after shrugging it off his shoulders , he stood na**d before her ."
"megan 's eyes widened ."
"`` what are you doing ? ''"
"without answering her , he climbed onto the bed ."
"his hands went to the lapels on her robe ."
"he opened them and then pushed the robe open to her waist ."
"`` i thought we were eating dinner , '' she murmured huskily ."
"`` we are . ''"
"while her brows furrowed in confusion , he passed her a plate and a fork ."
"then he took his ."
"`` pesh , why are we eating dinner naked ? ''"
"`` i want to teach you about delayed gratification . ''"
"`` the tantric stuff ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"she eyed him curiously ."
"`` okay . ''"
"`` look into my eyes , '' he commanded ."
"when her blazing blue eyes were trained on his , he brought a forkful of food to her mouth ."
"`` open up , '' he said ."
"her gaze held his as her tongue darted out , tentatively tasting the spicy rice ."
"when she decided that she liked it , her mouth clamped over the fork ."
"as she chewed , she still remained staring at him ."
"`` feed me , '' he insisted ."
"she momentarily broke their eye contact to stare down at the plate ."
"she speared a piece of lamb before bringing it to his mouth ."
"after he took in the bite , his tongue slid over his lips , licking up the remaining sauce ."
"something stirred in her at his action-a slight tremble ."
"he brought a piece of lamb to her mouth , and she wrinkled her nose ."
"`` i do n't like lamb . ''"
"he nodded and then took the bite for himself ."
"he then picked some of the vegetables and brought them to her ."
"this time she took the forkful ."
"`` it 's very good , pesh . ''"
"`` i 'm glad you like it . ''"
"each time she took the fork into her mouth , he could n't help imagining that it was his c**k instead ."
"sitting na**d with her in such a close proximity had his juices beginning to flow ."
"when she lowered her gaze to eye her plate for his next bite , she caught sight of his growing erection ."
"immediately , she started to put her plate down , but he stopped her ."
"`` not yet . ''"
"`` but you 're hard , and i 'm getting wet sitting here with you staring at me like you 're already buried inside me . ''"
"`` that 's the point , my love ."
"how good do you think it 's going to be when i do finally get inside you ? ''"
"`` oh , '' she murmured ."
"as she swept up a forkful of rice , she brought it to his mouth ."
"`` so how long do we do this ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` until we clean our plates . ''"
"she appeared both disappointed and frustrated at his response ."
"to give her something else to focus on , he brought the fork to her mouth ."
"she took from him , chewing methodically while staring into his eyes ."
"each time he fed her a bite , he tried conveying through his gaze what he was imagining doing to her ."
"a bite of vegetables had him sucking her breast , his tongue flicking over her nipple ."
"a forkful of rice had his face buried in her wet core as he licked her juices ."
"as she chewed and swallowed , pesh could tell desire was overtaking her ."
"`` can i have some water ? ''"
"she asked ."
"with a nod , he brought one of the bottles to her lips ."
"she drank in long gulps , her eyes never leaving his ."
"when she finished swallowing , she gave him a grateful smile ."
"then in a flash , she tackled him , causing his plate to flip over onto the sheets ."
"`` megan ! ''"
"he cried ."
"she was too busy kicking out of her robe to care ."
"at the sight of smeared vegetables and rice on the sheet next to him , he began to laugh ."
"his chest shook so hard that he wanted to clutch his stomach , but megan 's body was in the way ."
"as she gazed down at him , he pushed the long , blonde strands of hair out of her face ."
"`` i do n't believe we were finished eating , '' he chastised ."
"she drew his bottom lip between her teeth , causing him to groan ."
"at the same time , her wet core ground against his cock ."
"`` i guess you 'll just have to punish me the next time , '' she replied ."
"cupping her bu**ocks , he sent a resounding smack against one of her cheeks ."
"her eyes widened ."
"`` pesh nadeen , did you actually just spank my ass ? ''"
"he grinned up at her before smacking the other cheek ."
"`` mmm , i like this side of you , '' she murmured , before bringing her lips to his ."
"as their tongues battled against each other , pesh flipped megan over onto her back ."
"after spreading her legs , he buried himself deep inside her with one thrust ."
"`` oh god , that feels amazing , '' she cried ."
"`` see how much better it is when you wait ? ''"
"he questioned , as he leisurely moved in and out of her ."
"`` yes , mmm , it 's so good ."
"you 're right . ''"
"although her body trembled , she was n't close yet ."
"he continued his pace of slow strokes within her ."
"then he took her legs and put them on his shoulders to where he could pump deeper inside her ."
"she moaned at the feeling , her hands sliding up above her head to grip the sheets ."
"pesh ducked his head to bring his mouth to her br**sts , alternating between each one ."
"as he felt her begin to tense up , he increased the pressure of his tongue on her ni**les , lightly grazing them with his teeth ."
"and then she came apart beneath him , crying out and clasping her hands onto his shoulders ."
"the sight of her was so alluring he could n't hold back , and he came in a rush inside her ."
"when he 'd finished shuddering , he raised his head to gaze down at her ."
"her eyelids fluttered open , and then she smiled sheepishly up at him ."
"`` sorry for being a tantric sex failure . ''"
"he laughed ."
"`` baby , i do n't care about that one bit ."
"i like the fact you 're aggressive when it comes to f**king . ''"
"her hands feathered over his back and down to his ass ."
"as she squeezed his cheeks , he sucked in a breath ."
"`` you 're very good at that . ''"
"`` you think so ? ''"
"`` mmm , hmm . ''"
"`` how good are you at laundry ? ''"
"he asked , motioning to the leftover dinner that was now staining the sheets ."
"she swatted his ass playfully ."
"`` i was planning on taking care of that . ''"
"`` why do n't we get dressed and then sit down and really eat ? ''"
"`` i think that sounds like a good idea . ''"
"`` good ."
"i want to make sure you 're feeling your best for what i have to ask you . ''"
"as he pulled himself off megan , her brows furrowed ."
"`` what is it ? ''"
"`` ca n't it wait until we finish eating ? ''"
"rolling her eyes , megan said , `` you know i ca n't wait for things . ''"
"pesh sighed as he bent down to pick up his robe ."
"as he slid his arm through the hole , he met megan 's questioning gaze ."
"`` i wanted to invite you to dinner at my sister 's house this weekend . ''"
"`` okay , i think i can do that . ''"
"tilting her head , she eyed him suspiciously ."
"`` why did you think i would need to be feeling my best for that ? ''"
"`` it wo n't just be my sister and her husband ."
"all of my family will be there , including my parents . ''"
"megan 's eyes widened ."
"`` you want to introduce me to your parents ? ''"
"`` yes , i would . ''"
"she nibbled on her bottom lip as she was prone to do when she was nervous ."
"`` but that would mean we 're pretty serious , right ? ''"
"`` yes , '' he replied , with utter certainty ."
"scooting to the edge of the bed , she gripped her gaping robe as best she could ."
"she stared up at him ."
"`` you 're not the least bit worried what they 're going to say about you dating me ? ''"
"`` no , i 'm not . ''"
"the corners of her lips tugged up in a smile ."
"`` then i 'll go , '' she said softly ."
"`` really ? ''"
"when she bobbed her head , he rushed forward to wrap her in his arms ."
"`` thank you , my love ."
"you 've made me very happy . ''"
"`` you make me happy every day ."
"it 's the least i can do . ''"
"with her head buried in pesh 's chest , she was finally able to let the smile she had plastered on fade into a frown ."
"while she should have been elated that pesh wanted to introduce her to his family , she could n't help feeling overwhelmed ."
"what if they hated her ?"
"what if their dislike caused pesh to not want to see her anymore ?"
"she did n't want to think about what it would be like not having him in her life ."
"at the same time , it was hard processing all the emotions that pesh 's devotion made her feel ."
"davis had never wanted to introduce her to his parents ."
"she met them by accident after one of his games ."
"now she had a man who wanted nothing more than to share all aspects of his life with her ."
"it was hard to process ."
"in the end , she could only hope that everything went well ."
"chapter nineteen the following day at work when pesh found a lull in patients , he stepped into the nurses ' station ."
"while he said hello to some of the other men and women of the nursing staff , he had a singular focus of getting to megan ."
"when he joined her at the counter where she was doing paperwork , she jumped like he had tasered her ."
"`` go away , '' megan hissed ."
"he chuckled ."
"`` you know , i think i can be seen back here in the nurses ' station without arising any suspicion ."
"after all , i could be discussing a patient with you . ''"
"`` then you better start talking in patient codes very soon . ''"
"`` i wanted to know if it would be all right to pick you up at seven on friday evening ? ''"
"when megan jerked her gaze off the chart she was working on , her blue eyes bulged in horror at him ."
"in a low voice , she said , `` i can not believe you are talking about a date here at work ."
"do you care anything about my reputation ? ''"
"he held his hands up defensively ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i do n't know what i was thinking besides the fact that i missed you and wanted to talk to you . ''"
"megan 's expression softened ."
"`` i 'm sorry , but we ca n't be that way here . ''"
"pesh opened his mouth to protest when a voice behind them cut him off ."
"`` do n't you two look cozy , '' kara mused ."
"pesh whirled around to find kara staring at them with venom burning in her eyes ."
"`` excuse me , but i need to get another chart off the carousel , '' megan said , with her head tucked to her chest ."
"she turned to go , but kara reached out and grabbed her arm ."
"`` if you do n't mind , exam room three needs a clean-up . ''"
"`` kristi is the only one authorized to give me orders around here , '' megan replied ."
"kara pursed her ruby red lips ."
"`` insubordination and sleeping with a doctor-you really have a career death wish , do n't you ? ''"
"megan started to protest , but pesh stopped her ."
"glaring at kara , he said , `` i want to talk to you ."
"alone . ''"
"after shooting megan a triumphant look , kara let pesh lead her out of the nurses ' station and down the hall ."
"`` what in the hell do you think you 're doing ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"`` saving you from making a huge mistake ."
"you do n't need a girl like that-you need a woman to take care of you . ''"
"when her hands started to snake up around his neck , pesh grabbed them ."
"`` do n't touch me ! ''"
"he snarled ."
"a sultry smile spread across her face ."
"`` you liked when i touched you before . ''"
"`` that was one time-a drunken mistake that i regret daily , and i never intend on making again . ''"
"she narrowed her eyes at him ."
"`` so you 're throwing me aside for a young bimbo ? ''"
"`` do not speak that way about megan ever again ."
"do you hear me ? ''"
"`` and do you really feel that she thinks you 're worth throwing her career away for ? ''"
"pesh closed the gap between them ."
"looming over kara , his entire body shuddered in anger ."
"`` listen to me when i say that if you threaten to expose megan one more time , i will make life a living hell for you ."
"as the supervising physician over the er , i can have you shipped off to some hellhole far from here . ''"
"he glared down at her ."
"`` do you understand me ? ''"
"she slowly nodded her head as the realization that there was nothing between them finally dawned on her ."
"`` if you 'll excuse me , i need to go clean my exam room . ''"
"as she hurried past him , pesh exhaled a breath of relief ."
"he never used that tone of voice with women , or men for that matter , unless he was absolutely pushed to do so ."
"but kara 's previous behavior and the way she 'd acted today had forced him to become what he was n't ."
"at the feel of a hand on his back , he whirled around ."
"megan gave him a beaming smile ."
"`` my hero ! ''"
"he laughed at her expression and words ."
"`` you do n't have to worry about her harassing you or me for that matter ."
"i took care of things . ''"
"`` i heard you . ''"
"he grimaced ."
"`` you did ? ''"
"she nodded ."
"`` it was amazing . ''"
"`` i 'm glad you thought so . ''"
"`` i 've never had a man take up for me like that before . ''"
"pesh shook his head ."
"`` that 's a shame . ''"
"`` if we were n't in the middle of the er 's hallway , i 'd kiss you to show my gratitude . ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` i 'll gladly take a rain check . ''"
"`` oh you will ?"
"that 's good to know . ''"
"lowering his voice , he said , `` i 'll expect that kiss later tonight when we 're alone ."
"and i do n't just want it on the lips . ''"
"his brows rose ."
"`` i want it on several places on my body . ''"
"megan grinned ."
"`` i think that can be arranged . ''"
"`` i 'll be looking forward to it . ''"
"`` dr ."
"nadeen ? ''"
"a nurse called from the top of the hall ."
"`` yes ? ''"
"`` you 're needed in rxam room four . ''"
"`` as soon as i finish this patient consultation , i 'll be there , '' he replied ."
"at his blatant lie , megan covered her mouth to hide her giggling ."
"`` i have to go ."
"but can i come over tonight ? ''"
"`` yep ."
"let me get mason fed and bathed , and then i 'm yours . ''"
"`` see you later . ''"
"he winked at her before he turned and started down the hall ."
"a few nights later pesh found himself speeding along the quiet streets of megan 's neighborhood ."
"his phone dinged once again ."
"slowing down , he took a peek to make sure it was n't the hospital ."
"he was n't too surprised to find it was another text from megan ."
"he could tell from the way she had been frantically texting him that afternoon and evening that she was nervous , which was totally surprising to him ."
"she was so strong and fearless that it was hard for him to imagine her ever feeling nervous ."
"but he supposed that in megan 's mind she had good cause to be nervous as tonight he was introducing her to his family ."
"after he picked her up , they were going to his sister , shveta 's , house for dinner ."
"his parents , along with at least one of his brothers , would be there ."
"although he had spent a lot of time with her family , it had n't quite meant the same thing as her spending time with his ."
"he did n't know if her nerves stemmed from simply meeting his family or if they were from the fear of how far their relationship had progressed in the last few months ."
"he turned into the driveway at ten after seven ."
"he did n't even get up the front porch steps before the door flew open , and megan rushed out ."
"her diminutive figure wobbled a little on the black high heels she was sporting ."
"she wore black pants , and a dressy red top that had a lot of beading ."
"it reminded him of the kurta , a style that women from his culture wore ."
"he wondered if she had chosen it for that reason ."
"`` you look beautiful , '' pesh murmured , leaning in to kiss her tenderly ."
"when she did n't warm to his touch , he gazed down at her ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"rolling her eyes , she snapped ."
"`` duh , i 'm really nervous . ''"
"`` you 're really that worried about my family 's opinion of you ? ''"
"she threw up her hands ."
"`` of course , i am ."
"your family is very important to you ."
"i do n't want ... '' she tore her gaze from his ."
"`` you do n't want what ? ''"
"he pressed ."
"`` i do n't want to bring shame to you . ''"
"he bit down on his lip to keep from laughing at her ."
"he could n't believe megan was so concerned with his family 's opinion ."
"his heartbeat accelerated at the thought ."
"it had to mean she really was falling in love with him ."
"he brushed a silky strand of blonde hair out of her face ."
"`` sweetheart , you 're not the first american girl i 've brought home with me . ''"
"`` yes , i 'm well aware of that ."
"i 'm also aware of the fact of how well your family loved and accepted jade ."
"it might not be the same way with me . ''"
"she stared up at him ."
"`` i 'm not like her , pesh ."
"i 'm not meek and good-hearted . ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` that 's not true ."
"you are good-hearted ."
"i see that part of you each and every day . ''"
"cupping her chin with his fingers , he brought her gaze to his ."
"`` you saw my brother , dev ."
"through all of his missteps and antics , my parents still love him very much ."
"so i promise you there is nothing you can do to where they wo n't like you or where you 'll bring shame on me ."
"okay ? ''"
"she gave a reluctant nod ."
"`` okay . ''"
"taking her by the hand , he led her off the porch ."
"once he 'd gotten her in the car , he went around and slid into the driver 's seat ."
"when pesh cranked up the car , megan gasped in horror ."
"`` what ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she motioned to the clock on the dash ."
"`` oh my god , we 're going to be late ."
"can i make a worse first impression ? ''"
"pesh laughed ."
"`` maybe i should tell you a few things , etiquette wise , so tonight will go a little easier . ''"
"`` what does that have to do with us being late ? ''"
"`` because it 's considered good form to arrive thirty minutes late . ''"
"`` seriously ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"`` huh , i did n't know that . ''"
"`` well , how could you ? ''"
"`` i tried doing a little research ."
"i even watched monsoon wedding , '' she said ."
"pesh laughed ."
"`` did you now ? ''"
"`` yeah , it was pretty good ."
"i kinda hated there were n't more dance numbers and songs . ''"
"`` megan , i 'm pretty sure none of my family is going to break out into song like in a bollywood movie tonight , '' he said , with amusement ringing in his voice ."
"she rolled her eyes ."
"`` i did n't expect them to , smart-ass . ''"
"he tsked at her ."
"`` so testy tonight . ''"
"after exhaling a long breath , she gave him an apologetic smile ."
"`` i 'm sorry i 'm so bitchy . ''"
"`` you 're not bitchy . ''"
"`` and you 're lying . ''"
"`` regardless of your out-of-control emotions , i know that my family is going to love you just as much as i do . ''"
"the moment the words left his lips he grimaced ."
"there was the big l word ."
"they had n't actually exchanged it yet , and now he 'd managed to screw up and say it before he could find the right time ."
"`` oh god , did you have to say that now ?"
"like i 'm not nervous enough ! ''"
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he murmured ."
"burying her head in her hands , she groaned ."
"`` this is ... you are ... i ... ''"
"`` look , you don't- '' `` i love you , too ! ''"
"she shouted from behind her hands ."
"his hands jerked on the wheel , and he sent the car careening onto the emergency lane ."
"when he recovered and got the car back into the right lane , he dared himself to look over at her ."
"she peeked at him through her fingers ."
"`` i love you , pesh ."
"i really f**king do . ''"
"`` oh megan , '' he whispered ."
"pulling her hands away from her face , she gave him a genuine smile ."
"`` i love you more than any man i 've ever known . ''"
"`` i love you more- '' suddenly he found himself unable to continue ."
"did he love her more than he had jade ?"
"he had spent years with jade and had only months with megan ."
"if he did love megan more , what did that say about his relationship with jade ?"
"she reached over and took one of his hands in hers ."
"`` hey , you do n't have to say what i said ."
"our situations are completely different . ''"
"he clenched and unclenched his jaw ."
"`` no woman wants half a man 's heart , '' he argued ."
"`` but i know it is n't half your heart ."
"and i would n't want you to stop loving me just because i died , so why would i expect you to do the same with jade ? ''"
"`` it 's not fair to you , '' he croaked ."
"`` life 's not fair , baby ."
"you have to get used to that one . ''"
"she squeezed his hand ."
"`` besides , i know what i feel when i feel your love ."
"there 's no half about it ."
"you love me with all your heart and soul . ''"
"`` i do ."
"i honestly do . ''"
"unfastening her seat belt , she lunged over to kiss him ."
"when she started to deepen the kiss , he had to pull away ."
"`` hey now , you got ta stop that or we 're not going to make it to my parents . ''"
"she giggled and then eased back down into her seat ."
"she managed to behave herself the remaining five minutes ."
"when he pulled into his parents drive , he saw it was already crowded with cars ."
"the sight of so many people set megan off , and she began tapping her fingers nervously on her leg ."
"`` ready ? ''"
"he asked , as he turned to her ."
"`` as i 'll ever be , '' she muttered ."
"he shook his head as he got out of the car ."
"like always , he opened her car door and helped her out ."
"as they started up the sidewalk , megan was a flurry of movement ."
"she smoothed down her hair and then she adjusted her top ."
"then she fiddled with her purse on her shoulder ."
"`` quit fidgeting , '' pesh whispered , as he rang the doorbell ."
"`` i ca n't help it ."
"i 'm nervous . ''"
"he grinned down at her ."
"`` megan , they 're going to love you ."
"i promise . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` they 're going to hate me because i 'm not a submissive indian woman ."
"wait until they hear i had a child out of wedlock ."
"they 'll be ready to disown you then . ''"
"the door flew open , cutting off the rest of their conversation ."
"`` brother , it 's so good to see you ! ''"
"his brother-in-law , sanjay , cried ."
"after he hugged pesh , his gaze went to megan ."
"his eyes widened , and he gasped in surprise ."
"`` uh , hello . ''"
"`` hi , '' megan said ."
"sanjay gave pesh a curious look ."
"`` you did n't tell me you were bringing company . ''"
"`` this is megan . ''"
"with a self-assured tone , he added , `` she 's my girlfriend . ''"
"`` really ?"
"well , what about that ? ''"
"sanjay gave megan a welcoming smile ."
"`` we 're so glad to have you . ''"
"`` thank you , '' megan replied ."
"as sanjay turned to go into the living room , megan smacked pesh 's arm ."
"`` you did n't tell them you were bringing me ? ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` no , i like the element of surprise when it comes to my love life . ''"
"`` s-seriously ? ''"
"she sputtered ."
"`` it 's better this way ."
"trust me . ''"
"before she could say anything else , pesh started taking off his shoes ."
"wide-eyed , megan watched him ."
"quickly , she stepped out of her heels and put them in the pile next to his ."
"`` more etiquette you forgot to tell me ? ''"
"she hissed ."
"he patted the small of her back ."
"`` you 're fine . ''"
"as they came into the living room , pesh felt megan tense at his side ."
"he supposed that it was overwhelming coming into a room packed full of strangers ."
"his sister , shveta , came forward first ."
"`` hello brother ."
"you 're looking well this evening . ''"
"`` thank you ."
"so are you . ''"
"he hugged her tight ."
"as he pulled away , he glanced down at her swollen belly ."
"`` and how is the future prince doing ? ''"
"shveta smiled and brought her hand to her abdomen ."
"`` he 's busy kicking me at the moment . ''"
"when she spied megan behind him , she gasped ."
"`` and who is this ? ''"
"he drew in a breath and gazed around his family ."
"`` before i go through this with each and every one of you , i might as well get it out of the way ."
"i want to introduce you to someone very special , my girlfriend , megan . ''"
"deafening silence reverberated around the room after his statement ."
"his mother and father exchanged a glance before staring back at pesh ."
"megan tucked herself even closer to his side ."
"although public displays of affection between men and women were frowned upon in his culture , he wrapped his arm around her waist ."
"`` well , say something , '' he commanded ."
"`` we 're sorry , son ."
"it 's just you caught us off guard , '' his mother said ."
"his father 's bushy brows rose ."
"`` so you 're really dating , eh ? ''"
"`` yes , i am . ''"
"at his declaration , his father clapped his hands and grinned ."
"`` that is most wonderful to hear ! ''"
"he came forward to embrace megan ."
"`` you are very welcome here . ''"
"`` thank you , '' she said ."
"`` i 'm charlie , '' his father introduced ."
"`` megan , '' she replied , with a small smile ."
"pesh peered past his father where his mother stood chewing her lip ."
"he could tell she was n't entirely happy that another blonde-haired , blue-eyed woman was standing beside her son ."
"while shveta and arjan had both sought out indian partners to marry , he and dev were somewhat the black sheep since they had n't chosen to settle down with women within their culture ."
"finally , his mother 's manners won out over anything else , and she stepped forward to shake megan 's hand ."
"`` i 'm lavani ."
"it 's nice to meet you . ''"
"`` nice meeting you , too , '' megan replied ."
"the room then fell into an awkward silence ."
"pesh glanced around , willing someone to say something ."
"his mother cleared her throat ."
"`` i 'll go and finish up dinner . ''"
"as she started into the kitchen , shveta followed her , along with arjan 's wife ."
"since it was customary for women to be in the kitchen , pesh found it to be only megan left with the men ."
"it did n't go without her notice either ."
"`` should i go and offer to help ? ''"
"she questioned , in a whisper ."
"`` sure ."
"that would be nice . ''"
"her expression told him that she really did n't want to leave his side , but she did anyway ."
"once she was out of earshot , pesh found everyone 's eyes on him ."
"`` what ? ''"
"charlie chuckled ."
"`` you even have to ask , my son ? ''"
"`` so ask your questions and get it over with before megan comes back in here , '' he replied , as he collapsed onto the couch ."
"he faced a barrage of questions about where they met , how long they had been seeing each other , and how serious was it ."
"he mustered as much patience as he could to answer them all ."
"when he was finished , the men sat back in surprised silence ."
"`` i never thought i would see the day , '' his father mused ."
"sanjay shook his head ."
"`` oh , i knew the day would come ."
"i saw that when he was out with emma . ''"
"charlie 's brows furrowed ."
"`` emma ? ''"
"pesh pinched his eyes shut and wished his brother-in-law did n't have such a good memory ."
"`` just a friend . ''"
"with a snort , sanjay replied , `` you certainly did n't look at her like she was a friend , even if she was pregnant . ''"
"`` you were with a pregnant woman ? ''"
"charlie asked ."
"`` alpesh how could you ? ''"
"his mother demanded from the doorway ."
"`` how could i what ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"lavani 's expression was horror stricken ."
"`` get a woman ... in the family way . ''"
"pesh rocketed off the couch ."
"he glanced past his mother to where megan stood ."
"`` you 're ... ? ''"
"he could n't even form the words ."
"megan 's face flushed blood red ."
"`` no !"
"of course , i 'm not ! ''"
"lavani gave him a confused look ."
"`` not her , '' she replied , pointing at megan ."
"`` this emma that sanjay speaks of . ''"
"bringing his hand to his forehead , he rubbed furiously to try to ward off the ache that was starting to pound in his head ."
"everything was getting shot to hell so fast ."
"`` first of all , emma and i were never intimate ."
"she was pregnant by the man she is now married to ."
"yes , i took her to the opera with sanjay and shveta , but there was nothing really between us . ''"
"he shook his head and could n't help wondering if he would ever have to stop explaining what had happened between him and emma ."
"`` second of all , could everyone just back off for a second ?"
"i mean , you 're not exactly giving megan a very good impression of our family . ''"
"a nervous laugh erupted from megan 's lips ."
"she covered her mouth with her hand , trying to hide her giggling ."
"he winked at her , and she lowered her hand to smile at him ."
"`` fine , fine ."
"now that we 've cleared all that up , why do n't we eat ? ''"
"lavani suggested ."
"`` that sounds wonderful , '' charlie replied ."
"as they made their way into the dining room , pesh went to megan 's side ."
"`` you surviving okay ? ''"
"he whispered ."
"`` i 'm hanging in there ."
"i may need a drink when we leave . ''"
"`` just no silver tequila for you , '' he mused ."
"without the others catching her , megan smacked his arm ."
"`` ass , '' she hissed under her breath ."
"he chuckled as he held out the chair for megan ."
"`` thank you , '' she said before sitting down ."
"he then eased in beside her ."
"as the dishes began making their way around the table , he felt megan kick him ."
"when he glanced at her in surprise , she whispered , `` where is the silverware ? ''"
"`` we eat with our hands . ''"
"`` seriously ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"he leaned over to whisper in her ear ."
"`` but do n't use your left hand because it 's considered rude . ''"
"she jerked back to stare wide-eyed at him ."
"`` i 'm left handed , '' she protested ."
"he fought the urge to smile at her horror ."
"he could tell that she would rather die than do something to embarrass him in front of his family ."
"`` you 'll be fine ."
"they wo n't expect as much out of you since you 're american . ''"
"`` alpesh , whatever is it that you 're whispering about ? ''"
"lavani asked , narrowing her eyes at him ."
"`` i was just telling megan what a wonderful cook you are ."
"she loves indian food , so i 'm sure she 's in for a treat . ''"
"pesh squeezed megan 's knee under the table ."
"she cut her eyes over to him and smiled ."
"once the plates had been passed around and everyone served , they began to eat ."
"`` mmm , the samosa is delicious , '' megan complimented ."
"`` thank you , '' lavani replied , with a beaming smile ."
"as his mother turned her attention to shveta , pesh bowed his head and spoke in a low voice to megan ."
"`` once i tried bribing beau with some samosa . ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` you did ?"
"why ? ''"
"`` i was at aidan 's house checking on emma when she was on bed rest ."
"i guess you could say he did n't like me invading his turf . ''"
"`` would he not take it from you ? ''"
"`` oh , he took it , ate it , and seemed to enjoy it ."
"but i did n't make any friends that night . ''"
"megan grinned ."
"`` good old beau . ''"
"pesh raised his brows ."
"`` you 're siding with the dog ? ''"
"`` in that scenario , yes ."
"he was merely protecting emma and noah . ''"
"`` i see . ''"
"tilting her head at him , she added , `` besides , i do n't like any scenario where you and emma are anything more than friends . ''"
"`` i was there in a medical capacity , '' he argued ."
"she wagged her finger at him ."
"`` you brought dinner with you ."
"that fact alone shows you were there for more than just practicing medicine . ''"
"when he quickly pushed her finger down , she gave him a look that was a cross between puzzled and infuriated ."
"`` are you trying to silence me ? ''"
"`` no , i 'm just helping you save face ."
"we do n't point-it 's considered rude . ''"
"megan 's eyes widened ."
"`` i 've done something else wrong now ? ''"
"`` you 're fine . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` next time , you better plan on giving me a crash course in indian culture before you even think about bringing me around your family . ''"
"across the table from them , shveta cleared her throat ."
"when pesh and megan glanced at her , she smiled ."
"`` you 're doing fine , megan ."
"please do n't worry about following all the rules of our culture ."
"we certainly do n't expect you to . ''"
"megan returned shveta 's smile ."
"`` thank you ."
"i would never dream of doing anything to offend you . ''"
"`` of course you would n't , '' charlie replied ."
"pesh did n't dare sneak a peek at his mother ."
"after all , she was the one who upheld the traditions and customs of their heritage while his father had tried to americanize himself as much as possible , right down to changing his name ."
"charlie dabbed the corners of his mouth with his napkin ."
"`` i understand you have a son , megan . ''"
"she smiled ."
"`` yes , mason is almost two ."
"he 's my entire world . ''"
"`` you should have brought him with you this evening ."
"we would have loved to meet him , '' shveta said ."
"`` maybe next time ."
"of course , after you see how much energy he has , you might change your mind . ''"
"as the table laughed , she glanced over at pesh ."
"`` mason truly adores pesh , and pesh is so good with him ."
"his patience is infinite . ''"
"pesh smiled ."
"`` he 's a good boy ."
"i enjoy spending time with him . ''"
"`` so it 's serious between you two ? ''"
"lavani asked ."
"`` uh , well- '' megan began before she was interrupted by the doorbell ."
"sanjay rose out of his chair ."
"`` that must be dev . ''"
"`` how surprising that he 's so late ? ''"
"shveta mused with a smile ."
"pesh almost laughed at the horrified expression on megan 's face at the mention of dev ."
"`` you did n't tell me he was going to be here ! ''"
"she hissed ."
"`` i was n't sure if he was coming or not ."
"but do n't worry ."
"things are fine between us now . ''"
"megan gave him a skeptical look as dev walked into the dining room ."
"`` hey everybody , '' he said , throwing up a hand ."
"at the sight of megan sitting next to pesh , dev 's eyes widened ."
"`` well , well , if it is n't miss right hook , '' he mused with a smirk ."
"`` it 's miss left hook , actually , '' she corrected ."
"dev grinned ."
"`` good to know . ''"
"`` you 've met megan , dev ? ''"
"lavani asked curiously ."
"`` we had the pleasure of meeting each other one day when i went by the hospital to see alpesh . ''"
"at megan 's sharp intake of breath , dev winked at her ."
"he then eased down across from them and began piling food on his plate ."
"`` so you guys work together and now you 're dating , huh ? ''"
"`` yes , '' pesh replied ."
"after taking a bite of his samosa , dev motioned at them while he chewed ."
"`` alpesh is sort of your boss , right ? ''"
"pesh could feel megan 's anger rising ."
"`` no , actually he is n't ."
"i have a preceptor , or head nurse , who is my boss ."
"and before you can make it sound any seedier , it is n't against the hospital rules to date each other ."
"besides , we met each other long before i started working at wellstar . ''"
"`` is that right ? ''"
"dev replied ."
"`` yeah , it is . ''"
"a slow grin slunk across his face ."
"`` i like you , '' he said to megan ."
"`` you have an interesting way of showing it . ''"
"charlie chuckled at the head of the table ."
"`` my , my , alpesh , have n't you picked a feisty one ? ''"
"pesh glanced at megan , who had flushed the red color of her blouse ."
"she gave charlie a weak smile ."
"`` i apologize . ''"
"with a tsk , charlie replied , `` please do n't ."
"it 's been rather refreshing to see you putting dev into his well-deserved place ."
"i understand you punched him , too . ''"
"when his mother gasped in horror , megan fumbled under the table for pesh 's hand ."
"he squeezed it reassuringly as she ducked her head ."
"`` um , well , i 'm sorry to say that i did . ''"
"`` in megan 's defense , i totally deserved it ."
"i punched alpesh and said some really shitty things . ''"
"`` dev ! ''"
"lavani cried ."
"in true dev fashion , he rolled his eyes at his mother 's outrage ."
"`` we 're fine now ."
"everyone calm down . ''"
"he met pesh 's gaze ."
"`` i 'm happy for you , brother ."
"you 've made a good choice . ''"
"he cut his eyes over to megan ."
"`` i hope you both will be very happy together . ''"
"pesh was taken aback by the sincerity in both dev 's words and his expression ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"megan nodded ."
"`` yes , thank you . ''"
"dev leaned back in his chair , clasping his hands behind his head ."
"`` and now to ensure that my news overshadows any excitement brought on by the two of you , i 'd like to announce that i 'm getting married next month- '' lavani once again gasped in horror ."
"but dev was n't finished ."
"`` and i 'm going to be a father . ''"
"pesh 's mouth gaped open as the table erupted in absolute pandemonium ."
"he wondered if his mother was going to pass out ."
"turning to megan , he found her with her napkin over her mouth ."
"from the way her shoulders were moving up and down , he could tell she was laughing ."
"he leaned over to whisper in her ear ."
"`` guess we 're off the hook , huh ? ''"
"she grinned ."
"`` yeah , i think we 're good . ''"
"`` i love you . ''"
"`` i love you more . ''"
"chapter twenty now that he and megan were an official couple who had said the `` l '' word , pesh no longer had days off where he had to wonder how to pass the time ."
"he wanted to spend every waking minute with her and with mason , and she always made sure that they had time together ."
"today found him at patrick 's house , wedged on the couch between some of megan 's male family members ."
"just like at his parents , the women were all stationed in the kitchen , putting the finishing touches on sunday lunch ."
"as soon as becky came in the living room and announced it was time to sit down , there was a stampede to the dining room ."
"he followed slowly behind the others , searching for megan who he felt like was his lifeline in the crowd ."
"`` where 's aidan and emma ?"
"they 're never late , '' angie remarked , as she sat a giant platter on the table ."
"liz shrugged ."
"`` they have n't called ."
"we could go ahead and get started , and then they can start when they get here . ''"
"john pulled out a chair ."
"`` good ."
"i 'm starving . ''"
"becky rolled her eyes ."
"`` you 're always starving ."
"between you and percy , we 're going to be eaten out of house and home . ''"
"pesh hung back as the others started taking their seats at the massive mahogany table ."
"regardless of how welcoming the fitzgerald 's had been , he still could n't help feeling like an outsider ."
"megan came in carrying a plate of ham ."
"after she deposited it on the table , her gaze searched the room for him ."
"when she spotted him , she gave him the smile that always warmed his heart before crooking her finger at him ."
"as he started to join her , mason came running in ."
"`` get me , esh , '' he urged , holding his hands up ."
"pesh grinned as he stooped over to pick mason up ."
"`` are you hungry ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` uh , huh . ''"
"`` are you going to sit with me or pesh ? ''"
"megan asked ."
"`` esh , '' he replied ."
"`` is that okay with you ? ''"
"megan asked ."
"`` we 'll be fine . ''"
"she motioned for him to have a seat ."
"just as they sat down , aidan appeared in the doorway of the dining room with noah in his arms ."
"`` sorry we 're late . ''"
"`` where 's emma ? ''"
"megan asked , as she took noah from aidan ."
"with a grimace , aidan said , `` she is n't feeling well ."
"it seems that with this pregnancy she 's having third trimester morning sickness ."
"i told her i would stay home with her , but she insisted i come get a good meal . ''"
"`` poor thing ."
"we 'll fix her a plate for you to take home to her later on , '' megan said ."
"aidan smiled ."
"`` thanks ."
"if she can eat it , i know she 'll be grateful . ''"
"patrick clicked his fork against his water goblet ."
"`` is everyone here that 's supposed to be here ? ''"
"a chorus of , `` yes , '' rang around the room ."
"`` good ."
"let 's return thanks . ''"
"pesh obediently bowed his head along with the others ."
"when patrick finished , the dishes were passed around and food was served ."
"it was certainly a lot different than how his family did it , but he still enjoyed being with megan 's family ."
"while mason ate off his plate , megan gave aidan a break by feeding noah , or more appropriately letting him drape her in food while he fed himself ."
"`` you 're a mess , '' megan said , into noah 's carrot-and-corn crusted face ."
"his response was to grin at her ."
"`` i 'm sorry , mister , but that cute little grin is n't going to work for me . ''"
"`` he 's so stubborn , '' aidan said ."
"`` a stubborn fitzgerald ?"
"i 've never heard of such , '' becky joked across the table ."
"aidan shook his head ."
"`` i 'm serious ."
"he refuses to let me or em feed him , and then he ends up wearing more than he eats . ''"
"`` sounds like his father , '' angie mused ."
"when aidan gave her an exasperated look , she said , `` you were the exact same way ."
"i do n't think you ate a meal until you were two that mother did n't have to hose you off after you finished . ''"
"aidan grunted ."
"`` do n't tell em that story ."
"she already blames me enough for noah 's stubbornness . ''"
"megan smiled ."
"`` let 's hope that this next baby has emma 's temperament . ''"
"`` like she is n't stubborn , '' aidan countered ."
"`` much less than you are , '' megan replied ."
"pursing his lips , he appeared to be surveying her words ."
"`` you might have a point , '' he said , with a grin ."
"after everyone finished eating , the adults lounged around the table talking and laughing while the kids went into the living room ."
"both mason and noah wanted to go with the bigger kids ."
"`` will you keep an eye on them ? ''"
"megan asked percy ."
"`` sure , '' he replied ."
"`` i owe you , perce , '' aidan said , as percy took the boys by the hand ."
"as he sat with his arm draped over the back of megan 's chair , pesh enjoyed listening to the lively conversation around him ."
"occasionally one of aidan 's sisters would ask him a question or his opinion ."
"he had always been naturally quiet , and when he got in the midst of such a lively bunch , he tended to be even quieter ."
"he realized if he was going to truly fit in , he was going to have to speak up more ."
"their conversation was interrupted by a shriek that came from the living room followed by a loud wail ."
"aidan was out of his chair in a flash while megan was close on his heels ."
"mason came running into the dining room ."
"`` what happened ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` noah got hurted . ''"
"aidan reappeared in the dining room with noah in his arms ."
"`` he 's fine ."
"he just fell down . ''"
"taking noah 's hand , aidan said , `` here daddy will kiss the booboos away , okay ? ''"
"noah sniffled and bobbed his head ."
"once aidan finish with his hand , noah stuck out his leg ."
"aidan smiled ."
"`` okay . ''"
"once he bent down to noah 's leg and kissed it , he asked , `` are you daddy 's boy ? ''"
"`` uh-huh . ''"
"angie chuckled ."
"`` that 's not fair to do that when emma is n't here . ''"
"as the others laughed , pesh glanced at mason ."
"he was staring at aidan and noah with a contemplative look on his face ."
"never in a million years could he have imagined what he would do next ."
"mason crawled up into his lap and patted pesh 's chest ."
"`` esh mace 's daddy ."
"mace daddy 's boy . ''"
"conversation in the dining room silenced ."
"without even looking up , pesh felt his skin singing under the burn of everyone staring at him and mason ."
"there was no way he could deny the boy when he wore such an expression of happiness ."
"`` yes , you 're daddy 's boy . ''"
"a strangled cry caused him to snap his gaze from mason over to megan ."
"wide-eyed and open mouthed , she blinked a few times as if she were trying to believe that what she was seeing was real ."
"then without another word , she bolted from her chair and fled the room ."
"pesh sat in a shocked silence for a few seconds trying to decide what to do ."
"bending over , he whispered into mason 's ear , `` will you go back and play with the others ?"
"i need to check on mommy . ''"
"when mason nodded , pesh gently sat him back down on the floor ."
"after he raced out of the dining room , pesh finally glanced at the others ."
"`` excuse me , '' he said , before rising out of his chair ."
"he made his way down the hallway ."
"he did n't have to look hard for megan-she was in the one bedroom with the door closed ."
"he rapped lightly on the wood ."
"when she did n't answer , he went ahead and opened the door ."
"he found her sitting on the edge of the bed with her head in her hands ."
"he went over and sat down next to her ."
"tentatively , he put his hand on her back ."
"`` i 'm sorry for not setting mason straight and telling him i was n't his daddy ."
"he looked so happy , and i did n't want to hurt him . ''"
"with her elbows braced on her knees , megan turned her head to look at him ."
"tears streamed down her cheeks ."
"`` you think i 'm angry at you ? ''"
"he nodded his head ."
"she hiccupped a cry ."
"`` oh pesh , you 're so naive sometimes ! ''"
"he jerked back at her words ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"`` just when i think i ca n't love you more , you go and do something like that . ''"
"before he could process her words , she threw herself at him , kissing his cheeks and mouth ."
"she straddled his lap and brought her hands around his neck ."
"`` you really love mason , do n't you ? ''"
"`` of course i do . ''"
"`` you could see yourself really being a father to him ? ''"
"`` yes , i could ."
"but what- '' she silenced him with a kiss ."
"it was one that was laced with desperate emotions ."
"he wrapped his hands around her waist and drew her closer to him ."
"just as he was about to deepen the kiss , she pulled away ."
"`` you love me too , do n't you ? ''"
"`` you should have no doubts on that one . ''"
"`` you love me enough to be a husband to me ? ''"
"her question caused him to suck in a harsh breath ."
"he felt like he had been kicked in the gut ."
"`` yes , i could-i always have . ''"
"she tilted her head at him and smiled ."
"`` then marry me . ''"
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"bringing her lips to his , she murmured against his mouth , `` marry me ."
"make me your wife . ''"
"at that moment , he thanked god he was sitting down because if he had n't been , he was pretty sure he would 've done something totally emasculating like fainting ."
"he also questioned both his hearing and his sanity ."
"had megan just proposed to him ?"
"surely , he was hallucinating ."
"`` did you just ask me to marry you ? ''"
"he questioned lamely ."
"giggling , megan nodded her head ."
"`` i wish you could see your face right now ."
"i should be insulted . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"it 's just you surprised me . ''"
"she cupped his face in her hands ."
"`` i 'm sorry i do n't have a ring , and i did n't get down on one knee , '' she lovingly teased ."
"he brought his hands up to touch hers ."
"`` you 're really serious ? ''"
"`` yes , i am . ''"
"bowing his head , he tenderly kissed the tops of her hands ."
"`` i love you so much , megan , and i want nothing more than to make you my wife . ''"
"`` so is that a yes ? ''"
"`` i just want to make sure you know what you 're saying ."
"one minute you 're in the dining room , laughing with your family , and then the next you 're in here weeping and then proposing to me ."
"and let 's not forget how adamant you have been the entire time i 've known you about being too young to get married . ''"
"megan 's lips turned down in a pout ."
"`` ca n't a girl change her mind ? ''"
"`` yes , of course , but i just want to make sure this is really what you want . ''"
"tears sparkled in her blue eyes ."
"`` you are everything i could ever want in a man ."
"you love me , you watch out for me , you want the best for me ."
"while that would be enough to make me want to marry you , you love my son ."
"you watch out for him and you want the best for him ."
"i could n't ever imagine loving someone more than i do you ."
"i ca n't imagine wanting to be anyone else 's wife but you . ''"
"she sniffled ."
"`` i was so stupid for so long ."
"i could n't believe that someone like me could truly deserve someone like you ."
"but you never gave up on me ."
"if you give me the chance , i 'll spend the rest of my life trying to make you happy . ''"
"pesh could n't stop the racing of his heart ."
"he was sure both his heart rate and blood pressure were off the charts at this moment ."
"he cupped her cheeks ."
"`` nothing in the world would make me happier than for us to get married . ''"
"`` so we 're engaged ? ''"
"`` yes , we are . ''"
"when a smile lit up megan 's face , he shook his head ."
"`` but not formally yet ."
"not until i put a diamond on your hand . ''"
"`` but i do n't need that to know i 'm promised to you and that we 're getting married . ''"
"`` maybe you do n't , but i do . ''"
"she rolled her eyes ."
"`` fine , fine ."
"i 'll let you buy me a diamond ."
"a great big one , okay ? ''"
"he laughed ."
"`` i promise to spend a fortune . ''"
"`` you know i would be happy to wear your ring even if it was a little chip . ''"
"`` i know you would ."
"but i want to spoil my beautiful future wife . ''"
"she grinned ."
"`` okay , i wo n't argue with you . ''"
"pesh brought his mouth to hers ."
"as their lips moved against each other , he could n't believe how lucky he was ."
"megan was his-she was really going to be his for the rest of his life ."
"when she flicked her tongue against his , he groaned into her mouth ."
"considering they were at patrick 's with all of her family down the hall , he knew the last thing on his mind should 've been flipping her over onto her back and pounding into her ."
"but he did n't care ."
"he wanted inside her body ."
"he had finally made it into her heart , mind , and soul , and he once again wanted to be inside her perfection ."
"when megan pushed him onto his back , pesh raised his brows at her ."
"`` mmm , i think my future wife is getting ahead of herself ."
"usually the consummating comes after the wedding , not the engagement , '' he teased ."
"`` i think we 've consummated enough over the last few months where it does n't matter . ''"
"`` i suppose you 're right . ''"
"as she ground her core against his growing erection , she said , `` looks like i 'm not the only one with consummating on the mind . ''"
"`` you should know that has a mind of its own . ''"
"she grinned down at him ."
"`` well , right now i think we 're both of the same mind . ''"
"as she continued to grind against him , his hands swept to her br**sts ."
"he cupped and kneaded the flesh over her top ."
"at the sound of the door opening , pesh tried to pull away , but he did n't make it in time ."
"`` oh f**king hell ! ''"
"aidan 's voice boomed from the doorway ."
"megan quickly scrambled off pesh , and they both rose up , trying to straighten their clothes and hair ."
"with a pained expression , aidan said , `` seriously ?"
"this is my old bedroom ! ''"
"pesh chuckled ."
"`` i 'm sorry , but you of all people should understand that when the mood hits , you act on it . ''"
"megan smacked his arm playfully ."
"`` that is not exactly what happened . ''"
"holding up one of his hands , aidan said , `` frankly , i do n't really want to know what happened ."
"i just came back here to make sure megan was all right ."
"next time , i 'll make sure someone else comes , so i do n't need eye bleach to wipe that out of my memory."
"``"
"`` ha , ha , very funny , '' megan grumbled , as she got off the bed ."
"`` we were only celebrating , '' pesh said ."
"aidan pinched his eyes shut ."
"`` i do n't think i even want to know what you were celebrating . ''"
"`` our engagement , pervert , '' megan replied ."
"aidan 's blue eyes widened ."
"`` holy shit , you two are engaged ? ''"
"pesh smiled as he rose off the bed and took megan 's hand ."
"`` yes , we are ."
"well , i mean , i need to go to her father and properly ask for her hand ."
"and there 's the fact she does n't have a ring . ''"
"shaking his head in disbelief , aidan said , `` that 's ... wow ."
"i 'm so happy for you two . ''"
"`` thank you ."
"and i do mean that ."
"if it were n't for you and emma , i never would have met megan , '' pesh said ."
"aidan grinned as he clapped pesh on the back ."
"`` you 're more than welcome , man ."
"i 'm just so glad you two finally realized how good you were for each other . ''"
"he turned back to the door before motioning them ."
"`` come on , let 's go tell the others ."
"i think this calls for a celebration , but just not the kind that you two were partaking in . ''"
"megan shook her head ."
"`` we were n't going to tell anybody yet . ''"
"pesh nodded ."
"`` she does n't even have a ring . ''"
"aidan snorted ."
"`` do you really think anyone out there is going to give two shits about whether or not you have a ring ? ''"
"`` we just want to do it the right way , '' pesh replied ."
"holding up his hands in surrender , aidan said , `` all right , i 'm not going to argue with you anymore ."
"but i will say that there is no right way ."
"hell , look at me and em ."
"in the end , you have to go with the flow and appreciate the moments that are bigger than you could ever imagine . ''"
"he then turned and strode out of the bedroom ."
"pesh stole a glance at megan who appeared to be processing aidan 's words ."
"`` come on , we better get back out there before they send someone else , '' she finally said ."
"with a smile , he took her hand and led her down the hall ."
"when they got back to the dining room , everyone glanced expectantly at them ."
"even though he knew he should n't , pesh blurted , `` we 're engaged ! ''"
"he did n't have time to worry about megan 's anger about him blabbing because he realized she had said it at the same time he had ."
"cheers went up over the room , and he was hugged and kissed by megan 's aunts ."
"when megan 's father , paul , stood before him , pesh felt like he 'd been kicked in the groin ."
"`` mr. mckenzie , i apologize ."
"i intended to come to you and ask for megan 's hand-to show respect to you and your wife ."
"i 'm so sorry . ''"
"paul shook his head and smiled ."
"`` please do n't apologize ."
"i 'm just grateful that she 's met such a wonderful man who will be a good husband to her and a good father to mason . ''"
"`` i swear to you that i will . ''"
"he and paul shook hands to seal the vow ."
"in the absence of champagne , wine was poured to celebrate ."
"at the head of the table , patrick held up his glass ."
"`` to my granddaughter and the good doctor , i give you an irish marriage blessing ."
"'may god be with you and bless you ."
"may you see your children 's children ."
"may you be poor in misfortunes and rich in blessings ."
"may you know nothing but happiness from this day forward . '"
"''"
"he smiled ."
"`` to megan and pesh . ''"
"the others raised their glasses ."
"once pesh tasted the rich bouquet of the wine , he leaned over and kissed megan ."
"he did n't even mind the cat-calls and whistling-he was too happy to care ."
"chapter twenty-one standing in front of the lighted hotel mirror , megan surmised her appearance ."
"it was the first time she had n't been encircled by pesh 's mother , sister , and aunts since she had stepped inside the suite an hour ago ."
"when she had agreed to an indian engagement party , she had n't quite known what she was getting into ."
"she thought it would just be a great way to get their friends and family together ."
"she did n't know that pesh 's family did n't do anything on a modest scale ."
"without her input , the plaza ballroom of the ritz carlton in atlanta had been booked ."
"when she had dared a peek inside earlier , it had been transformed into something out of a bollywood movie ."
"she had wanted to honor pesh 's culture by dressing just as a true indian prospective bride would , so she had gone sari shopping with lavani and shveta ."
"what she had n't bet on was how gorgeously intricate the outfit would be ."
"now as she gazed at herself in the mirror , she was almost blinded by the glittering stones and beading on the deep purple and gold sari ."
"the outfit put even the blingiest miss america pageant dress to shame ."
"the top part was sleeveless , and it ended just below her br**sts ."
"while the front part appeared to be plain satin , the back was encrusted in beading and gems ."
"the skirt , with its beaded waistband , started just beneath her belly button and fell to the floor in the most exquisite silky material ."
"it was hard imagining she was going to be baring her mid-drift , as was the fashion of the sari ."
"thankfully , she had a jewel encrusted drape that slung across one of her shoulders and down one side ."
"earlier after one of pesh 's aunts had done her makeup , lavani and shveta did her hair ."
"the long strands were swept back and pinned on the side in loose curls ."
"a gorgeous purple orchid adorned the curls ."
"all that was missing from her ensemble was the jewelry that pesh 's family had requested that she wear ."
"apparently , it was all heirloom pieces and kept in a safe at a bank ."
"although the necklace and earrings were to come , her arms were heavy laden with bangle bracelets that lavani and shveta had put on her ."
"they both had tears in their eyes when they finished ."
"`` you look absolutely breathtaking , my dear , '' lavani said ."
"megan smiled ."
"`` thank you ."
"and thank you so much for making tonight happen . ''"
"lavani cupped her cheek ."
"`` i look forward to seeing many happy years between you and my alpesh ."
"i 'm grateful that you make him so happy ."
"it had been so long since i had seen a light in his eyes ."
"but when you came into his life , you brought back that light . ''"
"at lavani 's words , megan felt tears stinging her eyes ."
"`` thank you , '' she murmured ."
"when she felt like she could speak without crying , she brought her hands together as if she were praying and then bowed her head as was the sign of respect in pesh 's culture ."
"`` i want you to know that before pesh , i was in darkness , too ."
"he has become my light as well ."
"i can assure you that i will spend the rest of my life honoring him and making him happy ."
"i am very thankful for the amazing man you have raised . ''"
"lavani 's dark eyes filled with tears , and she brought a handkerchief up to dab her eyes ."
"`` thank you , my dear . ''"
"shveta stepped into the bathroom , her face lit up in a broad smile ."
"`` alpesh is here . ''"
"gathering up the bottom of her skirt , megan walked out of the bathroom and into the bedroom ."
"her heart stopped at the sight of him ."
"she had never seen him in kurta-pajama , as they were called ."
"basically , it was a long , tunic like shirt that came to his knees ."
"underneath he wore loose cotton-like pants ."
"but his top was made much like hers ."
"it was gold in color and encrusted in gems and beading ."
"she did n't want to begin to imagine how much it cost ."
"when she brought her gaze back to his , she shivered under his heated stare ."
"`` you are a vision of absolute and total perfection , '' he said ."
"doing a little turn , the fabric of her sari twirled around her ."
"`` so you like it ? ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` i love it . ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` i feel a little like a poser ."
"like 'you can put the irish girl in a sari , but you ca n't take the irish out of the girl ' kinda thing . ''"
"`` i would n't have you any other way , '' he said , with a serious , yet tender tone ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"megan eyed the two velvet boxes in his hand ."
"`` ooh , let me see the goodies . ''"
"with a bark of a laugh , pesh sat one of the boxes down on the table before he opened the other ."
"megan gasped as two enormous earrings glittered back at her ."
"while there was a thick base , the rest flowed down in flourishing designs that would probably touch her shoulders when she put them on ."
"they had a gold overlaying , but all the gems were diamonds and amethysts that would match her sari ."
"`` this is why your mother and shveta wanted me to pick a purple sari ? ''"
"she questioned ."
"pesh nodded ."
"`` they 're breathtaking , '' she murmured ."
"`` wait until you see the necklace , '' he replied , with a smile ."
"her shaky hands reached forward to take one of the earrings ."
"she quickly worked the clasp and fastened it to her lobe ."
"then she did the other ."
"while they were so heavy she felt like they might weigh her down , she glanced up at pesh and smiled ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"`` you 're welcome , my love . ''"
"he reached for the other box ."
"megan 's eyes widened as the diamonds and deep amethysts sparkled in the light ."
"he took the necklace out and unfastened the clasp ."
"he moved behind her and then lifted the necklace over her head ."
"she closed her eyes at the pleasurable sensation of feeling his closeness ."
"`` there ."
"now you 're ready . ''"
"whirling around to face him , she brought her lips to his ."
"`` i love you . ''"
"his thumb tenderly rubbed her cheek ."
"`` i love you , too . ''"
"from the doorway of the bedroom , lavani tsked disapprovingly at them ."
"`` alpesh , stop mauling her , or you 're going to mess up her makeup ! ''"
"pesh chuckled ."
"`` i hardly think i was mauling her . ''"
"she waved her hand dismissively ."
"`` come now ."
"it 's time we went downstairs . ''"
"after pesh held out his arm for her , megan slid hers through his ."
"`` do n't be nervous , '' he murmured into her ear ."
"`` i 'm not , '' she lied ."
"`` megan , i know you well enough by now that i know when you 're nervous ."
"you fidget and bite your lip . ''"
"`` sorry , '' she muttered , as they got onto the elevator ."
"considering it was packed with pesh 's family , megan kept her mouth shut about her nerves ."
"the last thing she wanted to do was to come off wrong in front of them ."
"when the doors opened , she drew in a couple of deep breaths to still her nerves ."
"there was a whole lot of pomp and circumstance that she did n't quite understand about how they were all supposed to enter ."
"she just tried not to mess up the part when she came in with her parents ."
"just like at a wedding reception , she and pesh sat at a table at the head of the room ."
"of course , she had n't quite prepared herself for the golden chairs that looked almost like thrones ."
"once everyone was assembled , pesh 's father got up to speak ."
"`` we are very grateful that you all could be with us this evening ."
"i know that with megan 's friends and family , as well as some of our son 's , there are a lot of you unacquainted with our culture ."
"i will try to explain to you what the proceedings are . ''"
"on the table in front of them were two flower wreaths that reminded her of the leis that you would see in hawaii ."
"they were in colors of white , gold , and purple ."
"the wreaths crisscrossed over the black ring boxes ."
"she knew from what pesh had told her that they would be giving each other rings tonight to symbolize their future union ."
"it all seemed pretty extreme to her for just an engagement party-it was almost like a wedding ."
"`` it 's show-time , '' pesh murmured in her ear before he stood up ."
"she quickly followed his lead ."
"he took one of the flower wreaths off the table and brought it over her head ."
"he made sure to adjust her hair so it flowed over the flowers ."
"when he was done , she did the same , although it was a little harder for her to reach up over his head ."
"then he took one of the platinum bands and put it on her trembling finger ."
"`` i love you so very much , megan ."
"there 's not another woman in the world i could love like i do you , '' he whispered to reassure her ."
"`` i love you so much , too . ''"
"she then slid the band on his hand ."
"once it was done , applause went out over the ballroom , and pesh pulled her to him for a kiss ."
"`` now what do we do ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he smiled at her ."
"`` we dance . ''"
"after exhaling the breath she had been holding , megan took pesh 's hand and let him lead her to the dance floor ."
"a song she had never heard before in her life began to play from the dj ."
"`` so what were you thinking when it came to the wedding ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` something small . ''"
"his brows rose in surprise ."
"`` really ?"
"i was thinking you would want to go all out . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` i just want something simple with our closest friends and family ."
"i do n't have to have something showy to make me happy . ''"
"he grinned ."
"`` you know that anything 'simple ' is not going to set well with my parents . ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` well , they 're just going to have to accept it . ''"
"`` we could just run off and get married in a cave in hawaii , '' he suggested ."
"`` that idea has potential , but i think as my parents ' only daughter , they would kill me if they did n't get to plan something . ''"
"his expression grew serious ."
"`` i do n't want us to have to wait much longer . ''"
"`` i agree ."
"i want to get married in the next couple of months . ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` good ."
"i 'm glad to hear that . ''"
"as megan glanced over to see her grandfather dancing with his lady friend , an idea popped into her head ."
"`` what if we got married in papa 's rose garden ? ''"
"`` it sounds like a beautiful place , but is there enough room ? ''"
"`` only our closest friends and family , remember ? ''"
"she insisted ."
"`` it could work . ''"
"`` so you like the idea ? ''"
"`` i do . ''"
"with a wink , he said , `` it makes sense considering you proposed to me at patrick 's house . ''"
"megan grinned ."
"`` that 's right ."
"it does . ''"
"`` think we can put it all together in two months ? ''"
"`` i do n't see why not . ''"
"he brought his warm lips to hers , and megan shivered in spite of the heat on the dance floor ."
"`` i ca n't wait to make you my wife , '' he murmured against her lips ."
"`` i 'm ready to make an honest man out of you , too . ''"
"pesh threw his head back and chuckled ."
"`` only you would say something like that . ''"
"`` hey , the truth is the truth . ''"
"the song ended , and pesh escorted her back to their table ."
"after they finished with the blessings from pesh 's family , dinner was served ."
"megan could n't believe all the food that was paraded by her ."
"she lost count on how many plates of delicious indian food she sampled ."
"by the time the desserts came out , she was thoroughly stuffed and could n't eat any ."
"`` let 's go mingle , '' she suggested when pesh also turned down any dessert ."
"`` sounds good to me , '' he said , before getting out of his chair ."
"they made their way through the maze of tables , talking to family and friends ."
"megan was introduced to so many of pesh 's relatives that she was sure she would never be able to remember them all ."
"when they finally got to the fitzgerald tables filled with her parents and aunts and uncles , she was thrilled when pesh took a seat across from aidan and emma ."
"after they had been talking for a while , emma turned aidan ."
"`` do you think noah 's okay ? ''"
"aidan smiled ."
"`` i 'm sure he 's fine , babe ."
"the sitter looked very qualified . ''"
"although emma nodded her head , megan could tell that she was n't convinced ."
"both mason and noah were upstairs in the hotel with babysitters outside of their family for the first time in their young lives ."
"megan shared a bit of emma 's apprehension , but when she had dropped mason off in the suite , he seemed to get along with the woman they had hired ."
"`` i might just go peek in on him ."
"you know , make sure she got him to sleep , '' emma said , rising out of her chair ."
"aidan shook his head and stood up ."
"`` you need to be off your feet ."
"you said yourself you were n't feeling too well before we left . ''"
"emma shot him a murderous look ."
"`` thanks for saying that in front of pesh and megan . ''"
"aidan gave them a sheepish grin ."
"`` sorry guys ."
"i hope it does n't ruin your fabulous party knowing that emma , at nine months pregnant and some change , was n't feeling wonderful . ''"
"megan laughed while pesh shook his head ."
"`` emma , if you want to go on upstairs and lie down , we wo n't be hurt ."
"i remember how awful it feels being overdue , '' megan said ."
"`` no , i 'm fine ."
"i want to stay , '' emma replied ."
"when aidan motioned for her to have a seat , she shook her head ."
"`` i need to go to the restroom . ''"
"`` you want me to go check on noah ? ''"
"emma sighed ."
"`` i 'm sure he 's fine or the sitter would have texted me ."
"i 'm just being overprotective . ''"
"aidan gave her a quick kiss ."
"`` love you , sweetheart . ''"
"she smiled at him ."
"`` i love you , too . ''"
"after she headed through the crowd to the bathroom , aidan began telling pesh some wild story from work that had pesh doubled over with laughter ."
"when emma returned , she did n't sit back down ."
"instead , she swayed back and forth on her feet next to her chair ."
"`` aidan , '' she said in a strained voice ."
"megan could n't help noticing how emma had paled considerably since her trip to the bathroom just a few minutes before ."
"he held up his finger ."
"`` one second , babe ."
"i got ta finish telling pesh this story . ''"
"`` but my water broke . ''"
"without taking his eyes off pesh , aidan slid his glass of water over to her ."
"`` here take mine . ''"
"if the situation had n't been dire , megan would have laughed at how oblivious aidan was ."
"pesh leaned forward in his seat ."
"`` um , aidan , i think- '' he did n't get a chance to finish ."
"instead , water splashed against the side of aidan 's face ."
"he shot out of his chair before whirling around to emma ."
"`` what the hell , em ? ''"
"`` my ."
"water ."
"broke , '' she muttered through gritted teeth ."
"`` oh shit , '' he replied ."
"after tossing his napkin back on the table , he held up a hand ."
"`` okay , it 's fine ."
"no need to panic ."
"we 're not that far from the hospital- '' `` like twenty minutes , '' emma argued ."
"aidan 's hands came to her shoulders ."
"`` it 'll be fine , babe ."
"i promise . ''"
"emma huffed out a few frustrated breaths as she weighed his words ."
"then her grim expression softened ."
"`` okay . ''"
"aidan grinned as he turned back to pesh and megan ."
"`` i hate to cut and run , but it looks like baby caroline is a big attention whore who wants all the glory tonight . ''"
"megan rose out of her chair ."
"`` do n't you worry about it one bit ."
"since she 's a week overdue , i 'm going to let her have this one without accusing her of trying to steal the limelight . ''"
"`` can we do anything ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"while aidan shook his head , emma said , `` just make sure noah is okay . ''"
"angie rose out of her chair ."
"`` i 'll go check on him right now . ''"
"emma smiled ."
"`` thanks . ''"
"aidan dug around in his pocket ."
"when he produced a set of keys , he tossed them at pesh ."
"`` since i came after work , em and i are in separate cars ."
"whoever has noah overnight will need our suv to get him to the hospital tomorrow . ''"
"pesh nodded as megan said , `` good thinking ."
"i 'm not sure if mom is taking him or becky . ''"
"at emma 's somewhat apprehensive look that there was n't a strict plan in place for noah , megan said , `` it 'll be fine ."
"i promise . ''"
"`` okay , '' she said , a little reluctantly ."
"sliding his arm around emma 's waist , aidan said , `` come on , sweetheart ."
"we need to go . ''"
"at the feel of pesh 's hand on her back , megan glanced up at him ."
"`` exciting night for them , eh ? ''"
"`` yes , it is . ''"
"`` how about letting me take you for another spin on the dance floor ? ''"
"`` i 'd love that . ''"
"as an indian love song flowed out from the speakers , megan wrapped her arms around pesh 's neck ."
"this time he did n't bother dancing more formally like he had in savannah ."
"instead , he wrapped his arms around her waist and drew her flush against him ."
"closing her eyes , she rested her head on his broad chest , loving the gentle beat of his heart beneath his shirt ."
"when the song finished , they did n't move ."
"they just waited for the next one ."
"thankfully , it was another slow one ."
"halfway through , she felt a tug on the bottom of her drape ."
"glancing down , she saw georgie peering up at her ."
"`` what are you doing , sweetie ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he glanced left and right before he spoke ."
"`` mommy told me not to tell anybody , but she needs you to come up to her hotel room . ''"
"`` okay ."
"what for ? ''"
"`` noah 's going crazy wanting aunt emma , and she thinks you 're the only one that might be able to get him to calm down . ''"
"`` ah , i see . ''"
"when she turned back to pesh , he smiled ."
"`` you do n't even need to apologize ."
"go see if you can help . ''"
"she leaned up and gave him a smacking kiss on the lips ."
"`` thank you for being so amazing each and every moment of the day . ''"
"his thumb brushed against her cheek ."
"`` you 're welcome , my love . ''"
"`` be back as soon as i can . ''"
"`` i 'm going to hold you to that . ''"
"taking georgie 's hand , she made her way off the dance floor and out of the ballroom ."
"after getting on one of the elevators , they rode to the sixth floor ."
"she let georgie lead the way ."
"he stopped halfway down the hall and knocked on the door ."
"by then , she did n't have to guess which room noah was in ."
"she could hear his screams all the way outside ."
"when becky flung open the door , she waved megan through with her hand ."
"`` the others did n't want me to interrupt you , but we 've been trying the last hour to get him to calm down , and he 's just not having it . ''"
"megan found the scene in hotel room somewhat comical ."
"her mother , along with her aunts julia and liz , stood in a circle around one of the beds ."
"outfitted in a fuzzy , blue footed sleeper , noah sat in the middle of the mattress , his cheeks streaked and soaked with tears and his face red from crying ."
"`` what is the matter ? ''"
"megan asked ."
"everyone whirled around to look at her ."
"`` nothing ."
"everything 's fine ."
"go back to your party , '' angie said , over noah 's wails ."
"`` um , i think it 's safe to say that it is n't fine ."
"or at least , he 's not fine . ''"
"liz fanned her face with her hand ."
"`` it 's like the moment emma left the hotel , he freaked out ."
"he woke up out of a dead sleep screaming for his mama ."
"the poor baby-sitter hung in as long as she could before she finally called us . ''"
"megan cocked her head at noah ."
"`` poor thing . ''"
"she bypassed her aunts to hold out her arms ."
"considering he 'd spent so much time with her , noah happily reached for her , and megan pulled him into her embrace ."
"`` hey buddy , you 've got to stop crying . ''"
"he was snubbing so hard his breath came in big hiccups as his chest heaved ."
"`` mama ."
"want mama , '' he pleaded pitifully ."
"megan hugged him tight to her chest ."
"`` i know , sweetie ."
"but she 's at the hospital having your baby sister . ''"
"her answer did n't satisfy him since he drew in a deep breath to start screaming again ."
"she smiled at him ."
"`` you wan na go downstairs to the party ? ''"
"he appeared thoughtful ."
"`` pesh is downstairs ."
"you wan na see him ? ''"
"`` esh ? ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` yes , he 's down there . ''"
"`` see esh , '' he said , kicking his feet as if to tell her to start walking ."
"`` here ."
"i 'll take him , '' her mother suggested , reaching for noah ."
"he shrieked before wrapping his arms tighter around megan 's neck ."
"`` i think it 's safe to say he 's staying with me . ''"
"`` but it 's your engagement party , '' julia protested ."
"`` yes , and i 've been enjoying it the last four hours ."
"i do n't think watching him is going to take away anything for me . ''"
"as she started out the doorway , she asked , `` is mason okay ? ''"
"her mother nodded ."
"`` thank goodness he 's down the hall , or we 'd have two toddlers running around at eleven o'clock . ''"
"megan giggled as she walked down the hall ."
"her necklace and the beaded sari seemed to be holding noah 's interest ."
"`` pretty , huh ? ''"
"she asked , as they got on the elevator ."
"`` ooh , pwetty , '' he mimicked ."
"when she got back downstairs , pesh was seated at their table , talking to some of their colleagues ."
"the moment noah saw him , he reached out for pesh ."
"`` well hello , little one ."
"were you really crying because you wanted to come to our party ? ''"
"noah grinned at pesh behind his pacifier , which caused pesh to smile ."
"`` he looks so much like aidan when he does that , does n't he ? ''"
"`` yes , he does ."
"i 'm sure he 's going to use that cute little grin to his advantage when he gets older , just like his daddy did . ''"
"she eased into the chair beside them ."
"after spitting out his pacifier , noah asked , `` daddy ? ''"
"`` uh , oh , i should n't have said that , '' megan muttered under her breath ."
"`` my daddy ? ''"
"`` he 's at the hospital with mommy ."
"we 'll take you there in the morning , '' she replied ."
"that statement caused noah 's lip to tremble ."
"before he could start crying , pesh rose out of his chair ."
"`` let 's go look at all the pretty party decorations . ''"
"megan smiled as she watched pesh take noah around the room ."
"her heart warmed at his thoughtfulness ."
"she could n't believe there was ever a time when she fought her feelings for him ."
"there was n't a better man in the whole world , and the fact that he loved her was a true miracle ."
"by the time pesh returned , noah had fallen asleep ."
"he carefully sat back down beside her ."
"`` here , '' she suggested , taking off her glittering drape ."
"she wrapped the fabric over noah like a blanket ."
"`` did i mention how much i loved you in a sari ? ''"
"pesh questioned , with a wicked gleam in his eyes ."
"she glanced down to see the top had her boobs bulging out the front as well as the fact her stomach was now bared ."
"`` i 'll have to wear one more often for you . ''"
"`` i would love that . ''"
"when her phone beeped , she reached across the table and grabbed it ."
"`` oh my god ! ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` that was aidan ."
"the baby is already here . ''"
"`` considering it 's a second baby , it is n't too surprising . ''"
"`` i need to tell my mom and aunts . ''"
"he nodded ."
"`` go ahead ."
"we 're fine . ''"
"megan smiled at noah sleeping soundly against pesh 's chest ."
"`` be right back . ''"
"she made her way over to her family 's table ."
"`` that was aidan ."
"caroline was just born . ''"
"a whoop went up around the table ."
"`` is emma okay ? ''"
"becky asked ."
"megan nodded ."
"`` he said mother and baby are doing great . ''"
"julia shook her head and smiled ."
"`` aidan with a daughter-now that 's going to be something to see . ''"
"they all laughed ."
"`` that 's so true , '' megan said ."
"becky glanced at the group ."
"`` why do n't we go see them ?"
"i mean , the hospital is n't too far from here . ''"
"angie nodded ."
"`` sounds good to me ."
"i 'd personally like to see aidan in action with his baby girl . ''"
"with a snort , megan added , `` i would have liked to have been in the delivery room when she was first born ."
"his expression then would have been priceless . ''"
"`` i bet he cried , '' liz said ."
"`` oh yeah , he bawled for sure , '' angie replied , with a grin ."
"as her aunts started gathering up their purses and telling their husbands where they were going , megan said , `` i want to go too . ''"
"before they could argue , she held up her hand ."
"`` it 's late ."
"the party is pretty much over , and there 's two more next week at some of pesh 's relatives ' houses ."
"besides , i want to see the newest fitzgerald baby girl . ''"
"her mother frowned ."
"`` are you sure ? ''"
"`` i 'm positive . ''"
"`` all right ."
"go tell pesh , and we 'll meet you out front . ''"
"she smiled as she went back to their table ."
"`` my mom and aunts are going to the hospital to see aidan and emma . ''"
"`` you want to go ? ''"
"her heart warmed at the fact that he already knew what she was feeling ."
"`` do you mind ? ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` of course not ."
"can i go too or is this just a hen party thing for the women ? ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` yes , you can come . ''"
"pesh glanced down at noah ."
"`` he 's going to want to see his mother . ''"
"`` oh yes ."
"i do n't think we could go without him . ''"
"as pesh rose out of the chair , noah stirred but did n't wake up ."
"`` get aidan and emma 's keys out of my pocket . ''"
"she nodded and reached into his pants ."
"when she accidentally touched his penis through the fabric , he jumped ."
"`` sorry about that , '' she replied , as she pulled out the keys ."
"`` no problem , '' he muttered through gritted teeth ."
"they said a quick goodnight to pesh 's parents and other relatives who remained ."
"then they headed out to the lobby ."
"after giving the valet aidan 's keys , they waited for the suv to be brought around ."
"when she caught her reflection in the glass doors of the hotel , she gasped ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"pesh inquired ."
"`` the jewelry !"
"i ca n't go loaded down with this expensive stuff to the hospital ! ''"
"she cried ."
"she snatched off the earrings and then started working on the necklace ."
"`` i 'll run go give it to your mother . ''"
"`` if you insist , '' pesh replied ."
"she kicked off her heels so she could run easier ."
"the necklace and earrings weighed down her hands ."
"she grabbed the first member of pesh 's immediate family she saw , which unfortunately happened to be dev ."
"`` can you get these to your mother ?"
"i 've got to get to the hospital . ''"
"his dark eyes widened as he took the jewelry from her ."
"`` are you okay ? ''"
"`` i 'm fine ."
"a cousin 's baby was just born ."
"do n't let anything happen to that , okay ? ''"
"dev chuckled ."
"`` yeah , i 'll be unloading this pronto ."
"the last thing i need is for my ass to be the one to lose the family jewels . ''"
"with a wink , he added , `` they 'd be taking my family jewels . ''"
"megan laughed and then gave him a wave before running off ."
"when she got back outside , aidan and emma 's suv had just pulled around ."
"noah began to squirm in pesh 's arms ."
"`` guess where we 're going ? ''"
"pesh said , before he could start crying ."
"`` mama ? ''"
"pesh smiled ."
"`` yes , we 're taking you to your mama and daddy and new baby sister . ''"
"noah 's face lit up at the prospect , and he happily let them buckle him into his car seat ."
"following her mother 's car , they made the drive in almost a caravan of relatives ."
"when they got to the hospital , pesh pulled up to let her out ."
"`` i 'll go park and bring him in . ''"
"`` okay ."
"i 'll see you guys up there . ''"
"when she got up to the maternity floor , there was a quite a group waiting for her , including emma 's best friend , connor ."
"`` did casey not feel like coming tonight ? ''"
"megan asked , as she hugged him ."
"casey was just a few weeks shy of her own due date with a little girl ."
"he chuckled ."
"`` oh , she 's here all right ."
"she 's just in labor herself ."
"it seems like caroline and olivia are going to be true best friends by being born almost the same day . ''"
"megan grinned ."
"`` that 's wonderful news . ''"
"connor wrinkled his nose ."
"`` i think casey will be appreciating it a little more when her epidural kicks in ."
"she was n't too happy the last time i went back to see her . ''"
"`` oh yes , i remember that feeling well . ''"
"megan 's phone dinged , and she quickly read the text ."
"`` aidan says we can come back now , '' she said to her aunts ."
"the group made their way through the double doors and down the hall ."
"when they reached emma 's room , angie knocked on the door ."
"within a few seconds , aidan appeared ."
"`` hey guys , '' he said , with a beaming smile ."
"`` the nurse is actually checking on em , but give me a second . ''"
"he disappeared back behind the door only to reappear within a few moments ."
"this time he held a tiny bundle wrapped in a pink blanket ."
"`` here she is ."
"miss caroline elizabeth fitzgerald . ''"
"collective oohs and aahs went up over the group as aidan held caroline out for them to see ."
"she did n't seem too interested or impressed by them ."
"she yawned and closed her eyes ."
"`` she 's absolutely beautiful , '' megan said ."
"`` she 's something all right , '' aidan murmured ."
"`` there it is !"
"i see a tear , '' becky teased ."
"aidan rolled his eyes at his sister ."
"`` let me guess ."
"you had some kind of bet going about whether i cried or not ? ''"
"liz patted his back ."
"`` something like that . ''"
"pesh appeared then ."
"the moment noah saw his father he kicked to get down ."
"once he got his feet on the floor , he ran to aidan , wrapping his arms around aidan 's leg ."
"`` hey buddy ."
"you want to meet your sister ? ''"
"squatting down , aidan held caroline to where noah could get a good look at her ."
"`` mama 's tummy baby ? ''"
"he questioned ."
"aidan laughed ."
"`` yeah , this is your baby sister , caroline . ''"
"noah eyed his sister with a slight frown , as if he was trying to figure her out ."
"megan could only imagine what was going on in his head at the moment ."
"he 'd spent the last sixteen months being the center of his parents ' world , and now there was someone else to share the attention ."
"when caroline scrunched up her face and whimpered , noah patted her arm ."
"`` no cwy , baby . ''"
"`` aw , he 's going to be a good big brother , '' angie remarked ."
"aidan chuckled ."
"`` yeah , he 'll be fine until caroline needs emma ."
"then he 's going to be ready to sell her to the gypsies . ''"
"a nurse exited emma 's room ."
"`` you can go in now . ''"
"as she gazed around the crowd , she shook her head ."
"`` well , some of you can go in . ''"
"rising up off the floor , aidan took noah 's hand ."
"`` come on , buddy ."
"mama wants to see you . ''"
"noah did n't bother waiting on aidan ."
"he barreled through the door ."
"`` mama !"
"mama ! ''"
"he cried ."
"megan smiled as she watched him climb up on emma 's bed ."
"`` there 's my baby boy ! ''"
"emma cried hoarsely , smothering both his cheeks in kisses ."
"he snuggled up to emma 's side ."
"`` come on , meggie ."
"you and pesh come in first , '' aidan suggested ."
"megan did n't argue with him ."
"instead , she took pesh 's hand and followed aidan inside ."
"emma glanced up and shook her head ."
"`` i 'm so sorry for ruining your engagement party . ''"
"`` you did n't ruin our night , '' pesh reassured her ."
"`` that 's right ."
"we kept right on partying-it did n't bother us at all , '' megan teased ."
"emma laughed ."
"`` i 'm glad to hear that . ''"
"megan smiled and jerked her chin over at aidan , who sat in the rocker with caroline ."
"`` congratulations on a beautiful baby girl . ''"
"`` thank you , '' emma replied , as a beaming smile lit up her face ."
"`` are you feeling okay ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"emma nodded ."
"`` it was a little easier this time and a lot quicker . ''"
"she turned to aidan ."
"`` and this time i did n't have to worry that aidan might not make it . ''"
"aidan chuckled ."
"`` no , you just kept screaming at me to drive faster because you were not going to deliver caroline on the side of the interstate . ''"
"emma 's cheeks flushed ."
"`` i guess i was a little panicked . ''"
"pesh took megan 's hand and squeezed it ."
"`` we better go and let the others have a turn , '' he said ."
"`` do you want us to take noah back with us ? ''"
"considering he was plastered to his mother 's side , megan was n't really looking forward to trying to take him ."
"emma gazed down at her son with love burning in her eyes ."
"`` no , i think he can stay here with us a little longer ."
"i might get connor to take him home ."
"i know he 'll be here until casey delivers . ''"
"`` are you sure you wo n't need your rest ? ''"
"megan asked ."
"`` oh , i 'll pawn him off to aidan and make sure i get plenty of sleep until miss caroline needs me , '' emma replied , with a sly smile ."
"aidan did n't argue with her ."
"he looked perfectly content to lose sleep if it meant being surrounded by his wife and children ."
"after exchanging a few hugs and kisses , she and pesh headed out into the hallway and let the next group in ."
"as they walked down the hall hand in hand , pesh turned to her and smiled ."
"`` you know , i never thought i would see the day i would be envious of aidan again . ''"
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"he heaved a sigh ."
"`` seeing him with his children makes me envious ."
"one day i hope that 's you with my child in your arms . ''"
"`` oh , '' she murmured ."
"whether or not they would have children together had never really been discussed ."
"it was almost a given that they would , so it did n't seem necessary to iron out when and how many ."
"she wanted nothing more than to give pesh a baby of his own ."
"he was truly the father mason had never had ."
"`` give me a year , '' she said softly ."
"his brows furrowed in confusion ."
"`` what ? ''"
"`` i 'd like one year for us to be together as a married couple before we try to have children . ''"
"`` that only makes me an even older father , '' he protested ."
"`` you 'll be fine ."
"you 're awfully spry for your old age . ''"
"he laughed ."
"`` i just do n't want to be on a walker at his or her high school graduation . ''"
"she smacked his arm playfully ."
"`` one year is not going to make that much a difference . ''"
"`` fine ."
"you win ."
"we 'll wait one year . ''"
"as the elevator doors dinged open , they stepped inside ."
"gazing down at her , pesh said , `` i could n't have picked a more amazing mother for my future children . ''"
"`` yeah , i got ta agree that you did good , nadeen ."
"real good , '' she teased ."
"he cupped her face in his hands and gave her a lingering kiss that silenced anymore of her comebacks ."
"when he pulled away , she smiled at him ."
"`` keep kissing me like that , and i might decide to wait even longer for a baby ."
"you 'll make me want you , your lips , and your dick all to myself for as long as possible . ''"
"`` and here i thought my kisses might get you in the mood for baby-making , '' pesh mused ."
"megan laughed ."
"`` either way , it 's a win-win situation ."
"so bring it on , nadeen ."
"bring ."
"it ."
"on . ''"
"chapter twenty-two although her stomach screamed in protest to drop her fork , megan could n't resist popping in the last bite of delicious crepe into her mouth ."
"as she chewed , she closed her eyes at the delicious combination of chocolate and strawberries danced along her taste buds ."
"`` good ? ''"
"a voice asked from across the table ."
"her eyelids popped open to take in pesh , her new husband of three days ."
"he wore an amused smile as he held his cappuccino cup in midair ."
"`` orgasmically good , '' she replied ."
"he chuckled ."
"`` i 'm glad you 're enjoying them . ''"
"`` i 'm going to gain ten pounds while we 're here , '' she replied ."
"as she dabbed her mouth with her napkin , she sighed with absolute contentment ."
"gazing around the tiny parisian cafe , she fought the urge to pinch herself ."
"was she actually in paris on her honeymoon ?"
"when pesh had asked her where she wanted to go , there was only one place ."
"although it was somewhat cliched for a honeymoon destination , she had always wanted to see the city ."
"and because she was marrying a man who loved to spoil her , pesh had booked them for a week 's stay at the hotel plaza athenee ."
"not only had he chosen the hotel for its gorgeous views of the eiffel tower , but it was also where carrie bradshaw stayed when she was in paris ."
"it seems pesh completely understood megan 's love for sex and the city ."
"their first day in the city had been spent in their hotel room ."
"a combination of jetlag and lust had kept them na**d and in bed , stopping only for room service and showers ."
"today they had pried themselves away from the room to go sightseeing ."
"`` are you ready to go back to the hotel ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"`` maybe . ''"
"with a teasing grin , she asked , `` are you tired and want to rest ? ''"
"desire pooled in pesh 's dark eyes ."
"`` no , i do n't want to rest ."
"i want you to model what you bought this afternoon . ''"
"her gaze left his to go down to the pink and black bag at her feet ."
"part of their sightseeing had turned into shopping , in which she bought some very racy lingerie ."
"although she was enjoying her day out in the city , she was also itching to put on the outfit and get back in bed with pesh ."
"`` then let 's go , '' she said ."
"pesh certainly did n't need any more convincing ."
"digging in his pocket , he took out his wallet and threw a wad of euros on the table ."
"then he popped out of seat like a jack-in-the-box ."
"she had to snatch up her purse and bag to keep up with him before he sprinted out the door and into the sunshine ."
"as she passed the colorful flowers in bloom outside the cafe , they transported her back to her wedding ."
"it had been a perfect , cloudless day when she stood with pesh in the rose garden at her papa 's house ."
"to her , he had never looked more handsome than in his black tux that fit his built frame like a second skin ."
"since she was the master of party planning , megan had enlisted emma 's help in getting the quickie wedding done ."
"even with newborn caroline to tend to , emma had gone above and beyond any expectations megan had ."
"tears had stung her eyes when she first caught sight of the garden as she , on her father 's arm , made her way from the house to the ceremony ."
"white chairs draped with blue silk bunting lined the garden in rows while a tent had been erected to the side of the makeshift altar ."
"next to the chairs , votive candles lit the way up the aisle that was adorned in multicolored rose petals ."
"emma , casey , and two of her best friends from childhood stood at the altar in their cornflower blue bridesmaid dresses ."
"pesh , along with his brothers and aidan , wore blue vests with their tuxes ."
"a string quartet struck up the bridal march to herald her arrival ."
"she would never , ever forget the feeling of walking up the aisle to pesh ."
"his loving gaze took her in , and she felt like the princess she had always wanted to be on her wedding day ."
"her dress was almost like what a disney princess might wear-a long train , a full ball gown , a bodice encrusted with pearls and sequins , and then a glittering tiara holding her veil in place ."
"the entire world seemed to evaporate when pesh took her hand in his ."
"he was her only focus ."
"she barely heard the words the priest spoke or the lyrics of the song that emma sang ."
"she just stared at her soon-to-be husband-the man who made her believe in romance and true love ."
"she was so lost in thoughts of her wedding day that she accidentally mowed into a woman ."
"`` excuse me , '' she apologized ."
"the woman scowled at her while cursing at megan in french ."
"well , megan imagined it was cursing since she did n't speak french ."
"`` where is that head of yours ? ''"
"pesh asked , with a smile ."
"`` thinking of our wedding day , '' she replied ."
"his smile grew broader at her response , and in the middle of a crowded street , he stopped to kiss her ."
"while it was somewhat chaste and full of more love than lust , it did hold a promise of what was to come later on ."
"he ended it far sooner than she would like ."
"`` let 's hurry , '' he replied ."
"she giggled before breaking into a slight run towards the hotel ."
"he followed her example ."
"by the time they pushed through the revolving doors into the lobby , they were both breathless ."
"like two mischievous kids , they raced to the elevators ."
"once inside , they wrapped their arms around each other and kissed passionately until the door dinged open ."
"they pulled apart long enough to get down the hall and into their suite ."
"when the door closed behind them , pesh pulled her to him , bestowing a lingering kiss on her lips ."
"as he ravaged her mouth , his tongue darted inside to tease along hers ."
"when she felt his evident desire poking into her stomach , she broke the kiss ."
"at his groan , she shook her head ."
"`` not yet ."
"i have to get dressed . ''"
"`` next time , '' he muttered ."
"pushing out of his arms , she grinned up at him ."
"`` i 'll be back in just a second ."
"you get ready . ''"
"`` oh , i 'll be ready ."
"that 's a promise . ''"
"she laughed and then practically skipped into the bathroom ."
"once she closed and locked the door , she sat the bag down and dug inside ."
"after she decided what to wear , she laid them out on the counter , and then started taking off her clothes ."
"when she was naked , she reached for the lingerie ."
"the tight bodice was solid black with pink ribbons that wove through making intricate designs ."
"it pushed her br**sts up and over the cups , making her appear to have far more cle**age than she was blessed with ."
"the black and pink panties were lace and practically see through ."
"on her legs , she slid black silk stockings that had pink bows at the tops of her thighs ."
"as she fluffed out her hair , she could n't help gazing in the mirror ."
"she looked quite the sexpot , which she hoped pleased pesh ."
"well , she knew it would please pesh ."
"the man was ravenous for her , something for which she was very thankful ."
"not quite the polite gentleman she had expected when she first met him , that was for sure ."
"megan opened the bathroom door ."
"across the room , pesh stood gazing out the window , stripped down to his boxer shorts ."
"when she cleared her throat , he jerked his head to stare at her ."
"slowly , she walked out of the bathroom ."
"her eyes stayed on him ."
"a shiver rippled through her as he tracked her every move ."
"when she finally stood before him , it took less than a second for him to pounce on her ."
"his hands grabbed her by the waist , jerking her flush against him ."
"his mouth bore down on hers in a frantic kiss as he ground his c**k between her legs ."
"breathless , she pulled away to gaze up at him ."
"`` does this mean you like the lingerie ? ''"
"`` oh hell yes , i do ."
"i think we 're going to have to go back and get you some more . ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` more shopping ?"
"you wo n't hear me say no to that . ''"
"bending over , pesh brought his arm under her knees and then lifted her up ."
"she felt so light in his arms as he walked her over to the bed and gently deposited her on the mattress ."
"as he loomed over her , her heartbeat sped up in anticipation the sensual delicacies she was about to experience ."
"tugging on the straps of the bodice , he bared her br**sts ."
"his mouth hovered over her nipple , breathing warm air onto the cool tip ."
"it puckered under his attention before his tongue darted out and flicked it ."
"`` mmm , '' she murmured , her fingers tightening in his hair ."
"making slow circles around her nipple , pesh continued his teasing assault ."
"arching her back , she gripped the strands of his hair tighter , willing him to take her nipple in his whole mouth ."
"finally , he obliged her , sucking the hardened peak into his mouth ."
"while he gave oral attention to one breast , his hand palmed and stroked the other ."
"as the heat and moisture built in her core , megan began sawing her legs back and forth ."
"the friction eased her a little , but she wanted pesh 's fingers , tongue , and dick there more than anything ."
"over the fabric of her bodice , he kissed down her stomach ."
"just as he reached the juncture between her legs , he bypassed it and began kissing and licking the exposed skin on her upper thighs ."
"she groaned in protest ."
"he gazed up at her with a teasing smile ."
"`` did you want me to kiss you somewhere else ? ''"
"raising her hips , she replied , `` you know where i want you-where i want all of you . ''"
"`` patience , my love . ''"
"`` oh really ? ''"
"she muttered ."
"with one quick movement , she was out from underneath him in a flash ."
"surprise filled his face as she flipped him over onto his back and straddled him once again ."
"raking her fingernails down his chest , she stopped just at the waistband of his boxers ."
"as his breath hitched , her hands went to his thighs , scraping a trail up the exposed skin to his dick ."
"his h*ps bucked up , causing her to smile ."
"`` oh , did you want me to touch you somewhere else ? ''"
"with a growl , he gripped her by the ass and forced her onto her knees ."
"he slid down the mattress to where her core was right at his mouth ."
"his tongue flicked out , sliding along the thin scrap of her panties ."
"she gasped as he flattened his tongue and rubbed it over her clit ."
"even through the fabric , it lit her on fire ."
"as he added more pressure , she began to rock her h*ps against his face ."
"closing her eyes , she concentrated on the feel of tongue ."
"when he pulled away , she whimpered ."
"his lips came to kiss along her thighs again ."
"just as pesh 's teeth dug into one of the bows on her stockings , megan 's ringtone for mason blared out over her frustrated breaths ."
"pesh protested the interruption with a grunt , but immediately let the stocking fall from his mouth ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"it 's his bedtime call ."
"i have to take it , '' megan said , as she sat up in the bed ."
"`` it 's all right , my love ."
"i 'm the one with patience , not you , '' he replied , with a smile ."
"she rolled her eyes at him as she grabbed the phone off the nightstand and answered it ."
"`` hey baby , '' she said , trying to catch her breath ."
"`` hi mommy ."
"miss you . ''"
"her heart warmed hearing his tiny voice while an ache filled her chest ."
"`` oh , i miss you too , sweet boy ."
"are you being good for grammy ? ''"
"`` uh-huh ."
"pway with noah today . ''"
"`` did you ?"
"did you have fun ? ''"
"`` uh-huh ."
"but caowine cwies . ''"
"megan laughed at his summation of the latest fitzgerald family member ."
"`` i bet she does ."
"she 's a little baby , and they do like to cry ."
"you cried a lot when you were that age . ''"
"`` where daddy ? ''"
"glancing at pesh , megan smiled ."
"`` he 's right here ."
"you want to talk to him ? ''"
"`` uh-huh . ''"
"megan handed the phone to pesh ."
"his face lit up as he said , `` hey buddy , how are you ? ''"
"as mason rattled along to pesh , megan could n't help thinking of how happy mason had been on her wedding day ."
"he had played his part as ring bearer wonderfully ."
"everyone commented on how handsome he was in small tux and how much he looked like her ."
"he was so excited to have a daddy and to be part of a real family ."
"he did n't even seem to mind that they were moving away from his grandparents into pesh 's house ."
"of course , pesh had sweetened the moving angst by having a black lab puppy , just like beau , waiting for mason in his new room ."
"he had squealed so loud that megan thought her ear drums were going to burst ."
"`` oh , so beau two pee-peed on grammy 's rug , huh ? ''"
"pesh asked , throwing megan an `` oh shit '' look ."
"while they were away , angie was in charge of both mason and the puppy , who mason had aptly named beau two after his first love , beau ."
"megan could imagine her mother was fit to be tied with her rugs being christened by puppy piss ."
"`` okay , you better go to bed now ."
"mommy and i miss you very , very much ."
"we 're bringing you lots of presents home . ''"
"at mason 's reply , tears shimmered in pesh 's eyes ."
"`` i love you , too , buddy , '' he replied , in a choked voice ."
"`` say goodnight to mommy , '' he replied , thrusting the phone at megan ."
"a sheepish expression came over pesh 's face as he ground the moisture from his eyes with his fists ."
"megan took the phone ."
"`` night , night , mommy ! ''"
"mason called ."
"`` night , night , baby ."
"you have sweet dreams , and i 'll talk to you tomorrow . ''"
"`` okay ."
"wuv you ! ''"
"she smiled ."
"`` i love you , too . ''"
"after megan hung up , she still cradled the phone to her ear as if by doing that , she was able to have mason a little closer ."
"pesh 's hand came to rest on hers ."
"`` he 's something , is n't he ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` yes , he is , '' she murmured ."
"`` i know it makes me a complete pansy , but every time he tells me he loves , i ca n't help but cry . ''"
"putting her phone back on the nightstand , megan eased herself over onto pesh 's lap ."
"`` do n't you ever worry that i think you 're a pansy because of what you feel for mason ."
"it makes me love you even more . ''"
"brushing her hand across his cheek , she added , `` a man who is n't afraid of showing his emotions or his vulnerability is very sexy . ''"
"`` you think so ? ''"
"`` mmm , i do . ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` i 'm glad to hear you say that . ''"
"`` where were we ? ''"
"glancing down at his crotch , pesh said , `` i think we 're starting over from my perspective . ''"
"megan 's hand went to cup his now deflated erection ."
"she rubbed him over the boxers before dipping her hand inside to grip him ."
"pesh hissed in a breath ."
"his head fell back against the headboard as she started stroking his growing length ."
"sliding down his body , she brought her hand to his lap and took him into her mouth ."
"her tongue teasingly flicked across the tip ."
"pesh 's hand came to tangle in her hair ."
"she did leisurely strokes up and down his length before bringing him into her mouth ."
"as she began bobbing up and down , pesh 's groans echoed through the room ."
"as she cut her gaze up to him , he glanced down at her with hooded eyes ."
"`` so good , baby ."
"so , so good , '' he murmured ."
"when he started tensing up , she let him fall free of her mouth ."
"`` i want you to come inside me , '' she said , as she climbed up his body ."
"rising up on her knees , she brought pesh 's hands to the elastic band of her underwear ."
"he tore them off her h*ps and down her thighs ."
"somehow she managed to get them off and toss them to the floor beside the bed ."
"leaving on the bustier , she guided his erection to her core ."
"slowly , she eased down on him , inch by inch ."
"when he was balls deep inside her , she sat back on his thighs ."
"raising her knees , she placed both her feet flat on the mattress ."
"from this position , she was giving pesh quite the view as she rose on and off of him ."
"as the pressure began building inside her , the more frantic her movements became ."
"harder and harder she bounced , the sound of skin slapping along with grunts and panting echoing through the room ."
"when pesh 's fingers came to tease her clit , she came undone , crying out and collapsing onto his chest ."
"he continued raising his h*ps to pump into her until he came a few moments later ."
"brushing the hair out of her face , pesh stared up at megan with a satisfied expression ."
"she brought her lips to his for a gentle kiss ."
"`` i love you , mr ."
"nadeen . ''"
"`` do you ? ''"
"she bobbed her head ."
"`` i love you and your talented fingers and dick , all of who give me wonderful orgasms . ''"
"he barked out a laugh ."
"`` i 've married such a naughty girl , have n't i ? ''"
"`` yes , you have . ''"
"`` i would n't have you any other way , my love . ''"
"megan smiled as he slid free of her body ."
"easing her onto her side , pesh spooned up behind her , nuzzling his face in her neck ."
"`` rest now , '' he said , drowsily ."
"`` yes , you need your rest ."
"i 'm going to want more of you in a little while . ''"
"his chuckle made her tingle with love and lust ."
"with the feel of his arm wrapped around her , megan let her drooping eyes close and drifted off to a contented sleep ."
"chapter twenty-three as they sat outside the courtroom waiting to be called in , megan adjusted mason 's blue and white striped tie for the hundredth time ."
"`` mommy , no , '' he pleaded ."
"she snatched her hands away ."
"`` i 'm sorry , sweetheart ."
"i 'll leave you alone . ''"
"`` tank you , '' he replied , going back to his game on his tablet ."
"the truth was her nervous hands needed to be doing something ."
"sensing her need , pesh reached over and took her hands in his ."
"`` relax ."
"everything is going to be fine . ''"
"megan wanted to believe him , but she could n't help feeling anxious ."
"she would n't be able to calm down until the ink had dried on the paperwork ."
"her feet , encased in black heels , tapped anxiously on the floor ."
"the clattering noise echoed around the atrium ."
"as she glanced between pesh and mason , megan had to smile ."
"the two men in her life looked almost identical today in their navy suits and ties ."
"of course mason 's was considerably smaller than pesh 's ."
"when the door opened and a clerk poked her head out the door , megan 's heartbeat started thrumming faster and faster ."
"`` megan nadeen ? ''"
"she shot off the bench ."
"`` that 's us ."
"i mean , i 'm megan nadeen . ''"
"the clerk smiled ."
"`` you guys can come in now . ''"
"taking a deep breath , megan reached for mason 's hand ."
"`` this is it , baby . ''"
"he grinned and then glanced up at pesh ."
"`` you be my daddy now ? ''"
"pesh smiled ."
"`` yes , i 'm going to be your daddy for real now . ''"
"they walked through the massive doors of the courtroom ."
"the judge , in his ominous black robe , gazed down at them from his bench ."
"`` good morning , '' he said , politely ."
"`` g-good morning , '' megan stammered ."
"`` i understand that we 're here today to petition for the adoption of the minor child , mason patrick mckenzie ? ''"
"`` yes , '' megan and pesh replied ."
"`` first , we need to swear you all in , '' the judge said ."
"megan went through the motions of the procedure , trying desperately to calm her nerves ."
"when pesh had first broached the subject of formally adopting mason , she initially had been thrilled and honored ."
"but then she had to worry about whether davis would allow pesh to adopt mason or not ."
"although he still had nothing to do with his son , davis had n't shown a lot of enthusiasm about the prospect ."
"the closer they got to the adoption hearing , the more megan worried that he would refuse ."
"`` dr. nadeen , i understand that you wish to adopt the minor child of your wife ? ''"
"pesh nodded enthusiastically ."
"`` yes , your honor , i would . ''"
"`` i see that you and your wife have been married less than two months , and that you 've only known her a year . ''"
"the judge adjusted his glasses that had slid down his pointy nose ."
"`` do you think it wise to legally bind yourself to this child after such a short time ? ''"
"megan fought the urge to stalk up to the bench and smack the judge ."
"instead , she took deep breaths and tried to reign in her temper ."
"she glanced over at pesh who merely smiled pleasantly at the judge ."
"`` your honor , i realize that on paper it might seem as though i am rushing into things ."
"however , i 've never been more certain of anything in my life as i am about my love for megan and in turn , my love for mason ."
"i 've waited a long time to be a father , and i do n't want to have to waste another second . ''"
"`` i see . ''"
"the judge eyed the folder open before him ."
"`` i understand the biological father has had no contact with the child . ''"
"`` that 's correct , '' megan replied ."
"`` he has also waved his parental rights so that dr. nadeen can adopt his son . ''"
"megan exhaled a relieved breath that davis had signed the paperwork ."
"`` i 'm glad to hear that , your honor , '' she said ."
"`` do you feel that your husband will make a good father for your son ? ''"
"`` i never would have dated , least of all married him , if i did n't believe that pesh would be a good and loving father to mason . ''"
"`` so the fact that he is a wealthy doctor had nothing to do with it ? ''"
"`` how dare you ! ''"
"megan cried ."
"when pesh grabbed her arm to silence her , she slung him away ."
"`` you 've known us for two minutes and you 're making assumptions about me , my husband , and my marriage ?"
"if this were about money , i could have used his father for child support considering he is a wealthy nfl player ."
"but i would have sacrificed everything to ensure that my son had a good father ! ''"
"`` mrs. nadeen , i will ask that you control yourself , or i will have to hold you in contempt , '' the judge said sternly ."
"pesh wrapped his arm around her waist , drawing her against him ."
"`` easy , '' he murmured ."
"although she hated to do it , she said , `` i 'm sorry , your honor . ''"
"when he smiled at her , she gasped in surprise ."
"`` and i am sorry for rattling you , mrs. nadeen ."
"i often say or do unorthodox things to see the true nature of the people who come before me . ''"
"`` you mean , you said that to get a reaction from me ? ''"
"`` yes , i did ."
"and you unwaveringly rose to my challenge ."
"i can see that you are truly concerned with the wellbeing of your son . ''"
"still reeling from the judge 's behavior , megan mumbled , `` thank you . ''"
"peering down over the bench , the judge surmised mason ."
"`` son , do you know why you 're here today ? ''"
"`` i gettin ' 'dopted , '' mason replied ."
"the judge smiled ."
"`` yes , you are ."
"do you want pesh to be your daddy ? ''"
"`` uh , huh . ''"
"`` do you want anyone else to be your daddy ? ''"
"`` no , '' mason replied quickly , shaking his head back and forth ."
"`` then come up here while i sign the paperwork . ''"
"mason happily ran around the side of the bench to the judge ."
"he climbed up onto the judge 's lap ."
"after signing several sets of papers , the judge handed mason his gavel ."
"`` once you bang that gavel , pesh is officially your daddy , and you are mason nadeen . ''"
"with a broad grin , mason brought the gavel down ."
"tears stung megan 's eyes , and she gladly let pesh pull her into his arms ."
"`` thank you , thank you , thank you , '' she murmured ."
"`` i love you , '' he replied , squeezing her tight ."
"`` i love you , too . ''"
"their attention was drawn to where mason kept banging the gavel ."
"the judge chuckled ."
"`` okay , i think that is enough ."
"why do n't you go to your mommy and daddy now ? ''"
"`` tell the judge thank you , '' megan instructed ."
"`` tank you , '' mason replied , before he hopped off the judge 's lap and came running to them ."
"`` i 'dopted !"
"i 'dopted ! ''"
"pesh bent down to pick him up ."
"`` that 's right , buddy ."
"you 're my son for now and always . ''"
"megan smiled and patted mason 's back as they started out of the courtroom ."
"`` come on ."
"let 's go to papa 's ."
"we 've got a big party for you there . ''"
"mason 's face lit up ."
"`` ice cweam ?"
"`` oh yes , there 's lots of ice cream just for you . ''"
"`` yay ! ''"
"he cried ."
"when they drove up at patrick 's , megan did a double take at the sight of an inflatable bouncy castle out on the lawn ."
"john , percy , and georgie were already making good use of it ."
"`` emma , the party planning monster has struck again , '' she mused ."
"pesh chuckled as he got out of the car ."
"he went to get mason while she started into the house ."
"balloons and flowers filled the foyer and living room ."
"over the dining room archway , there was a giant congratulations mason sign ."
"when she got to the kitchen , she sucked in a breath at the sight of all the catering pans ."
"`` emma fitzgerald , what have you done ? ''"
"she questioned ."
"at the sound of megan 's voice , emma jumped ."
"clutching her chest , she whirled around ."
"`` okay , so maybe i found a really excellent deal on the bouncy castle ."
"like ridiculously cheap . ''"
"megan crossed her arms over her chest ."
"`` the food ?"
"i thought mom and my aunts were cooking . ''"
"holding up one hand , emma replied , `` just williamson brothers bbq ."
"nothing fancy . ''"
"`` anything else i need to know about ?"
"live band or celebrity bursting out of a cake ? ''"
"emma giggled ."
"`` nope ."
"that 's it . ''"
"megan watched emma bustle around the kitchen , setting up the plates and cutlery ."
"`` um , is there anything i can do ?"
"i mean , i feel pretty shitty considering this is my son 's adoption party , '' megan said , with a smile ."
"pink tinged emma 's cheeks ."
"`` i 'm sorry . ''"
"megan threw her arms around emma and squeezed her tight ."
"`` do n't be sorry ."
"you 're amazing to do all of this for us . ''"
"emma smiled ."
"`` you 're more than welcome ."
"i 'm so happy for you and pesh and for mason . ''"
"`` thank you . ''"
"when megan pulled away , emma said , `` oh , there is something you can do ."
"go tell aidan we 're about to start ."
"he went to get caroline up from her nap . ''"
"`` sure ."
"i 'll be happy to . ''"
"as megan started down the familiar hallway , she stopped outside of aidan 's boyhood bedroom ."
"through the crack in the door , she could see him walking around the room , bouncing caroline in his arms ."
"at the sound of his singing , she had to stifle a laugh ."
"ankle was many things , but a singer was n't one of them ."
"`` sweet caroline , dum , dum , dum ."
"good times never seemed so good , '' he crooned off-key ."
"when megan pushed open the door , aidan jumped ."
"`` um , hey , '' he said , a flush entering his cheeks ."
"`` i never really pictured you as a neil diamond fan , '' she said , with a smile ."
"`` yeah , well , sweet caroline seems like the right thing to sing to her . ''"
"he cleared his throat ."
"`` what are you doing in here ? ''"
"`` emma wanted me to come get you . ''"
"`` oh , '' he said ."
"in his arms , caroline began to whimper , her little fists flailed ."
"`` shh , it 's okay , sweet pea ."
"where was i ? ''"
"`` i 've been inclined , '' megan answered him ."
"`` right , '' he said , over caroline 's cries ."
"when he picked back up with the song , megan said , `` that 's really unfair to torture her like that . ''"
"as aidan scowled at megan , caroline began to quiet ."
"aidan 's expression then turned triumphant ."
"`` see ?"
"she likes it when i sing to her . ''"
"`` but you ca n't sing , '' megan protested ."
"aidan shrugged ."
"`` it does n't matter to her . ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` she has a mother with a killer voice , yet she likes to listen to you ? ''"
"flashing his signature cocky grin , aidan replied , `` what can i say ?"
"all women love me . ''"
"with a roll of her eyes , megan said , `` give me a break . ''"
"glancing down at caroline , aidan said in a sing-song voice , `` do n't you have the sweetest , handsomest , and most wonderful daddy in the whole wide world ? ''"
"caroline cooed at his question and kicked her legs ."
"`` she 's a smart girl because she knows how lucky she is . ''"
"`` you 're terrible , '' megan said , with a grin ."
"aidan looked from his daughter over to megan ."
"`` you want to hold my most perfect little princess ? ''"
"`` i would love to . ''"
"she held out her arms as aidan passed caroline to her ."
"outfitted in a frilly purple dress and purple bow , caroline looked like she could be modeling baby wear ."
"unlike noah 's strawberry blond hair , hers was a deep auburn ."
"she had also inherited her mother 's green eyes ."
"`` i have to agree that you 're a lucky girl because you look just like your mother , '' megan said ."
"aidan laughed ."
"`` yeah , she is a little mini-emma , is n't she ? ''"
"`` she is ."
"boy , she 's going to give you hell when she 's a teenager , '' megan teased ."
"`` i know ."
"trust me , i know . ''"
"as caroline smiled up at her , megan could n't help sighing ."
"`` you 're a bad influence , missy ."
"you make me want to have another baby . ''"
"`` is that a bad thing ? ''"
"aidan asked ."
"`` no , it 's just ... '' `` just what ? ''"
"`` i asked pesh to give me a year of marriage before we start trying ."
"i know he 's ready right now , but i just want this time with him ."
"you know , just the two of us . ''"
"`` that 's understandable . ''"
"`` but holding her ... '' megan shook her head ."
"`` you 're just bad for business , miss caroline . ''"
"aidan laughed ."
"`` tell me about it ."
"whenever i hold her or noah , i think how much i 'm going to miss it when they 're not babies anymore ."
"it nags at me enough that i think i 'll be okay if we have more . ''"
"`` no vasectomy on the horizon ? ''"
"he grinned ."
"`` no yet ."
"still not ruling it out though ."
"and as far as you and more babies , you 'll know when the time is right ."
"and if anyone is patient and understanding , it 's pesh . ''"
"`` that 's true , '' megan murmured ."
"mason appeared in the doorway then ."
"`` 'mon , mommy ."
"want ice cweam ! ''"
"megan laughed ."
"`` okay , let me give your little bad influence back to you , '' she said , handing caroline to aidan ."
"she then took mason 's hand and started out of the bedroom ."
"`` daddy says i have ice cweam first . ''"
"`` did he ? ''"
"megan said , as she planned to strangle pesh ."
"`` uh huh ."
"'cause it 's my 'doption day . ''"
"when she met pesh 's eye , she raised her brows ."
"immediately , his face flushed ."
"`` spoiling him rotten already , are n't you ? ''"
"she questioned in a low voice ."
"`` i could n't help it ."
"it 's a special day . ''"
"`` mmm , hmm , and when this special day turns into an all nighter because he 's hyped on sugar , you 're going to deal with him . ''"
"pesh grinned ."
"`` i will ."
"i promise . ''"
"megan leaned up to kiss him ."
"`` you 're too sweet for your own good ."
"you 're always going to have me playing bad cop when it comes to discipline . ''"
"`` but you love me anyway , right ? ''"
"he murmured against her lips ."
"`` so much i was almost ready to reconsider our plan about when we 're starting a family . ''"
"his eyes bulged at her response ."
"it took him a few moments to speak ."
"`` that means a lot that you would do that , but deep down i know how you really feel ."
"so , i 'm going to be good and patiently wait ten more months before confiscating your birth control . ''"
"`` it 's a deal , '' she replied , before kissing him again ."
"epilogue as soon as he finished with his last patient , pesh practically sprinted from the exam room ."
"he hustled into the doctors ' lounge , trying hard to keep his head down and not call any attention to himself ."
"he wanted to be able to get out the door without anyone calling him back for a consult or to pull a longer shift ."
"once he had retrieved his things , he started for the parking lot ."
"`` dr ."
"nadeen ! ''"
"kristi called ."
"inwardly , he groaned ."
"`` yes ? ''"
"he questioned , as he turned around ."
"`` you were n't leaving , were you ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he exhaled a defeated breath ."
"`` i was planning on it ."
"does someone need me to cover for them ? ''"
"kristi winked at him ."
"`` thought you were screwed there for a minute , did n't you ? ''"
"a relieved laugh escaped his lips ."
"`` i did . ''"
"she smiled ."
"`` i have something for megan . ''"
"`` honestly kristi , you did n't need to do anything else for us . ''"
"waving her hand dismissively , she handed a pink gift bag to him ."
"`` i wanted to do this . ''"
"after peeking inside , pesh smiled before he leaned down to hug kristi ."
"`` thank you ."
"i 'm sure she 'll love it . ''"
"`` you tell her we miss her around here . ''"
"`` i will . ''"
"she patted his back ."
"`` now go on home to your girls . ''"
"he nodded and then hurried out the door ."
"today had been his first day back after taking both paternity leave and some of his many amassed sick days ."
"as he slid into the seat of his jaguar , he felt a rush of embarrassment at how he had actually gotten teary on the way to work that morning after leaving megan ."
"it had been the longest shift of his entire life ."
"he thought he would never be through so he could get home to her ."
"even now , the usual ten-minute drive home seemed to take an eternity ."
"he anxiously drummed his fingers on the steering wheel ."
"he 'd tried not to pester megan with too many calls and texts , but after the tenth , `` how are you guys ? ''"
"text , she 'd told him to lighten up and get his head in the game at work ."
"that 's why he did n't even bother telling her he was on his way home ."
"as he pulled into the driveway , he noticed emma 's suv ."
"he was glad to know that megan had n't been alone without him ."
"when he pushed through the garage door into the kitchen , emma was at the stove ."
"`` hello , '' he called pleasantly ."
"whirling around , she gave him a beaming smile ."
"`` hello to you , too . ''"
"`` how are my girls ? ''"
"`` good ."
"they 've slept most of the day . ''"
"pesh nodded ."
"noticing how quiet the house was , he asked , `` where 's mason ? ''"
"`` patrick came by and got him , along with noah and caroline , a little while ago . ''"
"she cocked her head at pesh and grinned ."
"`` although he swore to me that he would n't ruin their dinner , i have a feeling they 're having ice cream right now . ''"
"pesh smiled at the mention of his son ."
"although he was n't mason 's biological father , the love he felt for him was just as strong as if he had been a part of his conception ."
"from the moment he 'd been able to adopt him , he had felt an even stronger bond than before , especially whenever he saw `` mason nadeen '' written on his pre-school paperwork ."
"more than anything , he relished being a father ."
"he had been forced to wait so long , while desiring it so hard , that it made it all the more sweeter ."
"because mason adored baseball , pesh had bought season tickets to the braves , rather than the opera ."
"even though pesh had never been athletically inclined , he signed up to help coach mason 's little league team as well ."
"every time he heard mason say `` daddy , '' it warmed his heart the same as it did to hear megan say `` i love you . ''"
"pesh eyed the dishes on the stove ."
"`` it 's awfully kind of you to come stay with megan on my first day back ."
"but we certainly did n't expect for you to cook . ''"
"`` it 's my pleasure ."
"besides , it kills two birds with one stone-i can feed my family and yours ."
"aidan 's coming by after work . ''"
"`` good ."
"i 'll be glad to see him . ''"
"as his gaze swept toward the living room , emma laughed ."
"`` go on ."
"you do n't have to stay here with me ."
"i know you want to see your girls . ''"
"he smiled ."
"`` thank you ."
"i have missed them terribly today . ''"
"after giving emma a quick kiss on the cheek , he made his way into the living room ."
"at the sight of megan sleeping on the couch next to a frilly pink pack n play , his chest swelled with so much love and pride he felt like it might explode ."
"peeking over the side of the pack n play , he eyed his dark-haired daughters ."
"after waiting so long to become a father , he had been doubly blessed when they found out they were having twins ."
"while aidan liked to claim that his fear of the twin gene in his family had bypassed him , and instead , it had found its way to megan , that was n't entirely true ."
"his girls were identical twins , which had nothing to do with old wives ' tales ."
"the two of them looked so much alike that megan put different colored socks on them to tell them apart ."
"although it had freaked megan out a little at the prospect of two babies to care for along with mason , pesh was thrilled ."
"every aspect of the pregnancy and birth had been special to him ."
"thankfully , megan had been blessed with great health , although she had been advised to take early maternity leave to stay off her feet ."
"after her clinicals , she had accepted a job in the er at wellstar , where they sometimes were on similar shifts ."
"the girls arrived only a few weeks short of their due date and were both healthy five pounders ."
"six weeks later , they were thriving and were the greatest joy in his life ."
"sucking relentlessly on her pacifier , maya 's wide eyes took in her surroundings ."
"she stretched and flailed her arms ."
"if she was n't careful , she was going to hit her sister ."
"since sara remained sleeping soundly , pesh bent over and picked maya up ."
"he kissed her cheek before drawing her close to his chest ."
"as he stared into her tiny face , he could n't help the surge of love that overtook him ."
"for all the years of struggle and heartache he had endured , it was moments like these that made him feel as though he was finally complete ."
"his heart was full , and he was so thankful ."
"once they learned they were having girls , he and megan had decided to give them both indian and irish names to represent their combined heritages ."
"maya , which meant princess and honorable in indian , was coupled with katherine , to honor emma , whose middle name was katherine ."
"without emma , he and megan never would have met ."
"sara , which meant 'soul ' , was given her mother 's real name , margaret , as her middle name ."
"at the sound of megan 's gentle snores , he smiled ."
"`` did you wear your mommy out today ? ''"
"he asked maya ."
"she opened her tiny mouth like she wished she could respond to him ."
"`` let 's wake her up . ''"
"after he swept a strand of megan 's long blonde hair out of her face , pesh leaned down to kiss her cheek ."
"she stirred as her eyes fluttered opened ."
"`` hey , '' she said with a lazy smile ."
"`` hello , my love , '' he replied ."
"`` how was your first day back ? ''"
"she asked , as she stretched her arms over her head ."
"he grimaced ."
"`` absolutely miserable without you and the girls . ''"
"megan smiled ."
"`` we missed you , too . ''"
"she jerked her chin up at maya ."
"`` she cried for thirty minutes straight after you left ."
"i think we have a serious daddy 's girl on our hands . ''"
"`` really ? ''"
"he asked , gazing down at maya ."
"he could n't help the warm glow that spread through his chest at megan 's words ."
"at just six weeks old , his girls were already showing distinct and different personalities ."
"maya was inquisitive and fought sleep to be awake to see what all was going on ."
"he 'd ended up holding her more than sara simply because maya often exhausted megan by not going to sleep ."
"sara , on the other hand , was already very sweet tempered and a natural snuggler ."
"she probably represented his more laid-back , quiet personality where maya was likely to be a little firecracker , just like her mom ."
"maya stared up at him , her dark eyes peering intently at him ."
"`` did you miss me , my little princess ? ''"
"a fleeting smile appeared on her face ."
"`` oh my god , she smiled at you ! ''"
"megan cried ."
"`` but babies do n't respond with smiling until later ."
"it must be gas or something , '' he argued ."
"megan nudged his leg with her knee ."
"`` she most definitely smiled at you , pesh . ''"
"she rose off the couch to rub maya 's cheek ."
"`` you smiled at your daddy , did n't you ? ''"
"without taking her eyes off of pesh , maya flashed another smile and waved her fist ."
"the sight caused tears to sting his eyes ."
"he blinked fast , trying to clear them ."
"he did n't like feeling emotionally weak in front of megan ."
"but he knew he was busted the moment megan murmured , `` oh baby . ''"
"she slid her arm around his waist , leaning up on her tiptoes to burrow her face in his neck ."
"`` do you know how much my love for you grows because you just got teary over your daughter ? ''"
"he glanced down at her in surprise ."
"`` really ? ''"
"`` mmm , hmm . ''"
"she gave him a brief kiss ."
"`` after davis , all i ever wanted was for my children to have a father who loved and adored them . ''"
"she smiled ."
"`` you make that dream come true every day . ''"
"he brought his lips to hers ."
"his mouth worked frantically to illustrate all that he was feeling inside-the intense love that he felt would burst from him ."
"`` i love you , '' he murmured against her lips ."
"`` i love you , too . ''"
"just as he started to kiss her again , a loud commotion in the kitchen drew them apart ."
"megan rubbed his cheek tenderly before bestowing a kiss on maya 's head ."
"she then jerked her chin towards the kitchen , and he followed her ."
"patrick had just burst through the backdoor with all the kids in tow ."
"`` we 're back ! ''"
"mason called , as he bobbed around the kitchen ."
"three-year-old noah and his two-year-old sister , caroline , made a beeline for their mother ."
"they began chattering non-stop to emma while their bodies shook with unspent energy ."
"pesh watched with amusement as emma 's hand came to her hip and she pointed her stirring spoon at patrick ."
"`` you gave them ice cream , did n't you ? ''"
"patrick shrugged ."
"`` i 'm a grandfather ."
"spoiling them is what i 'm supposed to do . ''"
"emma rolled her eyes ."
"`` yeah , and then you bring them home to detox on my watch . ''"
"`` mommy , i hungwy ! ''"
"caroline protested , stomping her foot ."
"with her auburn hair swept back in pigtails and her emerald eyes narrowing in determination , she looked just like her mother ."
"well , her expression was pure aidan ."
"`` caroline fitzgerald , you get one ice cream cone in you , and you start acting like you have no manners ."
"we do not stomp our feet to get what we want . ''"
"she appeared thoughtful for a moment before saying , `` pwease mommy , i vewy hungwy . ''"
"emma grinned ."
"`` go wash up and then have a seat at the table in the dining room . ''"
"`` come on guys , '' mason said ."
"at almost four-and-a-half , he was always the caretaker of his younger cousins ."
"noah and caroline followed him into the half bathroom off the kitchen ."
"cradling maya in his arms , pesh joined emma at the stove ."
"`` something sure smells good . ''"
"`` thank you ."
"it 's megan 's favorite chicken casserole ."
"then there 's broccoli and cheese casserole , green beans , and some cornbread , extra crispy on the edges just like megan loves it . ''"
"the corners of her mouth turned down in a frown ."
"`` i 'm sorry it 's not indian food . ''"
"he grinned ."
"`` i would have been very surprised if it had been considering how much you did n't appreciate it many years ago . ''"
"patrick nodded in agreement ."
"`` that 's quite a spread you 've fixed for us . ''"
"emma smiled ."
"`` i was happy to do it . ''"
"`` are you feeling all right ? ''"
"pesh asked , motioning to her expanding belly ."
"emma patted her bump lovingly before responding ."
"`` i think i 've felt the best this pregnancy out of all the others ."
"you would think with a three and two-year-old , i would be exhausted all the time , but it 's amazing how good i 've felt . ''"
"patrick gave a beaming smile ."
"`` i ca n't tell you how thrilled i am to be having yet another grandson to carry on the family name . ''"
"with a wink , he added , `` not to mention the fact he 's been given fine irish names . ''"
"aidan and emma had found out the sex of their third , and final child , the week before ."
"they had decided on the name connor liam , which was a double representation of irish names ."
"while emma 's best friend , connor , was thrilled at the namesake , he also wanted them to call the baby connor as well ."
"in the end , it would be liam fitzgerald joining the rest of the crew in four and a half months ."
"`` and is aidan still feeling okay ? ''"
"pesh asked ."
"emma opened her mouth to answer him , but aidan chose that moment to walk in the door ."
"`` me and my soon to be non-swimmers are just fine , '' he replied , with a grin ."
"a week before he had gone under the laser for a vasectomy ."
"while caroline had been a surprise , liam had not ."
"with emma nearing thirty-four , they thought it best to finish out their family while they were still young ."
"and while emma was pregnant and there were no worries about conception , aidan thought it was the best time to get his vasectomy and let it take effect ."
"`` daddy ! ''"
"caroline squealed , as she came bounding around the corner ."
"aidan 's grin grew wider as he took his daughter in his arms ."
"`` hi sweet pea . ''"
"she kissed both of his cheeks before she started wiggling , wanting down ."
"noah ran to him next , and he got to hold his son a little longer as noah told him all about his day helping out with the babies ."
"a cry from the living room snapped pesh 's attention away from aidan and emma ."
"megan was bending over the pack n play , picking up sara ."
"`` aw , what 's wrong , sweetheart ? ''"
"she cooed , as she took sara into her arms ."
"as megan rocked her back and forth , sara continued wailing , which caused maya 's face to crumple up as well ."
"`` you must be hungry . ''"
"`` i 'll get their bottles , '' pesh called , over the twin 's loud cries ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"as emma worked to gather the kids , along with patrick and aidan , around the dining room table , pesh got busy heating up the formula ."
"once he had the two bottles fixed , he grabbed them and then went to the dining room ."
"megan was already seated with mason trying to entertain sara to stop crying her crying ."
"he passed a bottle to megan before sitting down himself ."
"he 'd barely gotten the bottle in her mouth before maya started sucking greedily at the formula ."
"as aidan reached to start spooning some chicken casserole onto his plate , patrick shot him a disapproving look ."
"with a sigh , aidan dropped the serving spoon ."
"`` you gon na say grace even though it 's not your house , pop ? ''"
"`` why yes , i am ."
"it 's good for all these children to learn , '' he replied , motioning to noah and caroline who sat between their parents , and then over to mason ."
"`` it should be up to pesh and megan whether it 's said or not , '' aidan grumbled ."
"pesh held up his free hand that was n't holding maya ."
"`` it 's fine ."
"truly , i do n't mind . ''"
"aidan mouthed `` suck up '' at him before grinning ."
"pesh merely shook his head at aidan 's antics ."
"`` then let 's return thanks , '' patrick said ."
"with maya still taking long pulls at her bottle , pesh bowed his head ."
"as patrick recited the blessing , pesh could n't help feeling so very blessed himself ."
"three years ago , the dining room would have been empty ."
"most likely , he would have been grabbing something on the way home or finishing some leftover takeout ."
"but now , he had a beautiful , loving wife by his side-one he fell a little more in love with each and every day ."
"across from him , he had a son who was strong and healthy ."
"in his arms and his wife 's , he had two daughters who he could n't wait to see what the future held for them ."
"he also had the love and support of good friends and family ."
"at the end of the day , true love in its many forms was all you could really hope for and cling to ."
"chapter 1 that 's it ."
"i 'm spanking her ass as soon as we get back to the house , right before i f**k her little ass into submission ."
"i watched with the other couple hundred thousand spectators as she gyrated her ass and flaunted what belonged to me for all to see ."
"yes , i know it 's her job as the newest and hottest pop sensation on the scene today , but we talked about this shit ."
"i have no problem with her performing , but there 's such a thing as going too far ."
"she 'd come out on the stage dressed conservatively enough in the floor length dress with the split up the middle to her crotch ."
"even that was a bit risque for my taste , but i could n't expect her to change everything overnight ."
"what i did n't expect , and what was now driving me insane , is the two piece bikini number she was now wearing after dropping the dress , or more to the point , after one of the male dancers had undressed her on stage ."
"no one sitting near me could tell that i was seething with rage ."
"i kept my face at ease and my slouch in the chair in the front row of the awards show was that of a man with nothing on his mind but enjoying the show ."
"by now everyone knew we were an item , the thirty-five year old business mogul , and the twenty -three year old pop sensation ."
"we 'd been able to keep our affair hidden for all of two months and that only because of my high security ."
"but now the cat was out of the bag and everyone was in our f**king business ."
"i was n't too worried about it , i just do n't like my personal life splashed across the headlines , but i guess it came with the territory ."
"i 'd seen her for the first time three months ago ."
"it was at a lingerie show of all things ."
"not my usual milieu , but my sister had dragged me along since her husband was away on business , and she did n't want to go it alone ."
"i 'd sat there prepared to be bored out of my mind for the next two hours or so ."
"i 've seen and had my fair share of models over the years , and they no longer appealed ."
"so imagine my surprise when she came on stage ."
"i had no idea who she was , but from the crowd 's reaction she was someone of note ; before she even opened her mouth to sing the place had gone insane ."
"it was her voice that caught my attention first , sultry and hot , with an old world flavor to it ."
"when i finally looked up at the stage , my breath had got caught in my lungs ."
"she was f**king magnificent ."
"i wondered how many of the men in the audience were focused on her instead of the scantily clad models as they made their way down the runway ."
"i know i spent the next three minutes or however long the song was , totally captivated by her ."
"i pulled my phone and cancelled my dinner date and essentially ended the six-month relationship i 'd been barely having with another woman ."
"i 'm a man of action , i 've learned in the cutthroat world of high finance that there 's no other way to be ."
"when i see something that i want , i go after it ."
"consequences be damned ."
"they had her name highlighted behind her on the stage so i used my phone to google her ."
"i needed to find out what moves i had to make to acquire her ."
"if she were married , i 'd step back ."
"that 's not my style ."
"anything else , she was fair game ."
"shiane ; she was twenty-three years old and had been heating up the charts for the last two with hit after hit since her debut ."
"she 'd only been linked with one guy in the past two years ."
"some on again , off again deal with a kid who was not much older than she ."
"they were having an off period ; perfect ."
"if i had anything to say about that , it would be a permanent thing , or until i 'd had my fill at least ."
"i 'm not one for long relationships ."
"i stay as long as they run their course and leave when they 've grown stale ."
"i have yet to find a woman who could hold my interest for more than a few months at a time ."
"and i always let them know up front what the deal is ."
"though it seemed women were always saying they were fine with it until the end came ."
"like cynthia , that night when i 'd called to tell her it was over ."
"it was n't the most conventional way to do things ."
"usually , i sent over one of tiffany 's little blue boxes to ease the blow , but there was no time , so i 'd have to do it the next day ."
"she started to get upset on the phone and i had to remind her of the words i 'd spoken on our first date ."
"she was n't too happy , but it will have to suffice ."
"as much of a bastard as i am , the thought of pursuing one woman while embroiled with another , just did n't suit me ."
"after the phone call , i 'd sat there and watched the anorexic looking clothe-horses as they pranced up and down the stage ."
"there was still a buzz about the hot little starlet who 'd just left the stage , and i smiled quietly to myself when i heard some ass behind me tell his friends that he was going to make his move ."
"the program said she had one more performance near the end of the show , so i sat patiently and waited ."
"when she came out the second time , i actually sat up in my seat ."
"my back was n't the only thing that went ramrod straight ."
"though i did n't appreciate the comments from the other men around me that night , i had to admit that she was f**king hot , as one of them had claimed ."
"she was dressed pretty much like one of the models ; only she 'd covered the panty and bra set with a see-through silk robe that did n't leave much to the imagination ."
"she outshone everyone there and it helped that she actually had a body ."
"she was all smooth curves , and her legs , i could already imagine being held between them as i f**ked her ."
"whether by providence , or fate , whatever you wan na call it , our eyes met , and in that split second i saw all i needed to know ."
"i do n't think anyone else caught the faltering misstep in her routine , or heard the catch in her voice , but so in tuned was i , that i did n't miss a thing ."
"chapter 2 i waited until her number was over and the last call for the models came through the pa. then i made my excuses to my sister , who thankfully , was involved in a conversation with the woman on her other side so was n't paying too much attention , and therefore was n't in my business ."
"`` i 'll be right back sis , there 's something i need to take care of ."
"i made my way backstage the way i do most things ; like i owned the place ."
"bypassing scantily clad women and harassed assistants , i avoided their hungry gazes as i kept my gaze peeled for that waterfall of cascading curls ."
"she was off to the side surrounded by a bevy of people who were trying to hustle her through a door to the back ."
"i made my way towards them and grabbed her elbow ."
"she looked back and up and in her eyes i saw acceptance ."
"she turned to the pushy woman next to her and whispered something before following me ."
"she did n't really have a choice as i had no intentions on releasing my hold on her ."
"as soon as i found an empty room , which turned out to be some sort of storage space , i did something i do n't recall having ever done before , but had been dying to for that last hour or so ."
"crowding her back against the door to keep it closed , i held her eyes as i lowered my head to hers ."
"licking across her lips , i found the taste of strawberries suddenly intoxicating ."
"i pushed one leg between hers and pulled her body in close as i fed her my tongue ."
"`` fuck you 're sweet . ''"
"i nibbled from her lips to her ear ."
"`` you 're coming home with me . ''"
"`` i ca n't i ... '' i buried my hands in her hair , pulling her head back ."
"`` whatever it is that you 're about to say wo n't make a difference ."
"feel this . ''"
"i pressed her hand against her own racing heart ."
"`` now feel this . ''"
"lifting her i pushed my c**k into the junction of her thighs where i could feel her hot pu**y through the silk of her clothing ."
"`` do you feel that ?"
"that means that no one and nothing is going to stand in the way of me having you ."
"we do n't have to f**k tonight , but you 're sleeping in my bed . ''"
"she seemed overwhelmed by my approach and rested her head against my chest ."
"i took the opportunity to call my sister and make my excuses ."
"`` sis , i 'm sending a car for you , something came up and i have to leave . ''"
"we said our goodbyes and i called my driver who was having an evening off since i 'd driven my sister here tonight ."
"he had no problem with the last minute call since he knew he 'd be handsomely compensated for the inconvenience ."
"`` let 's get out of here . ''"
"i do n't know how we escaped the glare of flashing cameras that night , but somehow we did ."
"i 'd covered her scantily clad body with my suit jacket and held her under my arm as we made our way to the valet parking where they 'd brought my bugatti around in less then five minutes ."
"i held her hand all the way to my home in the car ."
"there were no words spoken between us in the ten minutes or so it had taken for us to get there ."
"i could feel the racing of her pulse and see the apprehension in her eyes ."
"when i helped her out of the car in the underground garage , i pressed her up against the door and swallowed her tongue again ."
"she was young and fresh and so f**king sweet she made me ache ."
"i loved the way she rubbed herself against my cock , almost as if she could n't help herself ."
"`` i 'm going to enjoy having you under me shiane . ''"
"i took her hand and led her into the building , bypassing the bank of elevators to my own personal lift in the corner ."
"she kept her head down , maybe because she did n't want to be recognized by the doorman and security , or maybe because she was shy , i was inclined to believe it was the latter ."
"once we got to my penthouse , she seemed shy and unsure of herself ."
"i 'm not one to buy into preconceived notions ."
"there 's been plenty written about me in the tabloids over the years that bears no resemblance to the truth , and though i had n't come across anything inflammatory about her in my little impromptu search , i was sure she dealt with her fair share of bullshit ."
"i also had to take into consideration her age ."
"she was young yet , for all that she was world travelled and famous , sometimes those things could hide a multitude of things ."
"like the fact that her shyness and hesitance was not contrived ."
"my first order of business was to put her at ease ."
"walking over to where she stood in front of the door as if ready to escape at a moment 's notice , i took my jacket from around her shoulders ."
"i kept my eyes on her bent head until i threw the jacket in the general direction of the chair in the corner ."
"then lifting her chin with the tip of my finger , i looked into her eyes ."
"`` you have nothing to fear here ; it 's like i said , we do n't have to f**k each other tonight ."
"i can maybe hold off until tomorrow , but i want you in my bed , in my arms ."
"what i saw tonight , i would be a fool to waste any time . ''"
"`` um , what 's your name ? ''"
"i threw my head back and laughed uproariously ."
"i 'm such a beast ."
"i had n't even introduced myself ."
"it 's a wonder she had n't run away screaming bloody murder ."
"`` i 'm trace mckenzie . ''"
"her eyes widened a bit at my name and led me to my next question ."
"`` you know my name ? ''"
"`` everybody knows who you are , do n't they ? ''"
"`` i do n't know about everyone , but maybe a good few do ."
"can i get you something to drink ?"
"what do you usually do after a performance , which was magnificent by the way . ''"
"`` i usually have warmed lemon and honey with a glass of water ."
"it helps keep my throat soothed , but i do n't expect you to have that stuff here , so it 's okay . ''"
"she bit her lip and looked down at her feet even more shy now ."
"very endearing ."
"i walked over to the in house phone and called down to have them go pick me up what she needed from the all-night market a few blocks over ."
"`` that 's taken care of ."
"it should be here in a few ."
"why do n't we go out onto the patio and relax until they get here ? ''"
"i took her elbow and led her outside where the stars were putting on a show in the night sky ."
"i was amazed at my control , everything in me wanted in her now ."
"but somehow , i knew this , whatever it was between us would n't be rushed ."
"i quirked my brow at my thoughts ."
"i 'm not one for patience and i 'd be the first to admit it ."
"she moved to sit in the chair next to mine , but i had other ideas ."
"pulling her down into my lap , i did n't give her time to protest before my lips were covering hers again ."
"i could n't seem to get enough of her taste ."
"she was wearing the same silk robe and underwear she 'd worn on stage and her body 's heat seared me ."
"by the time the bell chimed announcing the arrival of her delivery , my hands were buried in her beautiful hair and my c**k was digging into her hip ."
"i sat her in the seat a little dazed and went to answer the door ."
"in the kitchen i prepared the concoction for her and had a weird sense that i was going to be doing that a lot in the future ."
"that 's something else i never pay too much attention to , the future ."
"i usually let the chips fall where they may ."
"`` here love , i hope it 's the way you like it . ''"
"she took the tumbler from me and sipped ."
"`` umm , perfect thanks trace . ''"
"i hunkered down in front of her and she stopped with the glass halfway to her lips ."
"i held her eyes as i tried to form the words in my head ."
"`` do you have any upcoming engagements planned ? ''"
"`` i have three weeks until my next show , i do n't go on tour for another couple of months and i just wrapped up in the studio a few days ago . ''"
"`` then the next three weeks are mine ."
"let 's go to bed tomorrow is going to be a long day . ''"
"i took the empty glass from her and led her inside ."
"she was back to being nervous which was totally understandable ."
"`` the bedroom 's through there with an en suite bath if you 'd like ."
"i 'll find you something to sleep in . ''"
"she walked on in the direction i 'd pointed out while i turned for the kitchen ."
"when i made it back to the bedroom she was in the shower ."
"it took everything i had in me not to go after her ."
"the night sure was turning into one for the books ."
"i 've never brought a woman home for the sole purpose of just having here there ."
"she came out fifteen minutes later and i fought the kick in my heart ."
"she looked like a teenager with her hair brushed out around her shoulders and her face bare of makeup ."
"i walked over and unwrapped the towel she had clutched in her fist ."
"`` fuck me , it 's gon na be a long f**king night . ''"
"she was perfection ."
"her tits , which for some reason had been hidden in the robe were magnificent , i would say a dd or close , with pale pink ni**les that almost blended into the rest of her flesh ."
"her waist was tiny , i could easily span it with my hands and her hips had a nice flare to them ."
"all woman and now all mine ."
"it was topped off with a homegrown beauty that you never see these days ."
"pink flesh with a hint of a tan on her cheeks , and the cutest sprinkling of freckles across her perfectly upturned nose ."
"`` i see you 're a real blonde . ''"
"her whole body lit up with her blush at my mention of the strip of hair over her pu**y mound ."
"i kissed the top of her head as i passed her the tee shirt i 'd chosen for her to sleep in ."
"another first , i usually avoided too much familiarity with the women i dealt with ."
"having her sleep in my favorite old college shirt was very telling in deed , but we 'll see how this plays out ."
"`` i 'll be right out sweetie , you can watch tv until i 'm done or if you 're tired go to sleep . ''"
"i left her standing there and went to my own shower before i went back on my word and threw her to the ground and f**ked her the way i imagined ."
"i barely avoided rubbing one out in the shower ; just let the water beat down on me as cold as i could stand it , cooling me down a little ."
"when my felt the slight ping in my heart i held my hands out to wall and hung my head as the water cascaded down on me ."
"i knew what was happening to me , knew it down to my bones , should i fight it or let it take its natural course ?"
"i 'd never felt threatened before , in all my years of playing the filed , there was never a time when my bachelorhood was in danger ."
"it was too early yet , or at least that was the crutch i held onto as i turned the water off and stepped out of the marble shower stall ."
"wrapping a towel around my hips and grabbing another i walked into the bedroom to find her asleep ."
"my new baby was tired ."
"i stood over her , taking in the softness of her beauty in sleep ."
"i wonder how many people had ever seen this side of her ."
"i had a brief stab of jealousy at the thought of the boy she 'd been linked with ."
"i ran my fingers gently through her hair , going softly so i did n't awaken her ."
"i shook my head at myself after i leaned over and kissed her hair ."
"`` so f**king beautiful . ''"
"i whispered the words in her ear before heading to the closet for some boxer shorts ."
"no sleeping in the buff tonight , i 'd changed the game plan somewhere between seeing her on that stage and handing her that tee shirt ."
"i was treading unchartered waters here , so we 'll play it by ear , but there 's always been one constant with me throughout my lifetime ."
"i always play to win ."
"i could n't help drawing her into my arms when i finally crawled into bed ."
"she just cuddled into my chest and settled , just like this kitten i once had as a child ."
"what the f**k ?"
"i have n't thought of my f**ked up childhood or anything to do with it in a long time ."
"i looked down at the head on my chest and felt fear for the first time in my life , or at least for the first time in forever ."
"what was i to do with this new thing that was growing inside of me ?"
"i have no notion of how to deal with love and all its trappings ."
"i 'm man enough to own my feelings , but logical enough , grounded enough not to believe in love at first sight ."
"but this whatever it was that had hit me from out of left field , was a close second ."
"i fell asleep with the thought of what tomorrow might bring for us ."
"first time in thirteen years , that i did n't close my eyes with a spreadsheet running through my head ."
"chapter 3 in the morning my eyes popped open to land on hers as she looked up at me from her place on my chest ."
"`` morning beautiful girl . ''"
"i drew her in for a cuddle and to sniff the morning scent of her skin ."
"she felt right in my arms , in my bed ."
"when i pulled back she was looking at me askance ."
"`` this is so weird , i hope you do n't think i 'm in the habit of going home with strange men ... '' `` whatever you did or did not do before we met last night is in the past ."
"besides , i do n't remember giving you much of a choice . ''"
"`` i 'm gon na kiss you now sweet shiane , do n't worry about my hard cock , it ca n't seem to help doing that around you . ''"
"i turned her onto her back and covered her body with mine ."
"starting at her ear i kissed my way down her jawline to the corner of her mouth before taking soft nibbles of her lips ."
"i did n't force my way in this time , but made her want my tongue so much that she was the one who came in search of it ."
"she was the one who took my face in her hands and forced my lips open with her tongue ."
"i told myself to go easy even as i pressed my aching c**k into her heat ."
"her shirt had ridden up so that all that stood between us were a few scraps of silk ."
"my control lasted for all of ten seconds before i was eating at her lips , my hands roaming all over her body ."
"`` fuck , f**k , f**k ... shiane . ''"
"i buried my face in her neck and prayed for the strength to leave it there , not to push her panties aside and slip into her heat that i knew was going to own my ass ."
"when she nuzzled my head and squeezed me between her legs , i knew the jig was up ."
"`` baby we got ta get up ; i 'm trying to keep my word here but you 're not making it easy . ''"
"i sucked the skin of her neck between my teeth and rocked my c**k back and forth into her , my c**k ring hitting her clit with each stroke and driving me insane ."
"she hissed and shook beneath me ."
"`` fuck baby do n't do that . ''"
"i gritted my teeth and rolled away with my arm thrown over my eyes ."
"`` fuck !"
"get off the bed baby ... please . ''"
"she hesitated for a minute before i felt her leave the bed ."
"this was not f**king happening to me ."
"how the f**k was this happening to me ?"
"when i felt my breathing calm enough and my dick was down to a slow throb instead of a raging pulse , i lifted my hand and looked at her ."
"she looked so f**king young and innocent standing there , unsure of the crazy man who 'd dragged her off to his lair in the middle of the night and was now acting like an ass ."
"`` i 'm sorry baby if you 'd stayed here one second more i would 've f**ked you ."
"since i kinda gave my word i do n't want to go back on it ."
"that 's no way to start thins off ."
"it 's saturday morning , you said you do n't really have anything pressing on the calendar so i 'll tell you what we 're gon na do . ''"
"`` i 'm pretty sure if we went anywhere in this city you 'd be recognized in five minutes flat am i right ? ''"
"`` yeah pretty much . ''"
"`` and you did n't bring any clothes with you obviously , so going out to breakfast was pretty much out anyway , for now at least ."
"so ... i 'm gon na go downstairs and make us some breakfast sounds good ? ''"
"`` yeah , okay . ''"
"i studied her as she stood there with her hair all mussed from my fingers , my mark forming on her neck and the shirt hanging off her shoulder ."
"it was the sexiest f**king thing i 'd ever seen ."
"`` i changed my mind come 'ere . ''"
"she made a running leap for the bed and landed on top of me , causing my eyes to open in surprise ."
"the smile that broke out across my face was another shared first as i pulled her head down and clasping her there , took her lips in another wild kiss ."
"she kissed like an innocent and i found it thrilling to teach her my showing her how to chase my tongue with hers ."
"my c**k was leaking profusely at this point as i enjoyed running my tongue around the inside of her mouth , over her teeth , and lips before diving back in ."
"it was a long time since i 'd dry humped anyone , but f**k if that is n't what i found myself doing ."
"with one hand clasped behind her head and the other holding her ass in place , i moved her body over mine , while my c**k started leaking even more into my shorts ."
"i wanted to turn her over onto her back and just take her , but i did n't ."
"instead i pressed her cunt harder into my aching c**k and ground our pelvises together ."
"she moaned into my mouth and quivered as i felt the first burst of cum leave my spewing cock ."
"we laid still until our breathing went back to normal ."
"`` i think a shower is in order do n't you ? ''"
"i sat up with her still in my lap and rolled out of bed , headed for the shower ."
"shiane i ca n't believe i 'm doing this ."
"nothing like this has ever happened to me before , but when i 'd looked into his eyes last night while on stage , there was something there that called to me , what that was i still was n't sure , but somehow i knew i would be a fool to let it pass ."
"i would 've gone on as usual if he had n't approached me , i 'm not bold enough to have sought him out ."
"but now that i was here i was n't sure of my moves ."
"i 've only ever been with one guy , someone i met when i first started my music career ."
"i 'd saved myself all through high school , holding out for that special someone ."
"and then after i 'd been discovered , i 'd been too busy in the studio and with other engagements to think about a relationship ."
"i 've never been into the casual scene , so when i met donnie , i 'd thought i 'd found my soul mate ."
"someone i could spend my life with ."
"that was before i 'd overheard him making plans to hook up with someone else ."
"that day was the lowest point of my life ."
"when i 'd confronted him after coming out of the bathroom unexpectedly and overheard him , he 'd grown angry ."
"angry enough to hit me for questioning him ; then he 'd filled me in on the truth ."
"he 'd only been with me because it was good for his career ."
"he thought that being linked to the hottest new number on the music scene would open doors for him , which it did ."
"he called me a stupid little farm girl with rose-colored glasses ."
"as he put it , everyone was doing it ; it was known part of the business ."
"people f**ked one another to get ahead ."
"when i 'd stupidly told him i thought we would get married like we 'd talked about he 'd laughed in my face ."
"it was then that my love had started to die ."
"it did n't die completely until news of our split got out and i learned that this was n't the first time he 'd cheated , and that everyone thought i knew ."
"apparently they thought i was doing the same ."
"i was never so humiliated in my life , all our friends , if you can call them that ; had known ."
"i 'd slipped out of the spotlight for a while until my management told me i had to appear with the snake for publicity sake because of prior agreements and the album we 'd collaborated on together ."
"so for a few months the world thought we were an item again ."
"it was hard , especially when he cornered me one day after rehearsal and said we could just pick up where we left off , i was an okay f**k after all ."
"i did n't even know this person ."
"all i could do was walk away in disgust ."
"since then he 'd called me a few times , he knew i was n't seeing anyone and since he 'd been my first somehow this little farm girl should just overlook his infidelity and turn a blind eye , because according to him i was never going to find better , because everybody in the business cheats ."
"now here i am , not even a month later doing something i never thought in a million years i would ever do ."
"when i opened my eyes this morning and saw him there , his face relaxed in sleep , so perfectly handsome ."
"the first thing that caught my attention was the tattoos on his chest and arms ."
"the business suit sure had n't prepared me for that , or for what i was sure was a piercing in his cock ."
"of course i knew who he was , everyone did , the self-made billionaire who 'd come from nothing ."
"his story was told far and wide in all circles ."
"a male cinderella story if you will ."
"from what i remember his parents had been poor , from some place in the midwest ."
"he 'd boxed in high school and gained a scholarship to an ivy league university where he 'd continued his boxing career but had focused more on his studies ."
"then he 'd invented some game software and used the money from that to start his own securities firm ."
"they called him the wonder kid of wall street ."
"though kid was n't exactly accurate ."
"he put me down in the bathroom long enough to start the shower before he turned back to me and lifted the worn tee shirt over my head ."
"i was embarrassed as he pulled my panties down my thighs and when i stepped out of them and he picked them up and brought them up to his face , i thought my body would go up in flames ."
"his eyes held mine as he lowered them and then he was pulling me back into that hard chest of his again and our mouths mated ."
"he dropped his shorts while our tongues were playing tag and turned me towards the huge marble stall ."
"no words were spoken as he soaped up his hands and washed by body ."
"his hands glided over me , slowly , taking his time as he touched my body , as though he were paying homage ."
"`` i love your body baby , so f**king much . ''"
"he seemed hypnotized with by my chest , which until the look in his eyes , had always been a source of embarrassment for me ."
"they were just too ... everything ."
"but that way he touched them made me feel beautiful ."
"`` get up here . ''"
"he picked me up so that my legs went around his waist and his mouth covered mine once more as my now slippery body slid all over his chest ."
"i feel the hardness of his c**k pressing into my ass up to the small of my back ."
"i had a moment 's pause at the length of him ."
"there was no way that thing would ever fit inside me ."
"`` we have to stop baby . ''"
"he took a few more nibbles of my lips before letting me slip down his body ."
"we finished our shower after he 'd passed me the soap to return the favor ."
"my heart all but flew out of my chest as i ran my hands over his beautiful chest ."
"my face heated up as i leaned over and kissed his chest and i felt a sense of power when his body shook ."
"he turned off the water and led me out of the shower ."
"grabbing a towel he dried me before going to a door in the bathroom that led to a closet of sorts ."
"he came back with a long silk robe that obviously belonged to him , and one for himself ."
"downstairs in the kitchen he kissed me once more before seating me on a stool at the island and turning to the fridge ."
"`` an omelet okay princess ? ''"
"`` yes , sounds great . ''"
"princess , how did he know that i 've always wanted someone to call me that ?"
"he could n't have , so that was just another sign that there was something going on here that went beyond the obvious ."
"he plated the omelets and sat down across from me after pouring us both cups of coffee from his state of the art coffee maker ."
"i studied the kitchen for something to so instead of staring at his chest that was exposed by the gap in his robe ."
"i could stare at it all , or his beautiful face with those cerulean blue eyes that seemed to darken whenever he looked at me ."
"`` today is saturday , monday morning we 're going to my private doctor to have tests done ."
"not that i think you 're unsafe , this is for both of us ."
"when i take you there will be nothing between us and i want you to be comfortable with the fact that i 'm clean as well . ''"
"`` i see from the gossip rags that you 've only had one serious relationship since you came onto the music scene , tell me about that . ''"
"i laid my fork down and folded my arms around my middle ."
"`` what do you want to know ? ''"
"`` everything . ''"
"it almost sounded like a growl ."
"i kept my head down ; surely this was a bit personal for two people who 'd only just met ; more personal than cumming all over him and he you you ninny ?"
"i blushed at the memory and felt my body shudder ."
"i almost jumped out of my skin when his finger lifted my chin ."
"`` now 's not the time to think about what i can and will do to you sweetie , we need to clear some things up first ; eat your breakfast . ''"
"i told him about meeting donnie , about my childhood in the southwest and the life i 'd left behind to follow my dream of becoming a singer , the years of hard work before the payoff ."
"the supportive family who was still very much a part of my life and whom i stayed in contact with by weekly phone calls and skype chats ."
"of course i left out the most embarrassing details of my messy break-up with donnie ."
"no one outside our circle knew the real reason behind the break , but i knew it was only a matter of time before that was no longer a secret ."
"but somehow i could n't find it in me to tell this virile man who looked at me like i was the hottest sex object on the planet , that i had been such an abject failure ; or that i had been such a gullible , green fool ."
"`` did you love him ? ''"
"i looked up at him then , there was something in his voice , something i could n't quite place but it sounded menacing somehow ."
"i swallowed hard before i answered him ."
"`` i thought i did , but now i 'm not sure what i was feeling ."
"maybe i was caught up in the excitement of my new life and he was the first interesting guy to ever pay me any attention , or the first one that i noticed anyway . ''"
"`` do you two still stay in touch ? ''"
"`` no , only if we 're working on one of our songs or something that calls for us to work together in a professional capacity . ''"
"`` and how often does that happen ? ''"
"`` we just did an album together ."
"it was finished just before we broke up ."
"we might have to perform the songs together at awards shows and things like that in the future , i 'm not sure of anything right now though . ''"
"`` that 's something we 'll have to deal with , something you should know before we go any farther ."
"i 'm a very territorial about my possessions ."
"i do n't share shiane , not ever . ''"
"`` i find myself in new territory here though , because i 've never cared about a woman 's past before , never cared how many partners she had before me ."
"with you i find that i hate this boy for having had you ."
"it 's silly i know , since you know of me , then you know that i 've not been a monk myself ."
"i do n't know why i should feel this way , it just is . ''"
"i did n't say anything to that , what was there to say ?"
"like he said i 'd read of his exploits along with the rest of america ."
"he was a known lady 's man ."
"not necessarily a skirt chaser , it seems they were usually the ones doing the chasing ."
"none of his encounters if i remember correctly had ever lasted more than a few months at the most ."
"is that what he was after now ?"
"because if it was , as much as i felt that strong pull for him , i do n't think i was ready for a fling ."
"something of my inner thoughts must 've shown on my face because he brought my attention back to him with his next words ."
"`` stop worrying , like i told you , whatever was in the past is just that , the past . ''"
"could i ask him outright what his intentions were , or would he find the question gauche and immature ?"
"that as something else donnie had accused me of ."
"he 'd said that my ideals were old and outdated ."
"apparently it was against the new social norm to actually want to have a meaningful relationship that lasted longer than the time it took to scratch an itch ."
"`` you said there were some things that we needed to clear up before we went any farther , well i think you should know i 'm not into casual flings , i ... '' `` i think i got that princess . ''"
"he did n't say anything else for the longest while , just studied me over his coffee mug ."
"`` i do n't know where this is going , not exactly , but i do know there is n't going to be anything casual about it ."
"chapter 4 trace i did n't take her home until later that evening ."
"i 'd turned her phone off at about noon after it had rung for the tenth time in half an hour ."
"i had her send off a quick text to her assistant so that they knew she was alive and that was it ."
"she seemed a bit panicked at first and i knew the feeling , since i 'd once been synced with my phone and any form of communication , until i 'd learned to compartmentalize ."
"we spent the time getting to know each other , when i was n't kissing her ."
"i did n't risk getting too hot and heavy with her again , because i did n't trust myself to stop ."
"when i take her i want to feel her pu**y around my cock ."
"i have never in my life f**ked a woman without some kind of protection and definitely not without a condom ."
"i did n't look too deeply at my reasons for wanting to do it with her ."
"all i know is that the memory of her on that stage the night before , the jolt that had gone through me when our eyes connected , was something that i was n't willing to brush aside ."
"i 've spent my life following my gut and hunches that others had scoffed at , only to come out on top ."
"this just might be the biggest f**king hunch i ever play in my life ."
"if the beautiful girl that was sitting on my lap in my living room , dressed only in one of my robes , knew the thoughts that were going through my head i 'm not sure she would n't have been looking for the nearest exit ."
"everything about her called to something in me , something i had n't known was there ."
"by the time i took her home to her apartment on the other side of the park i was second guessing myself ."
"outside her apartment i looked for a parking spot ."
"`` you do n't have to walk me up you know , i 'm perfectly safe here . ''"
"`` no deal princess , i 'm contemplating turning around and taking you back home , the only reason i 'm not is because you do n't have anything to wear and i 'm sure you have stuff to take care of ."
"but i 'm coming up with you ."
"i 'm not ready for our first date to be over just yet ."
"she blushed and smiled and reached over to kiss me but then seemed to think better of it ."
"so i was the one who held her head and pulled her the rest of the way ."
"if there were any cameras around i did n't care in that moment ."
"though i understood her concerns , she 'd explained about how precious her privacy had become since she 'd found stardom , how the simplest thing like running out for a carton of milk had now become a monumental task ."
"that was something else i was going to have to take care of ."
"i was n't sure from what she 'd said , what kind of security detail she had on a daily basis ."
"i mean look how easy it had been for me to get to her and literally take her out of their hands ."
"on top of her own star status , being linked with me might put her even more in the spotlight , so i was gon na have to take care of that first thing ."
"i helped her out of the car and through the doors ."
"she was wearing a pair of my jeans rolled at the ankles and around the waist , but of course she 'd made it look like a fashion statement ."
"we made it up to her apartment with no interruptions and i was still holding her hand ."
"i loved the look of her place , it was open space and airy with windows all around with a view of the park and a bit of the city skyline ."
"it was nothing like mine , but it was n't shabby either ."
"i saw little touches of her here , in the bright colors and soft throw pillows that she seemed to have a fondness for ."
"she was back to being shy again but at lease it seemed to stem more from what i thought of her place this time ."
"we 'd spent the day practically locked together in every way but one , so most of her reticence had melted away somewhat ."
"`` i like it ."
"grab some stuff you 're coming back with me . ''"
"`` you ... i thought you said you were brining me home to take care of stuff and you 'll see me on monday ? ''"
"i looked down at her as she turned that little innocent face up to me ."
"`` i did say that baby , but i changed my mind ."
"i 'm not ready for us to be apart . ''"
"i had the fleeting thought that i may never be ready for that again , but squashed it ."
"`` do you need help packing ? ''"
"i thought i saw a bit of a smile touch the corners of her lips before she shook her head no ."
"`` can i at least check my messages first ? ''"
"`` sure . ''"
"she walked over to the machine and hit play as she dropped into a chair ."
"i walked over to the bank of windows with my hands stuffed in my pockets ."
"the first few messages were just business as usual , but then coming onto the end there was some guy , maybe her manager who seemed very irate that he could n't get ahold of her ."
"`` i thought you said you did n't have anything plan for the next little while ? ''"
"`` i do n't that 's just carl 's way , he likes to know where i am at all times . ''"
"`` hmm . ''"
"it sounded like a bit more than that to me , but i let it got for now ."
"i 'm a grown man , so that means when she 's with me this carl person could go f**k himself , because i did n't need anyone keeping tabs on me ."
"there was nothing else worrying on there and she headed into her bedroom to pack after offering me a drink , which i turned down ."
"i just wanted out of there and back home as soon as possible ."
"somehow i felt easier with her in my bed , behind my walls ."
"she came back out with an overnight bag and dressed in a pair of her own jeans and a pullover ."
"i took the bag and with her hand in mine headed for the door ."
"monday morning i had to go in early to the office , so i eased her out of my arms and went to the shower ."
"she was still out by the time i was dressed and ready to go so i leaned over the bed and kissed her awake ."
"`` hmmm . ''"
"she sighed into my mouth as she awakened with my tongue in hers ."
"i ended up sitting on the side of the bed and pulling her into my lap for a longer kiss ."
"truth is i hated the thought of leaving her ."
"the last two days had been like none i 'd ever shared and we had n't even left the house except to go to her place ."
"we 'd spent all day sunday lazing around in bed reading the paper , talking or making out ."
"i 'd already called my doctor and made the appointments adding pressure for him to rush the results which he assured me can be done ."
"`` i 'll see you in a couple hours princess , the car will come and get you around ten thirty , okay ? ''"
"i kissed her nose when she nodded against my chest and got up to leave ."
"i did n't look back at her there in my bed in my old ratty tee shirt , i was sure i would n't want to leave her if i did ."
"when it was time to send the car for her i changed my plans and instead of meeting her there i went after her myself ."
"she was putting on her shoes when i came through the door and when she saw me standing there , f**k me if her whole face did n't light up and she made a running leap and jumped into the arms i had opened for her ."
"`` hey beautiful , you missed me ? ''"
"she sniffed my neck and nodded before i pulled her head around for my lips to find hers ."
"`` we 'd better go , john promised me that if we did this early he could possibly get us the results by end of day today and i 'm afraid if we do n't i 'm gon na f**king explode . ''"
"i pulled her down just enough for her to feel the evidence of my need ."
"i had no doubts that she was clean and i was sure that i was , but somehow i wanted this , wanted us to start things off on the right foot ."
"i ignored the little voice in my head that told me there was an ulterior motive behind my actions ."
"there was no way i was thinking along those lines , no way in hell ."
"shiane i wondered if he was always this attentive , or if as with all things new , this would change once he got what he wanted ."
"will he start taking advantage of me as time went on ?"
"he was like no other man i 'd ever known , except for maybe one ."
"i 'd seen my dad treat my mom like a precious gem my whole life ."
"it 's where i 'd got my dream of a prince charming ."
"not from any storybook , but from the way i 'd seen my dad look at mom when he thought no one else was looking ."
"or the way she was always looking to him when things went south ."
"they 'd taught me to want that bond , to hold out for that and nothing less ."
"trace seemed to have that in him , but i 'd been burnt once and my heart was a little gun shy ."
"it had only been a few weeks since it was shattered after all ."
"but here i was with sweaty palms and weak knees over this guy that i barely knew ."
"the weekend had been the best one i 'd had in a long time ."
"in fact i have n't felt that relaxed since the last time i 'd taken a trip home ."
"neither of us seemed ready for the intrusion of the world just yet ."
"we wanted to enjoy getting to know each other without all the speculation and other nonsense that came with stardom ."
"downstairs there were two men in suits who looked like they 'd never smiled a day in their lives ."
"`` this is your security , i 'm sure you have some already for business purposes , but these two are from me ."
"they 'll shadow everywhere when i 'm not with you ."
"my eyes widened at that ."
"`` is that really necessary ?"
"i 'm not that big of a star yet i do n't think . ''"
"i tried laughing it off as he introduced me to the two and pulled me out the doors behind him ."
"`` this has nothing to do with your status , it 's for my peace of mind . ''"
"i started to wonder if this was something he 'd done for all the women in his past and why that should make me jealous ."
"he squeezed my hand and looked down at me ."
"`` no , you 're the first . ''"
"`` how did you know what i was thinking ? ''"
"`` i told you , the weekend was about getting to know each other , i picked up a few things . ''"
"he smirked as he helped me into the back of the town car ."
"i 'd told him of my fear of needles so he held my hand and talked to me while the doctor and the nurse did their thing , before having his taken care of ."
"it did n't take that long and soon we were back in the car ."
"`` i 'm taking you to the office for a quick tour and then it 's lunch ."
"we 'll go somewhere that i 'm sure we 'd be left alone , i 'm not quite ready to share us yet . ''"
"i rested my head on his shoulder and squeezed his hand that was still holding onto mine ."
"i think he must 've planned this and warned everyone in the building not to give me the star treatment because i saw a lot of interested looks from his employees , but no one said anything more than a friendly hello ."
"it was great ."
"lunch was in a private room in one of the city 's more upscale restaurants where there were more a list stars than i 'd ever seen in one place at once except maybe an awards show ."
"i was the one star-struck ."
"`` is that ... ? ''"
"`` yes it is . ''"
"i must 've said that a hundred times before we were seated ."
"i craned my neck to see into the other room and he laughed at me ."
"`` you 're so cute ."
"they 're looking at you and you 're in awe of them . ''"
"`` i 'm pretty sure they 're all wondering who i am , it 's you they 're looking at . ''"
"i was n't sure i was too far off the mark , most of them were starlets and they might 've given me the once over , but their attention was definitely on him ."
"i could n't blame them ."
"what he did for a suit should be illegal ."
"and to think that what was underneath was even more mouth wateringly spectacular ."
"chapter 5 trace i sent her home in the car and went back to work , my mind on the results and how soon i can have them in my hands ."
"i almost called john when the hours had drifted by and still no phone call ."
"by the end of day when it was almost time to call it quits , the messenger showed up with the envelopes ."
"i had no compunction about tearing into hers and reading the results ."
"as soon as i got the all clear my body reacted ."
"`` thank f**k ! ''"
"i left my office almost at a run ."
"my assistant called out to me as i was heading for the elevators ."
"`` is it a matter of life or death susan ? ''"
"`` uh no sir . ''"
"`` then it 'll keep until tomorrow . ''"
"i stepped in and pressed the down button ."
"i would 've called her and let her know i was on the way but even that was too much right now ."
"if i heard that sultry voice of hers on the phone i might embarrass myself again ."
"i was on a hair trigger , the slightest thing would set me off , and the next time i cum , i want to be inside her ."
"she came running when i cleared the door ."
"`` hey you 're home i made din ... '' i threw the envelopes on the little side table near the entry and grabbed her up in my arms ."
"`` later . ''"
"my mouth came down on hers as i walked us blindly towards the bedroom ."
"i did n't even stop kissing her long enough to take off the little summery top and shorts she wore ."
"`` undress me . ''"
"her hands shook a little as she went after my tie and then the buttons of my shirt while i dropped my jacket on the floor and kicked off my shoes ."
"she seemed fascinated with the ink on my torso , and could n't help running her tongue over it , so i took care of my belt and the zipper on my pants before she stopped me ."
"`` no , i wan na do it . ''"
"i released it and left her to it ."
"she 'd learned my body in the last tow days , as much as i would let her ."
"i 'd refused to let her take my c**k in her mouth so she 'd spent what felt like hours measuring me in her hands and teasing the shit out of me while i sucked her ni**les and finger f**ked her ."
"now she got to her knees and removed my socks ."
"i watched her through half slitted eyes as she looked up at me with a mischievous twinkle in her eye , right before her tongue came out and licked the pr**cum from my cockhead ."
"my body jerked and my hands fell to her hair , holding her in place as she licked and nibbled her way down my shaft , biting into my c**k ring , before taking half of me into her mouth ."
"`` fuck ! ''"
"i threw my head back as she massaged my c**k with her throat muscles and she had great control from all the voice exercises she 'd done over the years ."
"i was almost ready to pop when she took my balls in her hand and caressed them with the lightest touch ."
"`` that 's enough , i do n't want to cum in your mouth , not this first time . ''"
"picking her up , i headed for the bed and laid her back with her legs splayed open ."
"i had n't allowed myself the pleasure of studying her pu**y ; i was waiting for this moment ."
"kneeling on the floor i ran my nose over her wet heat before pulling back and opening her up with my fingers ."
"she was pink and soft and wet ."
"i teased her with the tip of my tongue , before licking deep into her pu**y ."
"her back bowed off the bed and she looked down at me in wonder ."
"i got the idea from her reaction that this was a first for her ."
"holding her ass in my hands i lifted her to my mouth and tongue f**ked her while she mewled and writhed , her fingers digging into my scalp ."
"her taste was unlike anything i 'd ever savored before , salty sweet and fresh ."
"she came on my tongue and filled my mouth with her sweet nectar ."
"i had visions of eating her sweet pu**y for hours , just burying my face in her cunt until they carted me away ."
"my c**k was n't on board for that one though ."
"i had to release one of her ass cheeks so i could squeeze him to get some relief ."
"`` sorry baby , this is gon na be hard and rough , i ca n't wait any longer ."
"climbing up her body i pulled her up higher on the bed and holding both her hands above her head , our eyes locked , i led my dick into her wet opening ."
"she was tight as f**k and my c**k almost buckled ."
"she flinched a little when i pushed the fat head of my c**k past her pu**y lips ."
"`` fuck babe , you 're so f**king tight . ''"
"i had to raise her legs so i could sink more of my c**k home and even then i was only able to get eight of the twelve inches inside ."
"she hissed and clenched around me , her eyes widening in surprise as i tried to force more of my meat into her tight as f**k pu**y ."
"`` i 'll try to go slow . ''"
"lifting her ass i opened her pu**y more , screwing myself into her little by little until i was all in ."
"it felt like hours instead of mere minutes when i was finally buried to the hilt inside her ."
"as soon as my balls hit the crack of her ass i took her mouth ."
"she fought to release her arms but i held firm ."
"bending my head i sucked first one then the other nipple into my mouth , biting her in my lust crazed haze ."
"she f**king flooded my c**k and screamed ."
"i f**ked in and out of her like a beast , her pu**y 's tight grip driving me insane ."
"her legs came up and around my waist , drawing me in deeper with every thrust ."
"i finally released her arms so i could touch her body and she clutched at me , her nails digging into my back ."
"i could n't seem to get deep enough in her , i wanted to imprint myself in her deeply , the thought moving me to lift her legs over my shoulders and bore into her ."
"`` this is mine , no one else 's ever again ; only mine . ''"
"i pushed my tongue into her mouth , not giving her a chance to answer ."
"it would n't have mattered anyway ; it was a done f**king deal ."
"i felt the familiar tingle up my spine but fought off my orgasm ."
"i did n't want to leave her body so soon , wanted to stay enclosed in her wet heat for eternity ."
"when the bed started knocking into the wall behind us , and her grunts became long drawn out moans , i knew she was close again ."
"`` cum for me baby . ''"
"i latched onto her neck with my teeth and sucked hard , leaving my mark there before moving to the flesh right above her left nipple and doing the same ."
"my sweet girl squeezed my c**k between her pu**y walls and i felt the heat of her pu**y juice as she bathed my c**k once more ."
"`` yesssssss ... '' her long drawn out hiss only made the fever burn hotter ."
"i wanted to f**k her from behind , but did n't want to leave her body long enough to change positions ."
"instead i teased her little rosebud with my fingertip and felt the answering tightening around my cock ; she liked that ."
"i used the lubrication of her juices to coat my fingers and pushed one , then two into her ass up to the first knuckle ."
"she almost bit off my tongue that i 'd just shoved back in her mouth ."
"the combination was too much for me and i roared into her mouth as i emptied my seed deep inside her ."
"i was n't done there though , i ground my pelvis into hers , flexing my still shooting c**k inside her ."
"her response had me pulling my mouth away from hers to look down into her eyes ."
"her eyes were glazed over and half closed , her mouth open in a silent scream ; but it had been the electrifying shaking of her body beneath me that had caught my attention ."
"she was sight of wantonness as i took her in , and i was n't surprised to feel my c**k hardening once more inside her ."
"`` can you take me again ? ''"
"i asked the question but i knew there was no way i was stopping now ."
"i had three days build up to work off ."
"the sheets were already drenched beneath us as i bent my knees and pulled her up into my chest so we could reverse positions ."
"i kept my knees bent behind her back as she sat up in the cradle of my lap , mu c**k going deeper up into her ."
"`` give me your nipple baby . ''"
"she leaned over like she barely had the strength to do even that and i sucked her nipple in hard as i used my hands on her hips to help her f**k herself on my cock ."
"in the mirror across from the bed , i could see where we were joined , see the glistening length of my c**k as it slid in and out of her ."
"her ass incited me to madness and i bit down on her nipple even as i sped up my thrusts , pounding up into her ."
"she flooded my pelvis and lower stomach with more of her pu**y juice and i lost it , biting into her flesh as she rode out the storm with me ."
"`` arggghhhh . ''"
"i pulled her down hard one last time as my c**k spat more sperm inside her ."
"she fell to the side limp , her hand cupping her pu**y as her body shook with after shocks ."
"i was breathing like i 'd just run a marathon , but i had enough strength in me to reach over and touch her ."
"her body was on fire , and the way she rolled around clutching herself led me to believe i 'd hurt her ."
"i got off the bed after kissing her shoulder and headed into the bathroom to run her a bath when i got back into the bedroom she was just laying there looking dazed ."
"`` is your pu**y sore ? ''"
"she blushed and buried her face in the pillow ."
"i grinned and picked her up and she did her kitten curl into my chest and nuzzled me ."
"i kissed her hair as i walked us into the bathroom ."
"i did n't trust myself to get into the tub with her , so instead i placed her inside and picked up the washcloth to bathe her ."
"she had n't said a word since i 'd finished f**king her so and i was beginning to think she was poleaxed ."
"`` you okay princess ? ''"
"she turned glazed eyes my way and gave me a little half smile ."
"`` what was that ? ''"
"`` what was what sweetie ? ''"
"i ran the washcloth over her tits , taking great care with her beautiful ni**les that were still semi erect , before working the cloth down her middle to her pu**y ."
"`` that just happened in there . ''"
"her face heated up again and i could n't resist stealing a quick kiss ."
"`` you were n't a virgin babe so i know you know what sex is . ''"
"she started shaking her head before i was through speaking ."
"`` that was n't se trace , that was , wow , shit , wow ... '' she blushed and hid behind her hair ."
"`` oh yeah ? ''"
"i grinned at her as i used the washcloth to rub against her clit ."
"she arched her back , pushing her cunt into my hand ."
"i could actually feel her heat beneath the cloth as i cupped her pu**y mound ."
"i dropped the cloth in the water and teased her swollen clit with my fingers while sucking her tongue into my mouth ."
"so much for giving her a break !"
"water went all over the floor as i lifted her from the tub ."
"my c**k was at full staff and leading the ay as i cradled her in my arms and took her back to the bed ."
"i walked around to the other side since that one was wet ."
"thank f**k for king sized beds ."
"again i did n't want to give up her mouth or her tits to f**k her doggie style so i took her down to the mattress with my body covering hers ."
"reaching my hand between us , i used my c**k to rub up and down her slit , hitting her clit with each upward stroke and rubbing the sensitive underside of my c**k against her wet heat until i slipped into her in my last downward stroke ."
"`` ohh ... '' her soft sigh broke the silence as i started f**king in and out of her , slowly this time ."
"i told myself that i would go slow if it killed me , that i would n't hurt her ."
"it was tough but i held on ."
"with my face buried in her neck , i rode her nice and slow as she lifted up to meet my thrusts over and over again ."
"i alternated between deep stroking into her and grinding my c**k into her belly ."
"her legs opened wider and i slipped even deeper into her ."
"it was a long time before i felt the familiar stirrings in my nuts again ."
"her mouth was red and swollen from me eating at her lips and her neck was a mess from the five or six hickeys i 'd given her ."
"looking down at her my heart jumped in my chest with all the things i imagined doing to her ."
"the last thought had me speeding up as i started pounding into her ."
"`` you 're not on birth control . ''"
"i bit her ear after reminding her of that fact but there was more yet to come ."
"`` you 're ovulating . ''"
"it 's amazing what they can find in those medical tests these days ."
"her breath caught as though she 'd just thought of it , but even more telling was the way her cunt tightened around my shaft ."
"i roared out loud as i shot a heavy load inside her , my last thought being that i 'd lost my f**king mind ."
"one look , it had taken one look at her to take me over ."
"how was that even possible ?"
"for a man like me it was n't even worth thinking on ."
"i would never have believed in a million years that something like this could ever happen to someone like me ."
"cynical , do n't give a f**k and a beast in the boardroom ; love and marriage was nowhere on my horizon ; until three nights ago when i 'd looked into her eyes across a stage ."
"i stayed buried inside her as we came down so it was a minute or two before i realized that she was out ."
"pulling out of her body , i drew her into my arms as i fell to my side beside her ."
"the cool air of the ac dried my nuts as i pulled the sheet up over us and dropped into sleep ."
"we awakened a short time later and took a shower to clean up and then had to take another after i violated her up against the shower stall ."
"i had n't planned to , but seeing her with water dripping down between her amazing tits and pebbled on her ni**les , it was pretty hard to resist ."
"i was careful as i lifted her with her back to the stall and surged up into her , dropping her down on my length ."
"it had been years since i 'd f**ked anyone that long and that often , in fact i do n't think i 'd ever gone four times before and i still was n't done ."
"it was as if each time only whetted my appetite for more ."
"and the way she responded to me , accepting and ready each time i took her ."
"`` if you want to get any rest tonight and maybe wan na walk anytime soon , you 'd better stop me . ''"
"i whispered in her ear as i nibbled my way down to her neck and back ."
"my c**k was still hard inside her and i 'd just off loaded in her for the fourth time ."
"her legs were still clasped around my hips as i kept her pinned against the shower ."
"her answer was to pull my lips over to hers and smash her tits into my chest ."
"as the water beat down on us , i took her down to the hard floor and started f**king her again ."
"`` this is f**king insane . ''"
"was it because i 'd slept with her in my arms for three whole nights and not taken her ?"
"i could n't think of a reason for this hunger that would n't be assuaged ."
"the more i had her the more i wanted , but if we kept this shit up she 'd spend the next three weeks bed ridden ."
"already i had noticed the red puffiness to her labia and heard the slight sounds of discomfort she made even as she spurred me on to f**k her ."
"i was sure i was killing her against the marble floor , the grunts and groans she made were becoming almost animalistic , but she threw her hips up at me taking my c**k like a pro as i did my best to nail her into her ground beneath us ."
"this time when i came the roar was more like a grunt as i shook and thrust into her until i was dry ."
"`` that 's it , we 're getting out of here , please try to keep your greedy hands to yourself shiane , my poor man 's body can only take so much . ''"
"she threw herself into my arms and howled with laughter and i felt my heart give a little more ."
"we finally made it out of the bathroom and both just threw on robes as we headed down to the kitchen ."
"`` did you say you made dinner ? ''"
"`` yep . ''"
"she went to the pots and pans on the stove and i lifted my brow quizzically ."
"i guess i was guilty of stereo typing after all , i had n't expected the little pop sensation to know her way around the kitchen ."
"she 'd made a dinner of grilled lamb chops of all things , with rice pilaf and creamed green peas ."
"`` i hope i did n't spoil it . ''"
"yeah right ."
"`` nope , the lamb was n't grilled yet , it 's still sitting in the marinade it 'll take five minutes to cook and the rest of the stuff can be reheated no problem ."
"you just sit and i 'll take care of everything , '' `` yes ma'am . ''"
"i opened a bottle of wine and poured her a glass , taking one for myself as i sat at the island and watched her flit around my kitchen ."
"she seemed , happy ."
"it was strange to look at this almost stranger and realize that already i 'd come to know her so well ."
"did she even realize that she 'd started signing ?"
"she had n't done that since she 'd been here ."
"i would 've thought that she spent every waking moment singing , but this was the first time since i 'd brought her home that i 'd heard her so much as hum ."
"it was n't the song from the other night , this one was slow and dreamy , with a catchy little lilt to it that made me want to strain to hear the words since she was singing so low ."
"`` sing louder princess i wan na hear you . ''"
"she turned wide eyes to me and looked down at her feet ."
"`` i 'm not really good at that . ''"
"`` come again . ''"
"`` i mean i 've learned how to control my fear somewhat before i go out on stage , but i ca n't really sing in front of anyone just like that . ''"
"`` so how do you do it ? ''"
"'my manager gives me these pills ... '' i did n't like the sounds of that one bit ."
"`` what kind of pills ? ''"
"i lowered my glass and looked at her ."
"`` it 's nothing bad , just something to calm my anxiety . ''"
"`` is there a prescription ? ''"
"`` no nothing like that , i never even asked him where he gets them ... '' `` do you have them with you now ? ''"
"`` no why ? ''"
"she looked at me quizzically . ''"
"`` i 'll just like to have a look at them that 's all , make sure they 're okay . ''"
"`` oh i 'm sure they 're fine doug would never do anything to hurt me . ''"
"`` so you have the pills back at your place ? ''"
"`` no , doug keeps them with him , he gives me one before each performance or sometimes when i have to go on one of those talk shows ."
"looks like i was gon na have to have a talk with her manager ."
"she was so f**king green , i was sure it would never cross her mind to question anything the man did ."
"though i did n't know him personally , i 'm a businessman and i know all about the bottom line ."
"her voice is like liquid gold , i 'm sure dear old doug would do anything to see that nothing got in the way of her making them money ."
"that was something else i was gon na have to look into as well ."
"when i 'd made the decision to own her , everything that she is became my responsibility ."
"there might be some friction because i 've noticed that she has a bit of an independent streak , but i had no intentions on letting that stop me ."
"though i 'd save it for another time , nothing was going to mar the night for us ."
"`` voila , dinner is ready . ''"
"she seemed nervous as she served me , and then herself ."
"i closed my eyes with the first taste of the succulent lamb ."
"`` wow , where did you learn to cook like this ? ''"
"`` my mom taught me and i love watching the cooking channel , you really like it ? ''"
"i took another bite and it was good as the first ."
"nodding my head i leaned over and pecked her lips ."
"`` it 's amazing princess , wow . ''"
"i kept the conversation light over dinner , asking her more about life on tour and what she enjoyed most about her fame ."
"as far as i could tell she was more interested in the singing than anything else ."
"`` um , trace , you were n't serious about that ovulating thing were you ? ''"
"i 'd almost forgotten about that , still was n't quite sure what had possessed me to think of it much less say it ."
"but now that she 'd asked me outright ... `` as a matter of fact i am ."
"it 's crazy i know , and if one of my colleagues had come to me with this story i would tell him he 's crazy ."
"i have no explanation for it , the reality is that from the moment i saw you up on that stage something inside me shifted . ''"
"`` i find myself reverting back to childhood , to a time when i had to scrounge for every scrap i wanted or needed ."
"when i became successful , i promised myself that i 'd never go hungry again , and not just for food , but for any of those things i 'd longed for as a child , or anything my heart may desire as an adult . ''"
"`` you 're the first thing my heart 's ever desired ."
"i 've known wants before do n't get me wrong , but this , this is different ."
"this goes beyond my own comprehension ."
"like i told you before , this past weekend was about getting to know each other and i 've gotten to know you ."
"you would n't have come home with me had you not felt some of what i was feeling ."
"i also know that you 're more about hearth and home than the night life . ''"
"i did n't tell her that i knew that 's why she 'd stayed with the ass**le who 'd ended up cheating on her ."
"i 'd done some research after she was less than forthcoming about the reason for their split ."
"it was n't a known fact as yet but i had my ways of finding out things ."
"i wo n't tell her that i knew though ; it was her story to tell if and when she was ready ."
"i did know that if i ever ran into the little prick , i was gon na beat the crap out of him for putting his hands on her though ."
"it did n't matter that i did n't even know her when it happened , it 's just the way i am , or at least it 's the way i seem to be where she 's concerned ."
"`` but a baby ?"
"we hardly even know each other . ''"
"`` i do n't think that whatever is going on here has anything to do with time and convention ."
"either way , it 's nothing to worry about now ."
"what 's done is done , and if it is n't , i 'm gon na make damn sure that it is ."
"the only problem is your upcoming tour , but i 'm sure people have performed while pregnant before . ''"
"`` do you know how crazy this all sounds ? ''"
"i shrugged my shoulders at her ."
"i thought it was crazy too in the beginning so i could n't fault her for having her own doubts ."
"it was crazy when you looked at it , but it 's what i felt and well ... `` i 'm sure there have been people who got married after only one day of meeting or maybe two ."
"i 'm even more sure that there are people who get pregnant after just one meeting ."
"look at this way ; at least we both know where we stand ."
"if the last few hours are anything to go by , we want each other more than a little bit and the bottom line is princess ."
"i want you , in my life , with me , no matter what ."
"so baby or no baby , you 've met your future , so i suggest you get used to the idea . ''"
"`` what if i had other plans ? ''"
"`` like i said , i 've gotten to know you , and all that aside , this is what i want baby ."
"as time goes on you 'll find that i never let anything stand in my way , nothing and no one ."
"dinner was delicious why do n't you go find us something to watch while i clean up ? ''"
"chapter 6 shiane i guess the conversation was over and what a strange one at that ."
"i headed out of the kitchen on wobbly legs for the tv room to find something to watch , though i really did n't have much interest ."
"my mind was awhirl with all the new things that were going on in my life ."
"in the space of a few short days , it seems my life had been turned upside down ."
"i find myself doing things that were totally outside the box for me ."
"but this latest was a lot to take in , though the thought of it made me hot ."
"trace was right ."
"i 've always only ever wanted to be a mother and a wife ."
"i 'd thought i would have that life with donnie , but was it possible to have it with this man that i 'd only just met ?"
"what if he was just saying these things because like he 'd said , he 'd come to know me and knew that 's just what i wanted to hear ?"
"how was it possible that he could want me like that after a chance meeting ?"
"i 'd spent some time today looking for any and everything i could find about him on the net ."
"the one thing that stood out except for his success as a businessman , was the fact that he had a different woman every couple of months ."
"had he used this same line on them ?"
"somehow , he did n't strike me as the type ."
"still , i had another worry ."
"the things he 'd made me feel ."
"how will i live without them if this was all just a game to him ?"
"he 'd made me feel things i never knew were in me ."
"my body has never reacted this way before , and even though his size was a little uncomfortable , the pain was more a pleasure-pain than a real hurt ."
"i felt myself creaming just thinking about it ."
"could a man really make love to a woman that much without some kind of feeling involved ?"
"what if it was just lust ?"
"i 'd seen pictures of some of the women he 'd dated in the past and i have to say some of them were drop dead gorgeous , including the last one he 'd been seen with a couple weeks ago ."
"the though caused me a moment 's doubt and i thought if ways to shield my heart this time , but i was afraid i might be too late ."
"he 'd taken me over completely , something i had no experience with ."
"i had n't the faintest idea how to handle a man like trace mckenzie ."
"he was way out of my league ."
"i heard him coming and searched through the stack of movies he had for something to watch ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"he came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me from behind ."
"`` what makes you think something 's wrong ? ''"
"i looked over my shoulder at him trying to put a brave face on ."
"`` i was n't sure when i first came in but now i 'm certain it 's all over your face . ''"
"he pulled me towards the couch and down on his lap with his arms holding me close ."
"for some reason i wanted to cry ; he 's been so kind and attentive in the time that we 'd been together , what if it were all a farce ?"
"i had no idea that i 'd started to cry until i felt his fingers wiping my cheeks dry ."
"`` tell me what 's bothering you sweetheart . ''"
"i could only shake my head and cry harder as i buried my face in his chest ."
"`` please do n't play games with me trace , i ca n't stand it if you 're just using me for some sick game ... '' i broke off when he lifted my face to his ."
"`` baby !"
"i forgot you do n't know that much about men , only that boy you were messing around with ."
"let me show you something . ''"
"he stood up and took my hand in his , leading me out of the room and into the bedroom ."
"standing me in front of the floor-length standing mirror , he removed my robe , dropping it to the floor , as i stood before him naked ."
"`` you see those marks all over your neck and tits ?"
"do you know what those are called ? ''"
"`` hickeys ? ''"
"`` that 's one word for it , they 're also known as passion marks ."
"i 've never given one to a woman before ."
"not since i learned what they meant as a young man ."
"they may mean different things to different people ."
"to me , they are a mark of ownership . ''"
"`` that 's my mark on you ."
"i put it there as a statement to you and anyone else who might see them , the ones on your neck anyway , anyone else sees the others , i 'll heat up your little ass . ''"
"his hand dropped to one in particular spot that was right at the tip of my pu**y ."
"`` another thing , i do n't think a man that 's not really interested in a woman can f**k her five times if he did n't really mean it . ''"
"`` five ? ''"
"i started counting on my fingers and got to four before i was being carted off to the bed ."
"i looked up into his eyes as he laid me back and spread my legs before dropping his robe ."
"his c**k was hard and red , with a string of pr**cum hanging from the end heading for the floor ."
"trace i knew she had to be sore , but she also seemed to need reassuring and for now this was the best i could do ."
"only time will convince her that this was the real deal ."
"fuck i was just as confused as she was , but unlike her , i was n't about to let doubts get in the way of what i wanted ."
"taking her soreness into consideration , i dropped to my knees between her spread thighs and opened her pu**y lips gently with my fingers ."
"she was a little red and puffy from too much f**king , but she was also getting wet ."
"i licked her clit with the tip of my tongue , staying away from her pu**y slit for now ."
"`` ooh ... '' i love how f**king responsive she is , the way she lights up as soon as i put my hands on her ."
"i licked and sucked her clit until her juices started coming fast and furious ."
"then i dipped my tongue into her pu**y , going slow so i could soothe the ache in her overused cunt ."
"she gripped my hair and mashed her pu**y into my mouth before she filled my mouth with pu**y juice ."
"when she came down from her climax i helped her up from the bed and folding her in my arms kissed her long and deep , sharing her taste with her ."
"we tongue f**ked each others ' mouths like starving wolves and my c**k was poking into her navel as she rubbed herself against me ."
"`` suck me off baby . ''"
"she slid down to her knees and studied my c**k before sticking out her tongue and licking the pr**cum from my cockhead ."
"she 's an enigma , all shy and blushing one minute and my little vixen the next ."
"i had a moment of jealousy at the thought that she 'd done this with that ass**le but let it go for now ."
"i 'm a very territorial f**ker , i knew i had to live with the fact that he 'd had her but i needed to erase him from her memory ."
"she licked along my shaft before sucking the fat head of my c**k into her mouth and sliding her mouth down my length until she 'd taken me in as deeply as she could ."
"i fisted her hair and waited until i was in her throat before i started thrusting in and out of her mouth , going slow at first , until i picked up the pace ."
"pretty soon i was face f**king her and she was moaning around me cock ."
"i looked down past her eyes that were staring up at me and saw that she had her fingers stuffed in her pu**y. i almost shot my load then and there ."
"she did some kinda muscle spasm around my c**k and my toes curled ."
"i pulled back so that i was no longer in her throat but on her tongue ."
"i did n't warn her that i was about to cum , why would i ?"
"she was going to swallow unless i said otherwise , and the only time i 'll do that is when i was in the mood to paint her face , her tits or the small of her back ."
"she almost gagged on the first volley ."
"`` easy , breathe princess . ''"
"she soon got the hang of it and was swallowing fast enough in time to catch the next load ."
"when my balls were empty and my knees were almost too weak to stand i helped her to her feet and took her to the bed ."
"`` forget the movie baby , you need me to hold you . ''"
"i laid down behind her with her much tinier frame completely covered by my arms and legs , cocooning her as i whispered in her ear ."
"`` everything 's going to be okay princess , i promise ."
"if you 've learned anything about me so far , you should know i 'm not a man that plays games ."
"`` but you 've had girlfriends before ; did you feel the same way with them ? ''"
"her voice had gone all soft there at the end and i felt her body tense as if expecting a blow ."
"`` let me ask you this ; do you feel the same with me as you did with him ? ''"
"now it was my turn to tense up as i awaited her answer ."
"when it came , it went a long way of easing the green-eyed beast that had been trying its best to rear its ugly head ."
"`` no , i 've never ... but it 's not the same ."
"you 've had so much more experience and i 'm sure i do n't measure up to some of them . ''"
"`` that 's where you 're wrong sweetheart , first of all none of them ever came close and besides its about more than the physical ."
"sometimes in life you find that one being that you ca n't live without , you may have sampled a lot along the way , but when you found the one , it 's a whole new ballgame . ''"
"`` tell me , what did you feel that night when our eyes meet ? ''"
"she turned around in my arms and looked up into my eyes ."
"`` it was like being struck by lightning , or at least what i imagine that would feel like ."
"i felt a jolt to my system and i think i forgot how to breathe for a minute ."
"i almost panicked because for a split second i forgot the words to the song . ''"
"`` there you see ?"
"have you ever felt that before with anyone ? ''"
"she shook her head and bit her lip ."
"i could see the soft sheen of tears in her eyes and pulled her close to kiss her forehead ."
"`` it was pretty much the same with me baby ; so the next time you start doubting what we have , just remember those few minutes ."
"now go to sleep , you 've had a long day . ''"
"i turned her back around intending to go to sleep , but by now my c**k was raging again ."
"`` lift your leg baby . ''"
"she lifted her top leg and i scooted down far enough to line up my c**k with her pu**y. i slid in and held still pulling her back firmly against my front ."
"`` i 'm not going to f**k you again tonight , we 'll just stay like this until you fall asleep , you need your man to stay inside you to keep the doubts away . ''"
"i was suddenly very tired , and it was n't long before i fell asleep to the sound of her breathing evenly in sleep ."
"in the morning , i awakened to her pushing her ass back against me with my c**k still lodged inside her ."
"with my hand on her hip , i controlled the pace ."
"`` can you take me hard or do you need me to go slow baby ? ''"
"i nipped her ear as she flooded my cock ."
"`` harder , please harder . ''"
"`` please what harder ? ''"
"she did n't answer so i reached around and pinched her nipple ."
"`` tell me or i 'll stop . ''"
"i held still and she tried to f**k herself on my cock ."
"i pulled back as if i was going to leave her body ."
"`` noooo , please , harder ... fuck me harder . ''"
"fuck , i think that shit backfired on my ass , because her sweet voice saying those words triggered something inside me ."
"leaning up on my elbow i reached my hand around and fingered her clit ."
"`` put your arm behind my neck . ''"
"she complied with my order and i bent my head to her nipple ."
"she screamed and went off like a rocket from the dual pleasure , or was it triple ?"
"i f**ked into her hard as i played with her clit and sucked her nipple ."
"i imagined my son or daughter nursing at her bountiful tits some day soon and the next time her pu**y clenched around me , i shot off inside her ."
"it was harder than i imagined it would be to leave her the next day ."
"chapter 7 for the next three weeks , we stayed hidden away in our lover 's paradise ."
"each day , i went off to work and left her home ."
"and each night , i came home and after dinner , f**ked her into the wee hours of the morning ."
"when it was time for her to go back to work , i thought i would lose my f**king mind ."
"i did n't want to share her with anyone ."
"i knew it was selfish ; she had a life , a career that she loved ."
"`` i want you to move in here with me . ''"
"she did n't seem too certain , still fighting those doubts i guess ."
"`` scratch that , i 'll send a service over to help you pack up , but when i get home this evening your little ass better be here . ''"
"i left before she could give me an argument ."
"i was pissed off the whole day and did n't know why ."
"in the last three weeks , i could pick up the phone and call her whenever i wanted ."
"now she was busy doing her thing ."
"i did n't like it one f**king bit ."
"when had i become this person ?"
"i knew that what i felt for this girl was more than i 'd ever felt before , but still , this overpowering need to possess her completely , to dominate her life , was new to me ."
"her upcoming show was out of town and i would n't be able to make it because of the timing ."
"i was going to be without her for two weeks while she travelled outside the country for a eight night show ."
"she 'd been going to the studio to rehearse the last couple of days coming onto the end of our time together , but she 'd been there in the evenings ."
"she never said what if anything her handlers had said about the arrangement , but that could be because i 'd let her know one day when she tried to broach the subject that i really did n't give a f**k. i heard her as soon as i cleared the door that evening ."
"good , that meant i did n't have to hunt her down and drag her ass back home ."
"i 'd half expected her to disobey my order to be here when i got home ."
"there were boxes in the living room and i breathed a little easier ."
"looks like i was getting my way after all ."
"`` hey ! ''"
"she was in the kitchen when i walked up on her ."
"she had n't heard me because she had earphones on ."
"pulling them out , she looked up at me with her little shy smile ."
"i knew she was fretting again about where we were going ."
"i imagine moving in here with me was a big step for her ."
"she 'd never lived with a man before , and i had to keep reminding myself that she was young yet ."
"`` did everything go okay with the move today ? ''"
"`` yeah , i still have some stuff to bring over and some will have to go into storage . ''"
"`` did they give you any trouble with the lease ? ''"
"`` uh about that ... i 'm not sure that i wan na give up the place just yet . ''"
"i just looked at her not saying anything ."
"`` when i asked you to move in here , did you think i meant for a few weeks or something ? ''"
"`` no , i do n't know . ''"
"`` take care of the lease shiane ."
"or i will ."
"do n't forget , i 'm a businessman ."
"it makes no sense whatsoever for you to keep that place and pay the exorbitant rent for an empty apartment ."
"i understand that you still have doubts and fears , but i 'm not about to let them get in the way of things ."
"i 've spent the last three weeks trying to show you , but apparently that was n't enough so you 're just gon na have to decide if you want to take a chance at happiness or not ."
"a word to the wise : i wo n't pay for someone else 's short- comings ."
"so if that 's what this is about , you can kill that shit right f**king now . ''"
"it seemed like we were about to have our first real argument there for a minute , but then she backed down ."
"she needed me to take charge and i had no problem with that ."
"she 'd gone from under her parents ' care , straight to this manager 's handling , so basically , she 's been told what to do her whole life ."
"some people rebel against that , but with shiane , it was quite the opposite ."
"she needed it ."
"she left two days later for europe and i spent the time gathering as much information as i could on her manager and the other people around her ."
"i did n't like that pill deal she 'd told me about , and from some of the things she 'd said , i was n't too sure that her best interest was being taken care of ."
"as her man , it was up to me to see that no one was taking advantage of her ."
"and though our relationship had been spared the spotlight thus far , it was only a matter of time before word leaked out ."
"and how would it look for wall street 's whiz kid to be letting others take advantage of his woman ?"
"we talked every night after her show no matter what time it was , that was a stipulation that i 'd made before she left ."
"she could get away during the day because i knew she was busy with rehearsals , but at night i needed to know that she was safe ."
"we did facetime until she fell asleep ; each night , i could see that my baby was exhausted but she seemed to be having fun ."
"there was a lot of buzz in the headlines about her shows but i did n't listen or read any of it ."
"that was until two days before she was due back ."
"my assistant was reading one of those crappy magazines that were filled with half-truths and innuendo ."
"that 's how i 'd always seen them until i saw my woman walking out of some restaurant in italy with her ex ."
"i did n't want to fly off the handle ; the caption said the picture had been snapped the night before which had to mean it was before we 'd spoken and she had n't mentioned it to me ."
"my first instinct was to get on a plane and got drag her ass home after dealing with both of them , but common sense and rationality won out ."
"i could n't go half way around the world to kill her ."
"no , i 'll wait 'til she gets back and strangle her ass in the privacy of our own home ."
"that night when she called , she still did n't mention it and i played like nothing was wrong ."
"there was something in her voice but i was n't quite sure what it was ."
"`` so you 've got your final show tomorrow night yes ? ''"
"`` yes , and then i 'll be home . ''"
"`` i 'll be waiting . ''"
"the next night when she called , i did n't answer ."
"i 'd spent the whole day in a contained rage and had pretty much locked myself away in my office ."
"i 'd come to terms with the fact that i did n't believe for a second that she 'd cheated on me , but whatever reason she had for being with him was not good enough ."
"and the fact that she had n't mentioned it to me , only infuriated me more ."
"she was home when i got in the next day ."
"when she ran to me and jumped into my arms i held her close but did n't kiss her ."
"she knew something was wrong and her eyes followed me across the room ."
"`` is something wrong ? ''"
"`` is there something you want to tell me shiane ? ''"
"she looked at me at sea ."
"i pulled out the magazine i 'd had hidden in the drawer of the little side table and threw it at her ."
"her eyes widened when she saw it and she looked up at me with fear in her eyes ."
"`` it 's not what it looks like ."
"i can explain . ''"
"i walked away from her and into the bedroom to remove my jacket and tie where she followed me a few seconds later ."
"`` trace ... '' `` were you the one that was afraid of me cheating on you ? ''"
"she 'd never seen me this way before , so she had no way of knowing that the precise movements and contained tone was a sure sign that her ass was in trouble ."
"`` but i did n't cheat , he was on tour because we have a few duets together and ... '' `` and you did n't tell me this because ... '' `` i did n't want to cause any problems . ''"
"she looked down at the floor and rung her hands ."
"`` and the restaurant ? ''"
"`` everyone was there that night . ''"
"`` did you talk to him ? ''"
"`` i ... '' i saw the answer in the guilty look in her eyes ."
"`` take off your clothes . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"`` now . ''"
"she jumped and reached for the buttons on her shirt ."
"i was naked by now and walked around to my closet ."
"i came back out with my leather strap and she took one look at it and tried to make a run for it ."
"`` you do n't really want to make this any worst than it already is do you ? ''"
"that stopped her in her tracks but she was still halfway out of the room ."
"`` come here ... do n't make me have to tell you again shiane . ''"
"i almost caved when she turned big tear filled eyes my way ."
"she took a deep breath to fortify herself and then walked slowly towards me with her head down ."
"i did n't turn her over my knee ."
"i was too angry for that ."
"instead , i brought the belt down across her ass and thighs as she hopped from foot to foot pleading with me to stop ."
"`` please trace nothing happened . ''"
"`` i do n't want to hear it , you had your chance to tell me this shit before you left here . ''"
"i gave her a good twenty hard blows with the belt until she was a crying slobbering mess ."
"still not satisfied i left her there crying and walked out of the room ."
"i went for a long drive to cool down but by the time i got back , i was still no better than when i left ."
"she was in the middle of our bed with her arm locked around her bent knees rocking back and forth ."
"we looked at each other but i still was n't ready to talk to her ."
"i felt betrayed ; it was a new feeling for me ."
"it had been a long time since anyone had had the guts to cross me ."
"i headed into the shower in the hopes that the water would help to soothe my ragged nerves but no luck ."
"she was wearing my old tee shirt , which she 'd taken with her when she 'd left ."
"`` lose the shirt . ''"
"she hurried to comply though i noticed her eyes fell to my hands to make sure she was n't about to get another whipping ."
"i climbed onto the bed and turned her around roughly ."
"in the three weeks we 'd bee together , as hard as i 'd been f**king her , i 'd always held something back , but not tonight , tonight i was going to give her the f**king i 've been dying to but did n't because her little pu**y was still having trouble taking my cock ."
"i did n't take the time to prepare her , this was a punishment after all , i planned to use her body tonight for my own pleasure until i 'd freed myself of this burning rage ."
"i had her bent over in the middle of the bed , her legs spread , head down and her pu**y in the air ."
"licking my fingers i ran them roughly over her pu**y , dipping my middle finger into her wet heat before straddling her from behind ."
"i did n't knee behind her , that would n't achieve my aim ."
"i stood with my legs on either side of hers , slightly bent ."
"from this angle i could drill down into her ."
"i 'm sure it would be a little harder for her to take me in this position but i really could give a f**k at this point ."
"i ran my c**k ring up and down her slit until she started to get wet , then i slammed into her only giving her about half my length ."
"she screamed into the mattress and her body shook but i did n't stop pounding until i was balls deep in her upturned pu**y ."
"grabbing a fistful of her hair , i pulled her head back until i could see down into her eyes ."
"i saw pain , but there was lust there as well as i battered her pu**y with my cock ."
"when i felt her clenching , i pulled out and left her panting ."
"she looked over her shoulder at me but she did n't have the nerve to say anything to me ."
"when i was sure she was n't about to cum , i screwed my c**k back into her , pulling her ass up higher to keep her at the angle i wanted ."
"i kept pulling out to tease her with the piercing in the end of my c**k because i knew how much she loved that , but not giving her enough to get her off ."
"the hoarse cries told me that i was hurting her , even as her pu**y got wetter and wetter ."
"`` please trace . ''"
"`` not another f**king word . ''"
"i tugged on her hair for emphasis and she bit her lip ."
"she could n't hide the f**k me noises that seemed to come from her gut , and her pu**y was on fire ."
"i love those noises she made as i f**ked into her my c**k ring was hitting her just right and she started pushing back trying to get more of my twelve inches inside her ."
"as pissed as i was i held off though , because i knew her tight little pu**y could n't handle too much in this position , not so soon , it was going to take lots of f**king before that could happen without me tearing her ."
"i pulled out and licked into her pu**y , going deep , she screamed and came in my mouth before i climbed back onto my feet and fed her eight inches of my meat ."
"that 's as deep as i could go before bottoming out inside her with her ass high in the air ."
"`` as soon as i 've broken in your tight little pu**y , i 'm going to ass f**k you . ''"
"she clenched around me and came again ."
"i was n't anywhere near cumming so i settled in for a nice long f**k. her body was still shaking and her cries were dying down to low moans ."
"she tried getting her hand under her to touch her sore pu**y but a hard smack on her ass stopped her in her tracks ."
"`` do n't do it . ''"
"finally , i lowered her ass just a little and dropped to my knees behind her and the movement sent me all the way into her ."
"it triggered another one of her magnificent climaxes and she squeezed my c**k like a vise ."
"i bit into the flesh of her back to her neck before pulling her head back and to the side for my tongue ."
"`` i love you trace . ''"
"that stopped me mid stroke , the shock of it , but that did n't last too long ."
"`` i love you too , but this is n't about that ."
"you f**ked up ."
"i 'm pissed as f**k at you . ''"
"i brought her off three more times until i felt my balls draw up to my body in preparation to blast ."
"`` you do n't deserve my seed . ''"
"i pulled out and pushed her away from me ."
"she turned around in time to watch me jerk my seed into the sheets ."
"her cry of dismay cut through the air as i climbed off the bed and headed to the shower ."
"i was only in there two minutes when i felt her come in and stand in front of me ."
"i kept my head back and eyes closed as i ran the cloth over my chest ."
"`` trace , i 'm so sorry ."
"i was n't thinking ."
"i wo n't do it again ."
"i promise . ''"
"she was crying as her hands came up to touch me tentatively ."
"i finished my shower without saying a word to her and walked away ."
"i stripped the bed after drying myself off and putting on a pair of boxers ."
"she was coming out of the shower by the time i was finished remaking the bed she looked at me as i passed her and left the room ."
"in the kitchen , i ignored the dinner she 'd made and made myself a sandwich before shutting myself away in my private office ."
"it was hours before i felt human again ."
"i 'd called the detail i 'd had following her unbeknownst to her and got the same story from them ."
"that eased my anger some but there was still the issue of why she did n't tell me that her ex was going to be on this trip ."
"from what they 'd said , he 'd been hounding her the whole time she was there but she 'd seemed disinterested ."
"like i said , i never thought she 'd cheated on me with him ; i still did n't want her having anything at all to do with him ."
"along with that , the reports on her manager were n't looking too good ."
"it was just as i 'd suspected , he was using the young girl for his own gains ."
"she had been robbed of a good three million dollars in the two years she 'd been signed ."
"money from different venues that i 'm sure she was n't even aware of ."
"she was n't hurting for money , not by a long shot , but still it was n't for him or anyone else to rip her off ."
"before i confronted him though , i was still waiting for the results of the in depth investigation of everyone that had anything to do with her career ."
"she was curled into a ball on my side of the bed when i finally upstairs hours later ."
"i stood over her for the longest time until i felt my heart settle ."
"i would n't have chosen a moment of anger in which to tell her that i loved her , but she 'd chosen the time and place ."
"now it was out there , i 'd shown her my heart , as well as giving it to her ."
"we could never go back now , from here on out we were one and for me that meant a whole lot of shit ."
"she 'd only gotten a taste of the man tonight , if she f**ked up in the future it could be worst ."
"turning away , i walked to my side and climbed in with my back to her ."
"she must 've gravitated to me in her sleep , because i woke before the sun the next day to find her curled into my back ."
"lifting my arm , i turned and pulled her into my arms ."
"she was barely awake when i turned her to her back and slipped into her wet heat ."
"she clutched at me in her sleep before she came fully awake ."
"`` trace ... '' her voice was that of a little girl lost ."
"`` shh , it 's okay i 'm here . ''"
"i pushed her hair back so i could look into her eyes as i stroked my c**k in and out of her ."
"`` wrap your legs around me princess . ''"
"she lifted her legs around my waist pulling me in deeper ."
"i never took my eyes off of hers ; i wanted to see what was there , what words could never say because there were n't enough ."
"when i came i captured her lips with mine and accepted her moans into my lungs as she gave me her sweet nectar ."
"`` i love you . ''"
"she tightened around me and cried out at my admission ."
"chapter 8 things settled down somewhat after that and we lived a life of peaceful bliss for the next month and a half ."
"i took her away on my jet for long weekends ."
"we played , we laughed we enjoyed each other and the more time went by , the more in love with her i became ."
"i no longer questioned the strangeness of our meeting , or why it had been so easy for me to make the decisions i had after so many years of living and thinking one way ."
"she was my beautiful girl , the owner of my heart ."
"her career was doing extremely well , her records were going platinum all over the place and she was in high demand ."
"she had another local show coming up this weekend ."
"this time i was ready when she approached my hesitantly to let me know that her ex was going to be performing at the show ."
"i had had time to prepare myself since i 'd already gotten a line-up of what was in store for that night ."
"i 've been following her career since the day we met and now i have all the information i needed to send her manager and a couple lawyers to jail ."
"i have n't told her what i 'd found as yet ."
"did n't want to upset her this close to her performance and i 'd only just got the last of the result ."
"it had taken this long because the lawyers had been very slick with their thievery ."
"too bad for them i know how to follow the money trail , all i need is the scent ."
"i planned to tell her this weekend after the show though and i already had my lawyers on standby to take care of shit ."
"shiane trace has been so unbelievably amazing in the last month or so ."
"it 's like everyday he goes out of his way to relieve my fears ."
"maybe it 's because we were able to keep our romance out of the public eye , but i was having more fun being in love with him than i 'd ever thought possible ."
"i decided to take a page out of his book and try to really get to know him ."
"i 'd watch him when he was n't looking , and paid attention to the little things , like how he shielded my body with his whenever we were going somewhere ."
"how he always seemed to have to touch me whenever we were together no matter where we were ; or the way he 'd run his hand through my hair absentmindedly while we sat together watching a movie ."
"i especially loved the way he made love to me ."
"ever since that night when he 'd punished me , which now when i think back on it was hot as hell ; he 's been this super boyfriend though it seems kinda weird thinking of him in that way , he 's so much more than a boy ."
"i 'd told my family about him and dad and him had had a few private conversations over the last few weeks that i was n't privy to , but my family seemed to love and accept him even with the age difference ."
"now i have a show coming up tonight and i 'm more nervous than usual ."
"not because of the show itself , no , trace had taken care of that as ell ."
"he 'd found this lady that specialized in curing people like me ."
"she just put me through this series of exercises that helped to calm me down before each appearance ."
"it was an ongoing process but so far it seemed to be working ."
"i no longer had that sick fear of bombing on stage ."
"no tonight 's fear stemmed from the fact that donnie was there and i knew form our last one sided conversation that he was going to try to get back with me again ."
"because trace and i had been able to keep our relationship hidden , he along most of the known world were under the impression that i was still pining for him ."
"then there were the rumors of us sneaking around together ."
"one tabloid had gone so far as to print that very suggestion ."
"i thought trace would lose his mind ."
"he 'd gone on a tear even going so far as to call up someone to handle the retraction and fire the person responsible ."
"i guess it was n't just the speculation that had sent him over the edge , but the fact that there was a photo shopped picture from the year before of me and donnie , only this one was made to look like it was more recent and well , let 's just say it did n't sit well with trace to see his woman as he put it , lip locked with some other dick ."
"apparently whatever he 'd done had worked because the following week there had been a retraction and an apology ."
"will wonders never cease ?"
"of course now we were down to crunch time ."
"he 'd said that he was fine with the whole show deal but as the time drew nearer i could see that tic in his jaw working overtime ."
"all i could do was hope for the best ."
"`` shiane baby come in here . ''"
"trace her show was in a couple hours and she 'd have to leave soon for prep ."
"i 'd made peace with the fact that she was going to be sharing the stage with the ass**le ex for part of tonight 's show ."
"although i 'd told her that i was fine , the truth is that i 'm not the kind of man who could ever be okay with such a thing , but the contracts had been signed long before i came on the scene and it was her career ."
"i was going to make sure that this was the last time though ."
"after this series of engagements were over , there will never be another occasion when she would be allowed even in the same room as the prick ."
"she came into room already dressed to leave ."
"i did n't say anything to her as i pulled her into my arms and fed her my tongue ."
"my hand went down to her pu**y and she opened her legs to give me easier access ."
"i rubbed her through her clothes as her breathing sped up and she smashed her tits into my naked chest ."
"wordlessly i started to strip her clothes away as my c**k grew and pr**cum started leaking from my tip ."
"i had her spread out on the bed with my head between her thighs as i ate her pu**y , making sure to sink my tongue as deep as i could as i fingered her ass ."
"over the past weeks i 've been preparing her ass for my cock ."
"she moaned and pushed her pu**y harder against my mouth ."
"her juices ran down to the crack of her ass lubricating her nicely ."
"standing from between her legs where her pink pu**y was on full display with her juices glistening and calling to me , i helped her onto her hands and knees in the middle of the bed ."
"i teased her pu**y slit with my c**k head until pushed her ass up higher and begged me to f**k her ."
"`` please trace . ''"
"i slapped her ass once hard and she looked over her shoulder at me ."
"her eyes were already glazed over and i knew she was already far-gone ."
"`` please what ? ''"
"`` fuck me , f**k my pu**y hard . ''"
"yes , that 's something else i 'd taught her , to be less inhibited in bed ."
"at first her shyness ruled her , but i soon had her saying and doing anything she loved ."
"i 'd explained to her that since i was the only sexual partner she 'd ever have for the rest of her life , who better to know what pleased her ?"
"and how will i know if she did n't tell me ?"
"that had opened up a whole new world to her , and i 'd learned a lot about my princess ."
"she had a bit of the submissive in her , she liked for her man to take charge , not just in the bedroom either ."
"it was perfect since i 'm a controlling bastard and make no bones about it ."
"i teased her pu**y some more before sinking my c**k all the way home ."
"she arched her back and came like she always does as soon as i enter her ."
"she says it 's because i hit her cervix each time and it triggers her ."
"i f**ked into her nice and slow , using my hand in her hair and the other on her hip to control her movements ."
"looking down between us i enjoyed the sight of my c**k covered in her pu**y cream as it went in and out of her ."
"`` your pu**y 's still so tight baby , f**k. '' she lowered her head to the mattress which sent her ass even higher into the air and had my c**k going in deeper and at a different angle ."
"getting to my feet , i released her hair so i could hold both her hips and pull her back hard on my c**k as her pu**y opened and closed around my cock ."
"i could see where my c**k was bulging out around the lips of her pu**y , the way they pulled out when i came out and folded in when i f**ked back in ."
"i knew she still could n't too much of a pounding in this position so it was slow going until she juiced all over my cock ."
"i did n't want to cum in her pu**y just yet though i had other plans for tonight ."
"pulling out after she 'd come down , i licked her pu**y deep while using my fingers to rub our mixed juices into her tight ass**le ."
"she flinched and moaned as she pushed back against my fingers trying to get me to go deeper ."
"i probably should 've used a little sex toy on her ass to prepare her for my twelve inch cock , but i did n't want even a fake dick anywhere near her ."
"reaching off to the side i got the lube and oiled up my cock ."
"she looked over her shoulder to see what i was doing and her eyes widened ."
"`` trace ? ''"
"`` shh , it 's okay . ''"
"i ran my hands up and down her back around to her tits where i pulled and pinched them the way she likes ."
"i kept letting my c**k tap into her pu**y lips and her clit , which kept her preoccupied ."
"when i was sure she was ready , i leaned over her back , then i had a thought ."
"`` did he f**k you in the ass ? ''"
"i had wrapped my hand around her throat unknowingly , it was only when she shook her head no that i realized what i 'd done ."
"i did n't think she 'd ever anal before but i wanted to be sure , it was the reason i 'd chosen tonight after all ."
"satisfied with her answer , i guided my c**k as gently as i could to her ass ."
"she was tight as was to be expected so i had to take me time and work my c**k into her ass in one-inch increments ."
"she tensed and her body tried to expel me but i soothed her with soft kisses around her ear and down her neck , whispering how beautiful she was and how much i loved her ."
"her ass relaxed enough for me to get a few inches in her and then i started the f**king motion in and out of her ."
"i 'm not really big on anal sex , but it was enjoyable on some occasions ."
"the more she relaxed , the more dick i fed her until i was balls deep in her ass ."
"she was really getting into it now pushing her ass back hard against me until i was lying flat on her back pressing her into the bed ."
"her ass was the tightest f**king thing i 'd ever felt around my cock , and that was saying something because my baby has a tight cunt ."
"`` when you 're on stage with him , i want you to remember who you belong to . ''"
"i slammed into her ass and her mouth opened in a soundless scream ."
"i f**ked her to two orgasms but i myself did n't want to cum in her ass ."
"instead i pulled out and with a stern 'stay as you are ' , went into the bathroom to clean off my rock hard cock ."
"coming back to the bed , i rolled her over onto her back and climbed between her legs pushing them farther apart with my hips ."
"i looked down at what i was doing as i led my c**k into her pu**y again ."
"i did n't hurry ; i knew i was f**king with her because she should 've been gone half an hour ago ."
"i did n't care ; this was my way of showing her who was in charge ."
"`` trace , we have to hurry i have to ... '' i caught her neck in my hand and surged into her hard ."
"`` do n't rush me , we 're through when i say we are . ''"
"i kissed her then , sending my tongue deep into her as i f**ked her nice and slow making her forget that she was way late ."
"she f**ked back at me her hips going wild as i kept teasing her with small strokes instead of the pounding she needed ."
"`` if he touches you , i 'll kill him . ''"
"she looked into my eyes before hers rolled back in her head and she came ."
"it was soon too much for me and though i did n't pound away at her like i always want to , i f**ked her to another climax as my balls unloaded in her womb ."
"i bit into her neck just as the last of my sperm was spilling into her ."
"i smirked down at my handy work ."
"let the little f**k think about that ."
"chapter 9 she sat practically in my lap in the car on the way to the venue ."
"her manager was not pleased to say the least and started in screaming until i told him to get f**ked ."
"`` who are you ?"
"hey are n't you ... '' i did n't bother to answer the f**ker as he stared from me to her and back ."
"she headed off to do her thing and i walked away from him , i was n't ready to deal with him right now ."
"i stood around backstage until it was almost time for the show to begin then went out and took my seat in the front row ."
"i 'd debated on whether or not this was a good idea , watching her perform with him , but in the end she 'd pleaded with me to come ."
"i guess it was best if i were here in the flesh to see what the hell the performance was like than reading about it second hand in some rag ."
"the buzz was that they were dy***ite on the stage , that they had great chemistry and all that other bullshit ."
"i settled in for a long night ."
"i felt a huge sense of pride when she came out the first time and the crowd went wild ."
"this was a much larger crowd than the one from the night we met and the whole place was on their feet ."
"you would never know that less than two hours ago i had her bent over ."
"she did n't look at all nervous and in fact seemed to be glowing ."
"it was halfway through , when i 'd finally felt the tension leave me and had relaxed and start to enjoy the show that he joined her on stage ."
"the song was one of those dual tone numbers , slow in parts and fast in others ."
"i felt my fist fold the first time he had to get real close to her as they faced each other across the microphones ."
"then ensued a sort of cat and mouse dance ."
"he kept trying to put his arms around her waist or on her hip ."
"i was n't sure if that was part of the actual dance routine or just him being an ass , but the first time she threw a panicked look my way i knew it was a bit of both ."
"the crowd seemed to read something else into it , as it appeared that she was playing hard to get , evading his roving hands and prancing away as she continued singing , only to be followed by him time and again ."
"each time our eyes met i kept my face neutral , i did n't want to spoil her performance and like i said if this was part of her job then so be it ."
"but what i did n't like was the way he tried to manhandle her on the stage when it had nothing to do with their routine ."
"do n't ask me how i knew those times so well ."
"i was reading her body language sure , but each time it happened she 'd send me a look and it would tip me off ."
"i was n't mad at her though , not really , but him i 'd like to stomp into the f**king mud ."
"i left my seat and headed backstage just before the last number ended ."
"i cold hear the roar of the crowd as she bid them goodnight for the second time after giving them the encore they 'd asked for ."
"i was in the shadows sort of , behind this huge potted plant , when she came back followed by the rest of the band , and the ass**le."
"``"
"hey i 'm talking to you . ''"
"he reached out to grab her arm and she pulled it out of his reach ."
"`` the show is over donnie we have nothing more to say to each other for the rest of the night . ''"
"`` that 's what you think ."
"where did you get this ? ''"
"he tried touching the mark i 'd left on her neck ."
"she slapped her hand over it and backed up ."
"`` that 's none of your business . ''"
"`` it is my business when my woman is sporting a hickey from some other dude . ''"
"`` your woman , are you insane ?"
"we 've been over for months now would you please get out of my way ? ''"
"she tried going around him and by this point i 'd seen all i needed to ."
"i started forward but before i could reach them he 'd reached out and grabbed her and was trying to kiss her ."
"the amazing this was that there were others heading backstage and no one seemed to witness the almost assault that was taking place right in front of them ."
"that could be because their voices had been kept low throughout this whole exchange ."
"as soon as his hand fisted in her blouse i was on him ."
"`` get the f**k off her ass**le . ''"
"i flung his hand away and got between the two of them ."
"you could say i was pissed but trying to contain it ."
"i was no longer angry about the display on stage , i knew that was all him and though the world might see a very well coordinated dance routine , that 's all that it was ."
"but this was something more , this was personal and this i would not allow ."
"`` who the f**k are you , shiane who 's this ass**le ?"
"is he new security ?"
"tell him who i am before i sue his ass . ''"
"`` listen you little shit , if you come anywhere near her again i 'll break every bone in your f**king body . ''"
"he looked at her wide eyed when he realized i meant every word ."
"then he stupidly reached out for her again , grabbing her hand this time and i saw red ."
"i punched him in the face until blood spurted from his mouth ."
"only the fact that he was so much younger than i , kept me from following through ."
"i grabbed her hand and pulled her out behind me mad as hell ."
"i did n't have a jacket to give her this time but thankfully she was more covered up ."
"`` did you leave anything back there that you needed ? ''"
"i asked her after we were in the back of the car on the way home ."
"she called one of her assistants to gather her shit ."
"that night i f**ked her like a beast , there was n't any part of her body that i did n't lick bite or kiss ."
"at one point she 'd cried because it was too much ."
"i ate her little pu**y until the sting was eased and then slid back into her ."
"we were both sore by the time i rolled away from her as the sun was rising ."
"dragging her into my arms i cuddled her as we slept ."
"the next day i was all over the f**king front page , just what i needed ."
"some hack had been there taking pictures of the whole thing and the story broke ."
"that 's how we were found out and since that night we could n't leave the house for weeks without a camera in our face ."
"things cooled down when they realized they were n't gon na get anything more from us and my security was very good at evading their asses ."
"they had no access to my private underground parking garage and since i had a whole fleet of cars to choose from they never knew which one we were in if i felt like taking my woman out for dinner ."
"since i did n't frequent the kind of establishments that catered to the paparazzi or that hired people who 'd tip them off to us being there , we were left relatively in peace after the hubbub had died down chapter 10 now it 's the night of the last show and she was pissing me off ."
"we 'd had an argument of sorts that morning , well i would n't call it an argument exactly but there was definitely some tension ."
"we were lazing around having breakfast doing our usual thing , which was something the therapist had told her was helpful for her anxiety ."
"i was reaching over to pour her some orange juice when she sideswiped me ."
"`` trace are we gon na get married ? ''"
"she caught me off guard with that one , coming out of the blue like that and i guess i did n't handle the situation to her liking ."
"`` why do n't we talk about this later after you 're done with the show ? ''"
"it was the best i could come up with on such short notice ."
"for some reason my answer pissed her off ."
"she 'd been showing her mettle a lot here lately once she realized i was n't the type to fold my fist and punch her in the face just for kicks ."
"after she asked me that she got all quiet for the rest of the day and when she was n't slamming shit around the house she was ignoring me ."
"i decided to leave her to her mad and do some work in my office ."
"two hours before she was due to leave i cornered her in the shower and f**ked her against the stall although she 'd tried to give me shit at first ."
"`` mine , you do n't tell me no ever no matter how f**king pissed you are . ''"
"i had my hand covering her wet crotch when i said that and moved it away to enter her swiftly ."
"as much of a fuss as she 'd made by the time i had her pinned to the wall , her legs were wrapped around my waist and her fingers were digging into my scalp as i f**ked her to within an inch of her life ."
"she 'd cleaned my c**k off after i 'd off loaded inside her the second time and we 'd cleaned each other up after so i was under the impression that she was over her mad ."
"now she pulled this f**king stunt ."
"we 'd had a few conversations about the way she dressed on stage and when she let it be known that she was n't too comfortable with some of the costumes either but her wardrobe people chose them , i 'd put my foot down ."
"her talent did n't need any gimmicks ."
"i did n't expect her to dress like a nun on stage but neither did i expect her to show her ass to the world , not when that ass was now the exclusive property of trace mckenzie ."
"i waited until the number was almost at an end and she would be headed backstage for a clothes change ."
"i caught her as soon as she got off the stage and while her helpers were waiting to help her change i dragged her off to the dressing room and locked the door ."
"`` your next outfit had better be something more presentable shiane , or i swear to f**k , i will drag your ass off that f**king stage and take you home . ''"
"`` do n't tell me how to do my job trace , i was doing this before we met and if you do n't like it ... '' my hand came up and went around her throat and i pulled her face close to mine ."
"`` watch what the f**k you say to me little girl , i 'm holding onto my temper by a thread , so unless you want me to heat up your little ass when we get home you 'd better quit while you 're ahead . ''"
"`` maybe i wo n't be going home with you . ''"
"she was pissed and obviously not thinking too clearly because of it or she would 've been more careful ."
"i laughed in her face ."
"`` try it , there is n't a hole or rock big enough to hide your ass ."
"and if you get any one of these f**kers around here to help you hide from me i will destroy the f**k. '' i kissed her hard enough to bruise her lips before leaving her there ."
"i knew what she wanted but she was just going to have to wait ."
"i 'm a man and for a man there 's always the right way and a wrong way to do things ."
"i headed back out my seat and that 's when she really did it ."
"i thought i 'd made my point when i saw the long dress with the slit up the front ."
"but then one of the male dancers came up behind her and wrapped his arm around her from behind while she sang to him and they did some sorta two- step dance ."
"then he did something with his hand and the dress was at her feet ."
"she kicked it out of the way as the crowd went wild ."
"she had the nerve to dead at me was she sang and then and shook her ass at the crowd ."
"i thought there was going to be a riot ."
"i sat there for the rest of the set until she left the stage for the last time ."
"by now my rage was a cool controlled anger simmering inside me ."
"i said nothing as i went backstage where everyone was congratulating her on her performance ."
"`` let 's go . ''"
"i walked over and took her elbow . ''"
"`` wait i have to ... '' one look at my face had her changing tact ."
"she swallowed hard and i could see from her expression that she was finally getting that she 'd gone too far ."
"all the way in the car i sat away from her while she kept shooting me furtive looks ."
"i kept my face straight ahead and my fists clenched as they hung between my thighs ."
"if i did anything else i 'm afraid i might strangle her ass ."
"as soon as we got through the doors of home i grabbed her arm and headed for the bedroom and straight to where i kept the belt i used to wail her ass ."
"`` stop trace you ca n't . ''"
"she tried to pulling away from me which only enraged me more ."
"i grabbed the belt and was about to bring it down over her ass , not even waiting to get her undressed i was so pissed ."
"`` i 'm pregnant . ''"
"well f**k , that sure stopped me in my tracks ."
"`` what did you say ? ''"
"`` you ca n't spank me , i 'm pregnant . ''"
"i dropped the belt and stared down at her ."
"there was something strange going on with my heart ."
"it was beating yes , but the rhythm was off somehow ."
"i felt a buzzing in my ears and i thin i lost sight there for a second ."
"`` you 're pregnant ? ''"
"i pulled her around to stand in front of me ."
"she nodded and looked down at her feet ."
"`` why did n't you tell me ? ''"
"`` i just found out , i was going to tell you , then i asked you that question this morning and you blew me off . ''"
"the memory seemed to renew her anger and she glared at me ."
"`` i was n't about to try to trap you with a baby , i do n't want to marry someone who does n't really want me for me , i 've had one ass**le in my life already . ''"
"i grabbed her neck and lifted her off her feet ."
"`` i told you never to throw that f**ker in my face ."
"just because you 're carrying my child do not think for one minute that i wo n't heat your little ass up ."
"`` what the f**k ever gave you the idea that i did n't want to marry you ? ''"
"`` you said ... '' she raised her voice and started to yell ."
"`` watch your f**king tone , you 're skating on thin f**king ice ."
"what the f**k ever gave you the idea that i 'm the kinda man who needs his woman to propose to him ?"
"that 's my place , not f**king yours no matter what some feminist new age f**k says . ''"
"`` well it did n't look like you were gon na ask , now if you do , i 'll always know it was only because of your precious child . ''"
"i dragged her into the closet and over to the safe i kept hidden there ."
"it took me a few tries to get the combination i was that f**king pissed ."
"opening the safe i retrieved the little velvet box i 'd kept there for months ."
"`` i bought this two days after we met ."
"i was waiting for you to be finished with this before giving it to you ."
"`` trace i ... '' `` save it , i told you once i wo n't pay for what that ass**le did to you ."
"not that that 's clear let 's talk about that shit you pulled tonight . ''"
"`` i thought you did n't want me , i thought ... '' `` so you thought to get back at me by doing something that was sure to piss me off ."
"just a warning for the future babe , you do not ever want to piss me off ."
"i 'll be lenient with you when it comes to certain things , but outright disobedience will not be acceptable , not now not ever ."
"`` you want me to leave your ass you pull a stunt like this again ."
"if i say no it means f**king no do you hear me ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"she mumbled ."
"`` i 'm sorry . ''"
"`` you 're too f**king spoilt for your own good ."
"i 'm not sure if i should let this slide , but i do n't want the news of my child 's conception to be marred by this f**kery , and since you 've spoiled my proposal you can live with that shit . ''"
"i took the box from her hand and put the five-carat diamond on her finger ."
"this was not how i 'd wanted this to go ."
"i 'd had everything planned out ."
"i was going to take her to paris since that was her favorite place and propose to her there in one of their over priced swanky restaurants ."
"that 's not my style but it 's hers so i was willing to do it to make the night special ."
"i did n't make love to her that night ."
"not because of any punishment or anything like that , i think i was just overwhelmed a little if you wan na know the truth ."
"i 'd gone from extremely pissed and ready to heat up her ass , to learning that i was going to be a daddy or a dad ."
"instead i helped her get ready for bed and held her as she gave into the fatigue of the long day and night ."
"once again i recalled my childhood , the always wanting , never having and never any hope of having ."
"and the hunger , humiliation , all the things you can expect from a young boy whose parents neglected him ."
"and then when lily came along , my beautiful little sister , i remembered the fear in my gut that i would n't be able to protect her ."
"she was the one and only baby i 'd ever held in my arms , and the love i 'd felt then , could n't be compared to what i felt for the unborn child shiane now kept safe in her womb ."
"i thought of her upcoming tour and knew there was no way i would let her go off on her own , not in her condition ."
"i came to the conclusion that it was time i delegated more at work ."
"i had men and women that i 'd hired , the best in their fields , sometimes straight out of college , but had yet to trust anyone to do what i did ."
"it was an easy decision to make now , whereas before the thought gave me cold sweats ."
"i took the hand with my ring on it and kissed her finger as i hoped and prayed that i would get this right , then being as gentle as i could and not awaken her ."
"i lowered my body until my lips were in line with her still flat stomach and made a promise to my son or daughter ."
"`` daddy will always be there little one , no matter what ; i ca n't wait to meet you . ''"
"i felt the tears gather at the corner of my eyes , and though it had been years since i 'd shed one , i let them fall ."
"my heart had never been so full in my life ."
"i held her until the dawn and that 's as long as i could hold out before taking her ."
"turning her silky soft body onto her back , i kissed my way down her body , stopping at her br**sts ."
"i took the nipple of first one into my mouth , licking and sucking , pulling strong as i imagined one day my baby would , before going to the other ."
"by the time i made my way down to her sweet cunt , she was writhing beneath me ."
"i licked her clit until it was peeping out from under its hood , then spreading her pu**y lips open , i closed my eyes and feasted on her flesh , her taste bursting into my mouth as i dug deep with my tongue ."
"sliding up her body , i slid into her going deep with one smooth thrust ."
"her eyes were sleep-warm as she looked up at me ."
"with my hands holding both sides of her head , i held it back so i could look into her eyes as i loved her ."
"`` i love knowing my child is inside you . ''"
"i let one of my handles cover her stomach between us for a brief moment before gathering her in close ."
"`` give me your mouth baby . ''"
"she lifted her lips to mine and we stayed like that , our lips locked together passionately as i worked my c**k in and out of her , her hips rising and falling with my thrusts ."
"it was the most amazing experience of my life so far , and there was so much more to come ."
"i 'll make sure of it ."
"epilogue he 's utterly unpredictable and totally insane my husband ."
"i do n't think i 've ever known a more volatile person in my life ."
"my dad was an easy going mild mannered man , sure he and mom had their tiffs over the years when we were growing up , but i doubt he 's ever done or said half the things has done to me ."
"like spanking her ass with a belt ."
"since my announcement of my pregnancy , he 's added one other element , over protectiveness ."
"do n't get me wrong , i love it , in fact i think i need it because my hormones have been out of whack from day one ; but i wondered how others would see him ."
"it started with my management team of all things , and a couple of the lawyers that handled my contracts ."
"the morning after our engagement , he 'd dropped the bombshell that they had been robbing me blind ."
"i 'd sat there dumbfounded , not having the first clue as to what i was supposed to do next ."
"`` do n't worry princess i 've got it covered . ''"
"'but how did they and why ? ''"
"`` the how is easy , you do n't know what you 're looking at when dealing with those things unless you 've done some kind of business class or you have someone reliable explain it to you . ''"
"he was right i guess , as a small town girl , seeing all those zeros on my account balance was enough for me , i was just happy doing what i loved most and the fact that i was actually being paid , well ."
"`` the why is that they 're greedy f**ks and they saw you coming a mile off . ''"
"i guess they never banked on trace mckenzie coming into my life and turning everything upside down ."
"i 'd wanted to do everything secretly after that , did n't want the brouhaha that would follow if the public got ahold of it ."
"trace wanted to burn them at the stake ."
"in the end he convinced me that it was best to go public so that they would n't be free to do it to others ."
"turns out that was the right call , because after the story broke , others had come forward after realizing that they too had been victims of these unscrupulous men ."
"my tour started when i was five months along ."
"trace somehow found the time to leave work for almost two months and accompany me ."
"i 'd had to do some rearranging which meant there were hardly any breaks in between cities , but i wanted to be done before i really started to show ."
"that 's when i saw the other side of him ."
"he 'd hired all new management for me when i told him i was n't sure what to look for ."
"he 'd threatened to fire my wardrobe staff until they had some kind of meeting and he got what he wanted ."
"in the end they 'd come up with more tasteful designs , though some of them were sexier than the ones i 'd worn before ."
"he was right you did n't have to be half naked on stage to get your point across ."
"one day we were sitting at the kitchen table , i was still sitting in his lap because we 'd just made love while our breakfast had grown cold ."
"as he slipped out of my body i 'd said , 'you know we can do the proposal thing over ' ."
"he 'd given me one of his looks and that was that ."
"i guess that ship had sailed ."
"i ca n't say that i felt deprived though , because in every way he was the perfect fiance and then husband ."
"our wedding was a very private affair in my hometown ."
"he 'd moved heaven and earth to make it so and it was beautiful ."
"he was completely fascinated with my body these days , especially after i started to show ."
"there was n't a day that went by that he did n't spend at least an hour playing with my tummy and having these long drawn out conversations with whoever was in there ."
"now though , i think he 'd reached his limit ."
"`` trace it hurts . ''"
"he leaned over me as he held my hand in his and brushed my hair back with the other ."
"`` i know baby , i know it will be better soon ."
"do something . ''"
"that last was said to the doctor and nurses that were there in the delivery room ."
"he had n't shouted the words that they carried more force than if he had ."
"the way he seethed them through clenched teeth and glared at the room 's occupants ."
"if i were n't in so much pain i would 've found it funny ."
"`` she 's coming along just fine mr. mckenzie ."
"just one more push shiane , that 's a good girl . ''"
"i bore down with all my might as trace held my hand and whispered in my ear how proud he was of me and how beautiful i was ."
"i think it was his voice more so than anything urging from the doctor that gave me the extra boost i needed to push my son out into the world ."
"i laughed and cried as i heard his loud wails fill the room ."

CHUNK 1:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"trace never took his eyes off mine until the oh-oh from the doctor ."
"`` oh-oh ?"
"no f**king oh-oh , what the f**k is oh-oh ? ''"
"he was ready to tear the poor woman 's head off before she explained ."
"i was in too much of a daze from the new pain wracking my body to help ."
"`` looks like we have another one . ''"
"and so my daughter was born , totally unexpected but completely loved ."
"the end chapter one i bounce from foot to foot as i try my mom 's cell phone one more time ."
"i 'm practically bursting at the seams wanting to tell her my good news , and she 's not answering ."
"i hang up the call as it goes to her voicemail again ."
"she 's been a little more unreachable ever since she started dating this new mystery man ."
"she 'll have to break down and tell me about him soon-we 've never been able to keep secrets from one another for long ."
"i give up and hold down the number 2 button on my old flip-phone to auto-dial my best friend allison ."
"thankfully , she picks up ."
"`` i got it !"
"i got a lawn room ! ''"
"i shriek as soon as she answers , my excitement overflowing into a wild jig around my tiny dorm room ."
"allison screams on the other end in response-she knows what a huge deal this is for me ."
"there are only fifty-four lawn rooms at the university of virginia , where i 'm just finishing my junior year ."
"they were a central part of thomas jefferson 's design for the school , and spread out under white columns from his famous rotunda ."
"they might be small and drafty , but living in one is a high honor ."
"there 's a rigorous application process , and they are given to only the most academically-deserving rising seniors ."
"i worked my nerdy butt off in preparation for this moment , and i can barely believe it 's actually happening ."
"`` wait , wait , i 'm putting you on speaker ."
"miriam 's here , too , '' allison says when she finally takes a breath ."
"miriam is the third member of our little group that i met freshman year , and has both supported me and sheltered me through the first three years of college ."
"`` brynn , i 'm so proud of you !"
"i mean , think of how many hundreds and hundreds of hours you worked for this moment ! ''"
"she gushes ."
"i laugh ."
"`` do n't remind me ! ''"
"i wince , thinking of how much of college life i 've missed while huddled in the back stacks of the library ."
"not that miriam and allison are academic slouches either , far from it , all three of us could probably draw you a map of the library from memory ."
"`` and if it gets too cold in the winter , you can always come crash with us , '' allison adds ."
"she and miriam have been roommates since sophomore year , and will be again next year ."
"they 've always invited me to apply for housing with them , but after freshman year , i decided i was too much of an introvert for roommates ."
"`` the fireplace is probably the best and worst part of the whole thing , '' i laugh ."
"the lawn rooms have almost no trappings of the modern world , so in the winter all you have to keep yourself warm is your own personal fireplace ."
"it sounds romantic now , but come next january , i imagine i might feel differently ."
"`` are you working tonight ?"
"or can we celebrate ? ''"
"miriam asks ."
"i work in the cafeteria as part of my work-study program to offset the cost of my tuition ."
"`` maybe we could go to dinner together , then see a movie ? ''"
"`` well , i 'm not working , '' i admit , guilt already bubbling up from my stomach , `` but i was thinking i might go out with these girls from my poli-sci class . ''"
"there 's a short silence before allison speaks ."
"`` oh , cool ... sounds fun ."
"what are you guys going to do ? ''"
"`` um , they invited me to this party at the crew house , '' i say , beginning to tug on the ends of my dark blonde hair-a nervous habit that only really gets out of control during finals ."
"`` the crew house !"
"? ''"
"allison exclaims , and i ca n't help but roll my eyes at her theatrics ."
"`` brynn , you know as well as we do that those parties get insane !"
"i heard that last semester nine of their varsity members got alcohol poisoning in one night ! ''"
"`` well , there are only eight on a team , so i think that might be an exaggeration , '' i murmur ."
"`` though i suppose maybe an alternate- '' `` brynn , the point is , those parties are notoriously crazy , '' miriam cuts in ."
"`` i just want to see for myself , '' i say , trying to keep the frustration out of my voice ."
"`` i 'll call you guys tomorrow morning . ''"
"`` ok ... '' allison says warily ."
"`` bye ! ''"
"i say quickly , before miriam can renew her argument , and hang up ."
"as wonderful as my two best friends are , i do get tired of how uptight they can be sometimes ."
"not that i do n't understand where it comes from ."
"the three of us were n't exactly popular during high school , and when we found each other during our freshman year orientation , it was such an amazing relief to be with like-minded girls ."
"we were all serious students , driven , with a penchant for fantasy books that might star viggo mortensen in the movie adaption ."
"but now , i 'm beginning to chafe at the boundaries of our friendship ."
"particularly when it comes to going out to parties , and boys ."
"on my early morning trips to the library , i see girls doing the walk of shame across campus , their makeup smeared across their faces , hair rumpled , and first i feel pity , and then intense jealousy ."
"that post-sex glazed over look ... if i 'm honest with myself , i want that too ."
"and i promised myself that if i got my lawn room , i 'd go to a party ."
"a real college party ."
"the kind miriam and allison roll their eyes at as they wonder how many brain cells its attendees are killing by the second ."
"this crew party is the perfect opportunity ."
"i 'm trying not to get my hopes up , but it remains a possibility that i might actually get to talk to nate thornhill tonight ."
"just the thought of his name is enough to send tingles down my spine , though i know the real-life man could probably never live up to the fantasy i 've built up in my mind ."
"i still remember the first time i saw him , walking across campus the second weekend of fall semester of freshman year ."
"i would 've bet my life then that he was a senior ."
"compared to the boys i had just left behind in high school , he was already a full-grown man ."
"he wore a navy blue polo like it was a second skin as he strode across the grass , jefferson 's palladian architecture spread out behind him like it was built as a set for a movie he was starring in ."
"he wore his wavy brown hair on the long side , and pushed back to keep it out of his dark blue eyes ."
"his nose was perfectly straight and ended over a pair of soft , full lips and a chin with an actual dimple in it ."
"if it were possible for ryan gosling and a kennedy to have a baby , the result would be nate thornhill ."
"i later learned that he was a double major like me , and since one of mine is political science and one of his is history , we overlapped in a few of our core courses ."
"i expected him to sit in the back with the rest of the jocks but he was always in the front row , quick to raise his hand with intelligent answers ."
"i always hide right in the center of the halls ; my shyness overwhelms me in those big lecture classes ."
"i 've never got up the courage to actually talk to him , and besides , he always has a different girl on his arm ."
"with his looks , money , and being a star of both the lacrosse and crew teams , he draws women in like a magnet ."
"but tonight ?"
"tonight i have promised myself that if he 's at the party , i am going to introduce myself ."
"i shoot off a quick text to cara , my new friend from class , to confirm that i 'll join her tonight , and then turn to my closet ."
"i really only have one option to wear tonight : a simple , slinky black camisole with a lace inlay that i bought at the mall in spite of miriam and allison 's naysaying ."
"i did n't know what i was buying it for then , but it 's the kind of shirt i 've seen other girls wearing to parties ."
"i slip on jeans and a pair of heels that are probably a little low to be cool , but they 'll have to do ."
"it 's not like i have extra money to be adding to my wardrobe ."
"i take out the drug store makeup that i bought and sit at my desk ."
"i never usually wear anything but chapstick , but i watched some youtube tutorials and feel confident i can mimic some of the techniques ."
"with a compact mirror , i carefully put on a little concealer , blush , brown eye shadow , and black mascara ."
"i bought an eyeliner , but i do n't use it ."
"i think it 's a little beyond my skills ."
"with a swipe of some sparkly lip gloss , i 'm done ."
"i close the closet door and study myself in the full-length mirror ."
"with a start , i recognize myself in the reflection ."
"i turn my face side to side , searching for all its imperfections ."
"with a little makeup on , my resemblance to my mom is more pronounced ."
"everyone always says she is beautiful , so maybe it 's possible that i might be pretty , too ."
"the shirt is more low-cut than i remembered , and i touch my breasts self-consciously ."
"i get my large c-cups from my mom also , but i 've always kept them covered up ."
"i see how men get distracted by them , like they 're some tractor beam pulling them in ."
"one more quick glance to check my mascara application , and i nod at myself , satisfied ."
"it 's been a long time coming , but i think i 'm finally ready to party ."
"chapter two the spring night air is warm on my face as i walk across campus to meet cara and her friends ."
"i pass other students heading out for the night and feel happy to count myself among them ."
"i go over my rules for myself as i near the crew house , which is just across the street from campus ."
"no more than three drinks ."
"no talking about classes ."
"no weirdness around nate thornhill ."
"`` brynn ! ''"
"cara yells from the opposite sidewalk ."
"i wave as i head over ."
"`` i ca n't believe you got a lawn room !"
"that 's amazing ! ''"
"i lean over to give her a hug ."
"she 's an effortlessly cool , petite brunette-the kind of girl that everyone considers to be their friend ."
"`` thanks ! ''"
"`` holy shit !"
"you got a lawn room ?"
"are you , like , a genius or something ? ''"
"her friend rachel asks , her jaw dropping ."
"`` i wish !"
"then all those papers would have taken me way less time to write , '' i reply with a laugh ."
"`` cara says you 've never been to a crew party ? ''"
"marie , the knockout of the group , asks ."
"`` nope ... just never made my way over here i guess , '' i reply , downplaying the situation ."
"`` well , they have the best parties , '' she assures me ."
"`` and the hottest guys . ''"
"`` lacrosse guys are hotter , '' rachel argues ."
"`` of course , if you can always do both ... '' marie murmurs , and they burst into laughter ."
"`` hey , you look great , by the way , '' cara says to me as we walk up the front steps of the house ."
"`` love that top . ''"
"`` thanks , '' i say , trying not to glow ."
"a couple guys chilling on the front porch greet the other girls by name , and i blush as i feel their eyes glance over me ."
"i tug my hair self-consciously as one of them grins at me ."
"two girls hurry past us in the opposite direction ."
"one leans over the railing as her friend barely manages to pull her hair back before she retches into the bushes ."
"lovely ."
"sweat and the scent of beer greets us as we walk inside ."
"the lights are dim , barely illuminating the mass of people crowded into the main room , and i feel my heels sticking to the sticky floor ."
"`` cara , the love of my life ! ''"
"a tall , brawny guy says , sweeping her up into a hug ."
"i recognize him from the crew team ."
"not that i 've studied their roster photos or anything ... `` oh , ha , ha , '' cara says , rolling her eyes , though something about the gleam in her eyes tells me she likes the guy ."
"`` can i get you ladies a beer ? ''"
"he asks , nodding to the keg behind him ."
"`` yes , please , '' cara says ."
"`` hey , foster , this is my good friend brynn ."
"this is her first crew party so treat her nice . ''"
"`` i 'm always nice ! ''"
"foster says indignantly , then bows in front of me and offers his hand ."
"`` m'lady , '' he says , as i place my hand in his and raises it to his lips ."
"marie and rachel giggle and then head over to another group as foster hands them their beers ."
"cara and i follow foster over to an old , mysteriously stained , couch in the corner ."
"we weave around other scantily clad co-eds , and for the first time in my life , i feel like one of the cool kids ."
"i perch nervously on the far left cushion as cara sits next to me , with foster on her other side ."
"i slowly sip my beer as he whispers in her ear ."
"i 've had beer before , even gotten tipsy a few times with allison and miriam when we first turned twenty-one and tried out some wine bars ."
"i just want to make sure i do n't overdo it tonight and end up like that girl we passed on the way inside ."
"`` where 's nate tonight ? ''"
"my head whips around as i hear cara ask foster the question ."
"my heart stops for a second ."
"i have to admit i 'll feel crushed if he 's not even here ."
"`` he 's somewhere around , probably getting crushed under a pile of chicks , '' foster rolls his eyes , and cara laughs ."
"i down half my beer ."
"i ca n't believe how jealous it makes me feel , i 've never even met the guy ."
"cara and foster keep chatting , and though cara makes an effort to include me , i 'm feeling too nervous to contribute much to the conversation ."
"by the time i finish my beer , i really have to pee ."
"`` be right back , '' i murmur to cara , and go looking for the bathroom ."
"i weave through the sweaty throng to a hallway along the stairs ."
"i see a line of five girls outside of what i assume is the bathroom , and with a sigh , i step behind the last one ."
"the door opens and a guy darts in front of the front girl ."
"`` hey ! ''"
"she protests ."
"`` sorry !"
"emergency ! ''"
"he cries , and shuts the door behind him ."
"i lean back a little and glance up the stairs ."
"there are several people hanging out on the landing , but it 's definitely quieter up there , and i 'm sure there 's more than one bathroom in this place ."
"holding my legs close together , i turn around and hurry up the stairs ."
"i bypass the first couple rooms with open doors and come to a couple closed ones ."
"i can see a room at the end of the hall that looks like a lounge , with a pool table in the middle of the room ."
"one of these two rooms must be the bathroom ."
"i lean toward the nearest one and press my ear against it ."
"i ca n't hear anything ."
"i knock softly and wait for a reply , and when i do n't hear one , i slowly turn the knob and open the door ."
"i gasp as it 's pulled open and out of my grasp ."
"my eyes fly up and immediately i realize that nate is standing before me ."
"`` i ... i ... ''"
"i stammer ."
"his pupils dilate as he stares at me in amusement ."
"i let my gaze fall down his body ."
"he 's naked but for a pair of pale blue boxers ."
"good lord , his body is ridiculous ."
"the line down between his six-pack looks like it was etched in stone ."
"it 's suddenly very difficult to breathe ."
"`` see anything you like ? ''"
"he asks drily ."
"i snap my gaze back up ."
"a brown curl of hair hangs just over one of his eyes ."
"i clear my throat as i try to think of something to say ."
"i feel his eyes travelling over my body , my skin burning under his gaze as desire begins to pool in my stomach ."
"`` oh , no , i was- '' `` you wan na join us ? ''"
"he says , pulling the door open a little more ."
"i glance over his shoulder and see a naked girl in bed covered in rumpled sheets ."
"`` nate ! ''"
"the girl says with a giggle , and pulls a sheet up over her breasts ."
"`` come on ."
"if i were n't already naked , i 'd say you were undressing me with your eyes , '' he says smugly to me ."
"i feel my cheeks turn scarlet ."
"`` no , sorry , '' i murmur , averting my eyes and rushing down the hall to the stairs as i hear the girl dissolve into laughter behind me ."
"i run straight out of the front door and down the front steps before stopping on the sidewalk to process what 's just happened ."
"ugh , i 'm such an idiot ."
"i raise my hand to my mouth and wipe the back of my palm across my lips , smearing off my lip gloss ."
"i do n't belong at parties like this , and i certainly do n't belong with nate thornhill ."
"i 've never been so embarrassed in my life ... and how arrogant , asking me to join him and that girl as though i actually would ?"
"hot tears build up behind my eyes and threaten to spill over ."
"i had such high hopes for tonight , such high hopes for him ."
"and he ended up being so gross ."
"i pull my phone out of my wristlet and shoot off a quick text to cara : hey , just got a terrible headache ."
"headed back to my dorm ."
"see you later !"
"i head back across campus and to the safety of my dorm room ."
"my phone buzzes and i pull it back out to see her response : feel better !"
"i envy cara ."
"everything seems to come so easy to her ."
"she can fit in anywhere , make friends with anyone ."
"i guess i 'm just not that kind of person , much as i 'd like to be ."
"chapter three the words are a blur on the page in front of me ."
"i rub my eyes ."
"i did n't sleep well last night , and now i ca n't concentrate on my notes ."
"we have a few days off at the beginning of the week to study , and then final exams ."
"i ca n't let myself slip just because i got a lawn room , but the events of last night are distracting me and studying right now is nearly impossible ."
"my phone rings on the desk next to me ."
"`` hey , mom ! ''"
"i say as i pick up ."
"`` hey , honey !"
"i just saw you called me a bunch yesterday !"
"i 'm sorry ."
"i was out with pierce . ''"
"her melodic voice sounds a little breathless , as it always does when she talks about this new boyfriend ."
"`` well , i have some good news . ''"
"`` me , too ! ''"
"she replies ."
"`` oh !"
"um , do you want to go first ? ''"
"`` actually , i 'm going to be in town tonight ."
"pierce and i were hoping to have dinner with you . ''"
"`` you 're in town ?"
"!"
"that 's great news . ''"
"she laughs ."
"`` no , that 's not the news !"
"do you want to wait to tell me your news until then ? ''"
"`` um , sure ."
"why not ?"
"everything 's ok , though , right ? ''"
"`` everything 's great !"
"we have a reservation for 7 o'clock at decanter ."
"should we pick you up ? ''"
"`` no , that 's ok ."
"it 's just a short walk from campus . ''"
"`` wonderful !"
"oh , i 'm so excited to see you ! ''"
"she says ."
"`` me too ! ''"
"i shut my phone feeling dumbfounded ."
"now i 'm really not going to be able to study ."
"my mom 's never surprised me like this before ."
"i frown ."
"could she and pierce be engaged , and she wants to tell me in person ?"
"i guess i 'd be happy for her , but i 've never met this guy before ."
"what if he 's just one more jerk in the long line of lowlifes that she seems to attract ?"
"my mom is so gorgeous and always loved the attention her looks brought her , but her vanity has always worried me ."
"men are so willing to do everything for her , but they never seem to be the right kind of men ."
"regardless of their character , she 's always had a constant stream of admirers , and has never had to do anything for herself ."
"she does n't know who she is or how to be alone ."
"when i came along , my dad showed his true colors and abandoned us , and she had no skills to fall back on as a twenty-two year-old single mother ."
"i always promised myself that i would n't let myself depend on a man like her ."
"i had to make sure i could make my own way in the world , which is probably why i 've had my nose in a book my whole life ."
"after several more hours of fruitless study , i decide to get ready a little early so that i can take a walk around campus before i meet my mom and her new boyfriend ."
"i put on a cotton summer dress and grab a cardigan in case the restaurant is chilly ."
"i start to feel a little calmer when i reach the lawn and see the rotunda 's white dome in front of me ."
"the architecture always inspires me , and next year i 'll actually be living here ."
"i stand in front of the women 's side of the lawn-genders are separated-and wonder which room will be mine ."
"my mind drifts back unbidden to last night ."
"i so hoped to be able to expand my horizons a little ."
"as wonderful as i know getting a lawn room is , it 's not everything ."
"the way nate 's body looked in the low light from the hall ... the small tuft of hair that showed just above his boxers ... the way he looked at me ."
"i realize i 'm tugging at my braid absent-mindedly , and shake my head at myself-i need to get it together ."
"it 's time to meet my mom and her new boyfriend , and hear their big news ."
"i glance around as i enter decanter ."
"its architecture is modern and elegant , a mix of cream fabrics and dark wood ."
"i 've never been here before-way out of my price range ."
"i 'm about to approach the hostess when i recognize my mom in a prime booth in the corner ."
"i walk toward her between a row of tables , hearing the hushed tones of conversation and the clinking of wine glasses around me ."
"her eyes light up and she stands as she sees me approaching ."
"she looks even more gorgeous than usual ."
"her blonde hair , a little lighter than mine , hangs in a long bob almost to her shoulders , and her perfect teeth show brightly behind her deep red lipstick ."
"`` brynn !"
"i 've missed you , honey , '' she says , enveloping me in a hug ."
"`` you look gorgeous ."
"is n't this dress a little big for you , though ? ''"
"she asks , pulling at the extra fabric ."
"`` you know i like this kind of fit , '' i reply , allowing only the slightest bit of impatience to enter my voice ."
"this is a recurring conversation with us ."
"she always wants me to dress a little more feminine , a little more `` form-flattering '' as she puts it ."
"`` well , i 'm so excited for you to meet pierce ."
"he 's just in the restroom-oh !"
"here he is . ''"
"i follow her gaze to an elegantly dressed man with salt-and-pepper hair and blue eyes who 's approaching us with a warm smile ."
"`` holly , i 'd think this was your sister if i did n't know any better , '' he says , and my mom giggles ."
"`` brynn , i 'm pierce ."
"your mom has told me such wonderful things about you , '' he says as we shake hands ."
"`` likewise , '' i reply politely , though the truth is that she 's told me almost nothing ."
"`` well , let 's sit ."
"i ordered us some champagne for the table ."
"it should be arriving soon . ''"
"we all obediently sit , me on one side of the cushy leather booth , and my mom and pierce on the other ."
"`` so , brynn , you 're in your junior year ? ''"
"`` yes , that's- '' i break off as my mom reaches for her water glass and i spot a ring on her left hand ."
"not an engagement ring , either ."
"a wedding ring ."
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"i ask sharply ."
"`` oh , '' my mom flutters ."
"`` well , we were going to wait until my son arrived , but- '' `` we 're married ! ''"
"my mom announces suddenly ."
"my jaw drops open ."
"`` married ? ''"
"i squeak ."
"`` i mean , i thought maybe you 'd be engaged but married ? ''"
"`` you 're upset ? ''"
"my mom asks worriedly ."
"`` no , not upset ... '' i struggle to put my emotions into the right words ."
"i always feel the need to protect my mom from what i 'm really feeling ."
"she 's always been more fragile than me ."
"`` just surprised , that 's all ."
"i mean , how long have you known each other ? ''"
"`` well , we met six months ago , '' my mom says ."
"`` and then pierce took me on a surprise trip to the turks and caicos last week , and everything was just so perfect ... '' she trails off , looking to him for support ."
"`` it really was , brynn ."
"and it felt so right ."
"we wished you guys could have been there , but we just felt that we had to seize the moment ."
"it was in this little gazebo on the cliff , with spectacular views of the water , and the captain of a boat that was docked at the resort officiated ... '' `` it was engagement , honeymoon , and wedding in one !"
"we just wished you and nate could have been there ."
"that would have made it even more perfect . ''"
"i struggle to catch up with all the information they 're throwing at me ."
"`` sorry , who 's nate ? ''"
"`` oh , nate 's my son ."
"he goes to school here , too ."
"i tried to get a hold of him so we could tell you together , but-wait !"
"there he is ! ''"
"pierce slides out of the booth to wave to his son ."
"nate ."
"not nate ... `` what 's pierce 's last name ? ''"
"i whisper urgently to my mom ."
"`` thornhill , '' she whispers back distractedly , sliding over to stand next to pierce ."
"oh my god ."
"nate thornhill is here ."
"nate thornhill is currently walking up behind me ."
"nate thornhill is my new ... stepbrother , i realize in horror ."
"beads of sweat form at my hairline and i 've suddenly lost my appetite ."
"chapter four as nate walks into my periphery , i watch in slow motion as he hugs his dad and shakes hands with my mom ."
"i can not believe this is happening ."
"surely i 'm in the middle of some strange nightmare and will wake up soon ."
"i hoped i 'd never have to see him again after last night ."
"`` brynn , honey , this is nate , pierce 's son , '' my mom says , cutting through the fog of emotion in my brain ."
"`` h-hi ."
"nate ."
"brynn ."
"i 'm brynn , '' i stammer as he glances over at me ."
"`` brynn , pleasure to meet you , '' he replies formally ."
"wait , does he not even remember meeting me last night ?"
"`` well , scooch over brynn , so nate can sit , '' mom says , waving me over with her hands ."
"`` right , sorry , '' i say , sliding over so that he can sit next to me ."
"i stare straight ahead as he sits ."
"i can feel my body betraying me already ."
"the heat from his leg under the table is giving me heart palpitations ."
"`` thought you were n't going to be able to make it , '' pierce says a little tensely to his son ."
"`` sorry , i was in the library studying ."
"i had my phone off . ''"
"`` well , you missed the big announcement ."
"we were just telling brynn that holly and i have gotten married . ''"
"i glance at nate out of the corner of my eye ."
"i see his eyes widen in surprise ."
"`` married ?"
"i thought you said you 'd never get married again . ''"
"`` well , things change ."
"when i met holly , i just knew ."
"you 'll see when you get to know her ."
"she 's a special woman . ''"
"i watch my mom glow like a 1000 watt bulb and ca n't help but smile ."
"it 's been a while since i 've seen her so happy ."
"`` yeah , i 'm ... i 'm just ... '' i watch him struggle for words just like i did ."
"`` surprised ."
"but happy ."
"i 'm looking forward to getting to know you better , holly . ''"
"wow , that was ... kind ."
"not what the guy i met last night would say ."
"`` oh , me too , nate , '' my mom replies , looking overjoyed ."
"`` and i 'm so excited for you and brynn to get to know each other ! ''"
"`` two only children ... '' pierce says meaningfully ."
"`` you 'll have to learn to share . ''"
"my mom laughs and i join in weakly ."
"`` you always wanted a sibling , brynn !"
"and now you have one !"
"well , a step-sibling , but still . ''"
"a step-sibling that i 've had literally dozens of dirty dreams about ."
"perfect ."
"`` so , you two have never met , then ? ''"
"my mom asks , glancing between us ."
"`` pierce and i were so excited when we realized both our kids were juniors here . ''"
"`` uva is my alma mater , '' pierce adds proudly ."
"`` no , we 've never met , '' i break in quickly ."
"i see nate eye me for a second before he nods ."
"`` nope , never met , unfortunately , '' he says ."
"`` we thought it best not to tell you guys about us until we knew it would really be forever ."
"i thought it would have just been so awkward for you two if we 'd broken up and then you have to keep seeing each other around campus , '' my mom explains ."
"`` yes , that would have been awkward , '' nate says drily , and i know he 's thinking that nothing could compare to my own awkwardness last night ."
"the waitress comes over with the bottle of champagne that pierce ordered ."
"dom perignon , i see as i look at the label ."
"whoa , he must be loaded ."
"my new stepdad must be loaded ."
"she expertly pops the cork and pours us each an elegant flute , placing the bottle into a wine cooler next to the table ."
"pierce takes his glass and raises it ."
"`` to a new family , '' he says , looking around the table ."
"we all raise our glasses and clink them together ."
"i manage to do so without making eye contact with nate ."
"the champagne tickles my throat on the way down ."
"i 've never wanted to drink a bottle of alcohol more in my entire life than at this moment , but i keep myself to a modest sip ."
"`` so , honey , you told me you had some news , too ? ''"
"my mom asks , as she puts down her glass ."
"`` oh , yes , though i do n't think i can follow that announcement , '' i hedge with a smile ."
"`` please !"
"you sounded excited on the phone , '' she encourages me ."
"`` well , i got a lawn room , '' i reveal ."
"my mom gasps in excitement , but i see pierce glance quickly at his son ."
"`` i thought you said that they had n't announced it yet , '' he says quietly ."
"`` i ... i knew you 'd be disappointed ."
"i was waitlisted ."
"it was difficult , juggling two varsity sports , a double major- '' nate replies ."
"i glance at my mom and then between the two men ."
"nate is looking down at the tablecloth ."
"`` i was selected for a lawn room , too , '' pierce says , interrupting him and turning to me ."
"`` it 's an important accomplishment . ''"
"`` thank you ... '' i say hesitantly ."
"nate looks so miserable ."
"`` being waitlisted is impressive , too . ''"
"he glances up at me sharply , his eyes flashing ."
"shit ."
"i heard it , too : pity ."
"`` well , congratulations , both of you , '' my mom breaks in ."
"`` i have no idea what i 'm going to order !"
"everything looks so wonderful . ''"
"she runs her finger down the menu in front of her ."
"having grown up in a family of irish immigrants , my mom has always avoided conflict like the plague , though this time i 'm glad for the change of subject ."
"i decide to order the steak since money does n't seem to be an issue , and we each order a cocktail in addition to the champagne ."
"something begins to tug at the back of my brain after the waitress leaves to put in our food orders ."
"`` pierce , i 'm sorry if this is an ignorant question , but were you in office ?"
"your name sounds so familiar . ''"
"`` yes , '' he replies , looking pleased ."
"`` i 'm a former congressman- '' `` -for virginia ."
"now i remember ."
"you helped pass the campaign finance reforms . ''"
"i smile ."
"`` good memory . ''"
"`` one of my majors is political science , so i try to keep up with it . ''"
"`` and your other major ? ''"
"`` global health . ''"
"`` you know , i run thornhill and co ."
"consulting of k street , and we 're still looking for a summer intern ."
"interested ? ''"
"`` dad , i thought you were going- '' nate breaks in before i can respond ."
"`` and i thought you were going to get a lawn room , '' his dad replies , keeping his voice light ."
"`` so , brynn , what do you think ? ''"
"`` well , um , i was just going to get a summer job back in maryland to help pay for tuition , '' i murmur ."
"did pierce promise his son the internship ?"
"i do n't want to start off this relationship with nate on the wrong foot ."
"`` you do n't need to worry about tuition now , honey , '' my mom says softly ."
"i look at her in surprise ."
"oh my god-is pierce going to pay for my college bills ?"
"the thought had n't even occurred to me ."
"i look between them as they stare back at me calmly ."
"`` oh , oh , i did n't think-i mean , i 'd love to , but i just-if nate wants the- '' `` then it 's settled , '' pierce cuts in ."
"`` i tend to go into the office quite early , but we have an extra car you can use . ''"
"`` sorry ?"
"i do n't understand . ''"
"`` well , pierce and i are moving in together ."
"i mean , i basically live there now , but i 'm officially selling the old house , now that we 're married . ''"
"`` right ."
"of course . ''"
"my brain scrambles to process all the new information ."
"just as i 'm working it all out , i feel a hand on my knee ."
"i look down in surprise to see nate 's arm disappearing under the tablecloth ."
"i glance at him ."
"he 's looking straight ahead as though nothing 's happening ."
"i struggle to maintain my composure as heat travels from his hand and all the way up to ... `` so , this summer , i 'll be living with you then ?"
"all of you ? ''"
"nate turns to smile at me politely ."
"his hand moves another inch up the bare skin of my thigh ."
"i widen my eyes at him but he does n't react ."
"`` that 's right ."
"we 'll all be living at pierce 's house- '' `` our house , '' pierce corrects my mom with a smile ."
"`` our house , in potomac ."
"it 's got tons of space , beautiful views of the river ."
"it 'll be wonderful to have the summer to bond with each other , and really become a family . ''"
"nate 's hand moves another inch up my leg ."
"i can feel the rough , calloused skin of his palm ."
"i 've never been so turned on in my life , but i 'm struggling against it ."
"what is he thinking ?"
"we 're at dinner with our parents !"
"`` i know you have some stuff at the old house , but we 'll have it moved to the new one ."
"everything will be all set up when you get home , '' my mom says , smiling at me ."
"`` mmm , '' i reply , trying to focus on her words ."
"`` i was n't that attached to the old place anyway , '' i add with a shrug ."
"we 'd moved a couple times after my dad left , so no one place has ever felt like home ."
"nate 's hand moves another inch up my thigh , pushing up the hem of my dress so his fingers rest under it ."
"my whole body is tingling ."
"holy hell , i can barely breathe ."
"i 'm shocked pierce and my mom do n't seem to notice that anything 's happening ."
"with his other hand , nate takes a calm sip from his champagne flute ."
"where 's the waitress ?"
"he 'll have to move his hand when the food comes ."
"he moves his hand up another inch ."
"i ca n't take it any longer-another second and i 'm going to start moaning ."
"as my mom moves her head to pierce 's ear to murmur sweet nothings , i slide my fork off the table and press it tongs-first into the top of nate 's hand ."
"i hear him make a sharp intake of breath and then his mouth twitches as he tries to hold position through the pain ."
"i press down harder ."
"suddenly he yanks his hand away and i just manage to stop my hand in time so the fork does n't hit my leg ."
"he turns to me and smiles , a wicked glimmer in his eyes ."
"he was fucking with me , i realize ."
"that 's his way of taking revenge for me showing him up in front of his dad ?"
"what a goddamn creep !"
"i lean toward him with a fake smile plastered on my face ."
"`` if you 're that pissed about it , bring it up with your dad , do n't take it out on me ."
"i did try to turn it down . ''"
"i hiss into his ear ."
"he turns to me with an equally fake smile ."
"`` i 'll do whatever the hell i like , sis . ''"
"he says quietly so our parents ca n't hear ."
"the rest of the meal passes without nate making another fake pass at me ."
"the gears in my brain begin to move as i think about how i 'm going to be spending the entire summer , and potentially many other seasons , living with this guy ."
"my life has been completely upended tonight , and i need some time to process everything ."
"after the waitress clears our coffee cups and pierce takes care of the bill with a black amex card , we stand up to say goodbye ."
"they 're going to drive back to maryland tonight since it takes under three hours ."
"i hug pierce goodbye , then my mom ."
"`` i know this was a lot to take in , honey ."
"we 'll talk everything over , i promise , '' she whispers reassuringly , then kisses me on the cheek ."
"i smile at her and begin to tear up-i 'm pretty overwhelmed ."
"nate surprises me by leaning in for a hug as our parents look on with a smile ."
"`` great to meet you , '' he says , then whispers almost silently in my ear , `` sorry , we 'll never get a chance to have that threesome , sis . ''"
"i freeze as he pats my back once and then breaks away ."
"he remembered ."
"and now he will always know how attracted i am to him ."
"i have a feeling i 'm never going to hear the end of it ."
"chapter five `` i do n't mean to question the relationship , it was just so sudden , '' i explain to my mom as she drives me home from the airport ."
"i usually never fly to or from college , but pierce insisted ."
"my biggest worry was that nate and i might be on the same flight , but luckily his exams ended earlier than mine ."
"i want as much time as possible to prepare myself for our interactions ."
"`` no , i get it , i really do , '' my mom assures me ."
"`` you can ask me anything about pierce , or me and pierce , and i wo n't be upset . ''"
"`` he treats you well ? ''"
"`` he 's wonderful ."
"he 's always surprising me with little gifts , trips , even ."
"i do n't know what i 've done to deserve him . ''"
"`` well , i think you 're pretty great . ''"
"i offer dramatically ."
"`` oh , i did n't mean it like that !"
"i just mean , pierce treats me like a princess ."
"and the house is basically a castle , '' she adds , pointing to her right ."
"i gasp at the flagstone mansion we 're pulling alongside ."
"`` shut up ."
"that 's his house !"
"?"
"it 's huge ! ''"
"`` i know , right ? ''"
"my mom replies with a laugh ."
"`` it has maid 's quarters !"
"but you 'll get used to it , really . ''"
"`` there 's a maid ? ''"
"`` he used to have a housekeeper/maid who would cook for him , but now i do most of that stuff ."
"i love having someone else to cook for again ."
"the maid just comes once a week now to do a really thorough cleaning , '' she explains as we pull through the wrought-iron gates leading the driveway ."
"`` are you still working at the salon ? ''"
"she used to support herself as a manicurist at the tiny salon back in our small town in eastern maryland ."
"`` nope , not anymore ."
"i 'm volunteering , though , and thinking of joining some charitable boards , '' she says nonchalantly ."
"my mom , a lady who lunches , i think , shaking my head ."
"i do n't know if i can see it ."
"my mom presses a button on the car 's dashboard and one of the two garage doors opens ."
"we pull inside and i look around at the huge space as the door closes behind us ."
"if i 'm this in shock about the size of the garage , i ca n't imagine how i 'll feel about the rest of the place ."
"after the tour , which took over an hour because the house is so massive , my mom finally leads me to my room ."
"my head is swimming at the lavishness of my new home ."
"as we walk down the plushly carpeted hallway , i 'm alarmed to realize that i can actually smell nate ."
"he must be nearby somewhere ."
"i 've been dreading seeing him again and hoped i 'd have more time to settle in before our first confrontation ."
"`` here 's nate 's room , '' my mom says as we pass a partially open door ."
"`` he 's out somewhere right now . ''"
"i shake my head at myself ."
"i wish i could turn off the part of my body that 's attracted to him ."
"if anything , though , my sex dreams about him have only become more frequent and more alarming ever since he laid his hand on my thigh ."
"`` and here 's your room . ''"
"i ca n't believe it 's right next door to nate 's room ."
"there are so many rooms in this place-i would have preferred to have a bit more separation between us ."
"`` whoa , '' i say as she pushes the door open , and my misgivings about the room are forgotten ."
"a canopy with a delicate white fabric settled on it hangs over the four-poster bed in the center of the room ."
"a matching nightstand , bureau , and vanity make up the rest of the furniture ."
"the wallpaper is a tasteful , blue and white pattern with small birds on it that complements the light , airy feel of the room ."
"i release the handle of my luggage and head over the to the window seat and kneel on it ."
"there 's a spectacular view of the potomac river below-the house was clearly built to play up the amazing location ."
"i glance to my left ."
"`` is that my own bathroom ? ''"
"`` yup-no more sharing ! ''"
"my mom replies gaily ."
"i step inside and admire the all-white tile and huge tub ."
"i 've never been in a house so nice ."
"i ca n't believe i 'm actually going to call this place home from now on ."
"`` you want anything to eat ? ''"
"my mom asks from the bedroom ."
"`` um , yeah , that would be great , '' i call over my shoulder ."
"`` ok , i 'll whip something up ."
"you stay here and get settled ."
"i 'll be in the kitchen when you 're ready to eat . ''"
"i wander back into the bedroom as my mom disappears down the stairs ."
"there is one question i have that i ca n't bring myself to ask her ."
"it 's just ... i know my mom worries about money , about me graduating from school with so much debt ."
"it 's not that i think she would have married pierce just for the money , but i worry that it might have clouded her judgment a bit ."
"they got married so quickly-can she really know him that well ?"
"maybe i 'm just falling back into my usual pattern of co-dependency and mothering her ."
"she 's a grown woman , i ca n't control what she does and i 'm not responsible for her decisions ... not to mention , i am hugely relieved to not have to carry around student loans for the rest of my life ."
"i kick my sandals off and sink back down onto the window seat ."
"the potomac is a dark green sliver barely visible through the bushy trees that line the back of the estate and continue down to the shoreline ."
"i startle as a figure breaks the stillness ."
"i recognize nate 's head as he walks up from the lower lawn to the pool , a lacrosse stick tucked over his shoulder ."
"sheesh-is he training already ?"
"school just ended !"
"i bite my lip as i watch him toss the stick on the deck and peel off his shirt ."
"he uses it to wipe the sweat off his face , then tosses it on a chair and kicks off his sneakers ."
"his body is just ... impossible ."
"i mean , i guess it makes sense ."
"two varsity sports are probably enough to give anyone a body like a greek god , but he also has the face to match ."
"he jumps in the pool and i watch him swim a lap , the cool blue water cascading over his muscular back and shoulders ."
"i need to get used to seeing him like this-and stop acting like a total freak every time we 're in the same room ."
"this is my new normal ."
"`` your food 's ready ! ''"
"my mom calls upstairs , her voice echoing a bit in the multi-level foyer ."
"i jump up and head downstairs ."
"i turn into a formal dining room before finding my way to the kitchen ."
"i stop as i realize the kitchen windows look directly out onto the pool ."
"great ."
"`` i ca n't believe nate 's already in the pool ."
"the water 's still freezing , '' my mom comments ."
"`` yeah , he 's crazy ... '' i reply , before i really hear what she said ."
"i 'm too distracted by nate 's backstroke , his arms cutting cleanly through the water ."
"`` so you two never once ran into each other on campus in the three years you 've been at uva ? ''"
"she asks , sliding a blt onto the glass table in the breakfast nook ."
"we sit down across from each other and i start eating ."
"`` no , well ... we had n't ever met . ''"
"`` but ? ''"
"my mom digs , hearing a slight hesitation in my voice ."
"`` well , nate 's really well known around campus ."
"he starts on the lacrosse and crew teams , he 's smart , good- '' i catch myself and pretend to clear my throat ."
"`` good-looking ? ''"
"my mom asks with a smile ."
"`` mom ... '' i groan ."
"`` well , he is ."
"i 'm not blind ."
"actually , pierce looked just like him when he was his age . ''"
"i see nate get out of the pool over my mom 's shoulder and shake himself off ."
"i force myself to look down at my sandwich as he walks across to a lawn chair and lies down ."
"`` what happened to nate 's mom ? ''"
"my mom winces ."
"`` pierce does n't really like to talk about it-too painful ."
"apparently , she cheated on him and then abandoned him and nate ."
"they never see her . ''"
"`` oh , that 's awful , '' i murmur , trying to shove down the twinge of pity i feel for my new stepbrother ."
"`` i think it 's one of the things that brought us together-raising a child by ourselves . ''"
"my eyes flick to the door as nate slides it open ."
"he 's put his shirt back on but it clings to his still damp torso , emphasizing his muscular pecs and shoulders ."
"he drops his sneakers on the mat as he shuts the door behind him ."
"`` hey nate , '' my mom greets him ."
"`` would you like a sandwich ? ''"
"`` you do n't have to do that , '' he says , a little gruffly ."
"`` i do n't mind at all , '' she replies , standing to move back to the counter ."
"he pauses , then sits in her abandoned chair a bit reluctantly ."
"`` it 's so funny that you and brynn never met at school ! ''"
"`` i think there might have been one time- '' he says , glancing at me , that same devilish look back in his eyes ."
"i feel his knee come to rest against mine under the table , and i quickly cross my legs ."
"`` in class ."
"we have been in a few of the same classes together , '' i clarify , narrowing my eyes at him ."
"`` we have ? ''"
"he asks looking genuinely surprised ."
"my mom quietly spreads mayo on a slice of bread at the marble island ."
"`` yes , '' i whisper , embarrassed ."
"of course he would n't remember all of the times we 've sat in the same classroom-only the time when i ogled him in the doorway of his bedroom and completely embarrassed myself ."
"i blush ."
"i want to sink into this seat cushion and disappear ."
"he frowns at me then turns his palm over and begins to pick at a callous ."
"`` so honey , pierce says you 'll start your internship on monday , ok ?"
"that 'll give you a few days to settle in , '' my mom says as she slides the sandwich in front of nate ."
"`` sounds good , '' i reply , glancing at nate out of the corner of my eye ."
"`` i 'm having someone over for dinner tomorrow night , '' he announces rather abruptly ."
"`` oh , wonderful ."
"a friend from around here ? ''"
"`` not a friend , really ."
"a girl i dated in high school , '' nate clarifies ."
"i keep my eyes trained carefully forward ."
"`` do you know if she has any dietary restrictions ? ''"
"my mom asks , excitedly flying into hostess mode ."
"`` i could make this chicken dish my mom passed down , or ... '' i tune out as she offers more ideas , and polish off my sandwich as quickly as possible so i can excuse myself and go upstairs ."
"i sigh as i close my bedroom door behind me ."
"so now i have to have dinner with nate 's ex-girlfriend ."
"is this what the rest of the summer is going to be like ?"
"nate punishing me for his father 's favor by exploiting my attraction to him ?"
"i 'd rather be back in the library , buried in a book ."
"chapter six i push the sauteed chicken around my plate as i try not to watch nate drape his arm around the back of dana 's chair ."
"she 's pretty ."
"very pretty ."
"and sweet ."
"i wish she were n't so sweet so i could hate her for a good reason ."
"`` so how long did you two date ? ''"
"my mom asks ."
"`` well , it was on and off , so ... hard to say ."
"he actually went to prom with one of my friends , '' she replies , jokingly nudging nate , who at least has the grace to blush ."
"`` nate ... '' his dad says , shaking his head admonishingly ."
"`` oh , it 's ok ."
"i went with one of his friends , '' dana says with a smile ."
"`` i think we both knew it was n't meant to be . ''"
"`` a couple of my friends met their husbands in high school , '' my mom says , resting her fork on her plate ."
"`` though i read an article recently that said that twenty-eight percent of women meet their husbands in college . ''"
"she looks pointedly at me and i jump up ."
"`` i 'll clear , '' i announce ."
"i have a feeling i know where this conversation is headed and i want to avoid it ."
"`` oh , thank you , brynn , '' pierce says , as i stack the plates on top of one another ."
"`` no problem , '' i reply ."
"`` i waited tables in high school . ''"
"`` same , '' nate says , as i reach in front of him to take his plate ."
"`` you did not , '' i retort , before i can think ."
"he looks up at me and raises his eyebrows , his gaze unreadable beneath them ."
"pierce laughs ."
"`` it 's true . ''"
"`` my dad says working is the only way to build character , '' nate reports quietly ."
"`` oh , '' i say , blushing as i push my way through the swinging door into the kitchen ."
"i place the china carefully next to the sink and lean onto the counter ."
"god , i feel like i ca n't say anything right around nate ."
"my mind freezes up while my body is set on fire ."
"`` so , are you dating anyone at school , brynn ? ''"
"pierce asks ."
"damn him ."
"`` not right now , '' i reply , sitting back down ."
"`` who were you dating ?"
"maybe i know him , '' nate says , his dark eyes picking up the candlelight in the table 's elaborate centerpiece ."
"my mom spent all afternoon on it ."
"`` probably not , '' i say evasively , pasting a polite smile on my face ."
"he really knows how to get under my skin ."
"the truth is , i 've never really dated anyone , much as my mom pushes me , and as much as i 'm embarrassed by the fact ."
"`` who wants dessert ? ''"
"i manage to sidestep any more questioning by bringing out the last course , though now i 'm starting to think about the fact that nate and dana are probably going to want to go off somewhere after this and have sex ."
"i hope it 's not in nate 's room ."
"what if i can hear them through the wall ?"
"my mom insists on clearing the dessert plates , and nate and dana stand up ."
"pierce and nate start talking quietly , and dana comes over to me ."
"`` you are so gorgeous . ''"
"she offers ."
"`` i have to ask : what do you use on your skin ? ''"
"`` i-what ?"
"um , soap ? ''"
"oh man , she really makes it difficult to hate her ."
"`` soap ?"
"just ... soap ?"
"oh my god , i have this whole routine , '' she says , laughing at herself ."
"`` well , thanks ."
"i guess i 'll be seeing you around often ? ''"
"i ask , but she looks surprised ."
"`` because you and nate are dating . ''"
"`` we 're not really dating , '' she confides to me ."
"`` he 's not the type , and i gave up hope years ago ."
"but just look at him-can you blame me for coming back ? ''"
"she says with a grin , then her eyes widen ."
"`` oh my gosh-sorry !"
"i forgot for a second that he 's your brother ! ''"
"`` step-brother , '' i correct her ."
"`` well , i 'm gon na head upstairs ."
"it was really nice to meet you , dana . ''"
"`` you , too , '' she replies , stepping away to join pierce and nate 's conversation ."
"i head into the foyer but at the last second decide not to go upstairs ."
"i need some air ."
"i find myself heading down the hallway and to the french doors in the wood-paneled study ."
"they open onto the patio and i step outside with relief , closing the door behind me ."
"the firm breeze from the river calls me forward and i head down toward it ."
"i circle around the swimming pool on the first level of the backyard , and then down to a grassy lawn with a lacrosse goal set up on one end ."
"the wooden stairs down to the rocky beach are set on the right side , and it takes me a minute to find them in the dark ."
"as i head down the steps , i see the potomac spread out in front of me ."
"the water rushes hungrily by , lit only by the sparsely set houses on the cliffs surrounding it ."
"as i step onto the shore , i can feel the rocks pressing up through my sandals , and boulders casting long , dark shadows on either side of me ."
"this is no white-sand beach ."
"the river runs dangerously fast after rains , and there are even white-water rapids along parts of it ."
"i look back at the steps behind me and then back out at the river ."
"i feel so out of place here ."
"even though our old house did n't really feel like home either , i wish i were there now , stretched out on the ratty old couch , with my mom in her chair , watching something on our small tv ."
"i do n't know if i 'll ever be able to feel like i belong here ."
"i 'll always feel like a guest in pierce 's house ."
"i walk down closer to the water until i can feel the pebbles getting smaller underneath my feet ."
"i do n't want my shoes to get wet ."
"i jump as a bird breaks out of a tree above me ."
"i can just see it as it flies off , its body a moving ink blot against the dark sky ."
"i wish i could follow it ."
"i turn and walk back toward the steps , feeling as lonely as i 've ever felt ."
"i shake my head at myself as i climb the wooden stairs ."
"my mom is happy , and i 'm fortunate to live in a place like this ."
"stop feeling sorry for yourself , brynn ."
"as i walk across the lower lawn , i look up and see my mom and pierce 's bedroom light go off ."
"i guess they 're turning in early tonight ."
"i walk up toward the pool and freeze as i hear a moan ."
"the lights downstairs are all off except one in the hall , and the pool 's lights underneath the water ."
"my eyes dart around and fall on two writhing bodies on a poolside lounge chair ."
"nate and dana ."
"i stare as nate whips off his own shirt and then dana 's ."
"i know i should move but i do n't ."
"the blue pool lights shimmer against his back muscles as he expertly undoes dana 's bra and pulls off her pants and underwear ."
"leave , you pervert !"
"my brain commands me , but my body stays firmly glued in place , even as it throbs with desire ."
"one of nate 's hands massages dana 's ample breasts , and the other disappears beneath her ."
"dana cries out immediately and i almost gasp myself , as though his hands are moving against me ."
"i can practically feel his touch on me , his hot breath against my ear as his expert fingers move inside me ... nate grunts and pushes against her ."
"she struggles to contain herself as he thrusts slowly in and out of her ."
"oh my god-what am i doing !"
"?"
"i step back with a jolt as though i 'm breaking out of a trance and almost trip over the hydrangea bush next to me in my hurry to get away ."
"i run as quickly and quietly as i can around the side of the house and to the front ."
"i reach the front door and pray that nate is going to lock up later ."
"i feel the doorknob turn and push the door open in relief ."
"i hurry up the curving staircase and down the hall into my room , kicking off my sandals before hurling myself onto my bed and burying my head in the pillows ."
"i can feel my cheeks burning with mortification over what i just witnessed and the uncontrollable desire i felt ."
"i 've had crushes before , but none like my obsession with nate ."
"and even after finally meeting him , only to have him tease me and push my buttons , i still feel so physically drawn to him ."
"i pull my face out of the pillow and crawl to the nightstand , pulling my dog-eared copy of lady chatterley 's lover out of the top drawer ."
"just as i 'm opening it to the folded-over page , there 's a quiet knock at my door ."
"i toss my book on the bed and walk to it , hoping and praying it 's not nate ."
"i almost jump as i pull open the door and nate 's face appears , shrouded in the darkness of the hallway ."
"he leans forward , leaning his forearm on the doorjamb as i step back nervously ."
"his wavy hair looks particularly unruly , and his lips are curved in a slight smile ."
"`` technically speaking , does a peeping tom have to be outside , looking inside ?"
"or does the term still apply if both , or all three , parties are outdoors ? ''"
"he asks , calmly , tilting his chin up slightly as he considers me ."
"`` i ... i do n't ... '' i stammer , feeling heat crawl up the back of my neck ."
"`` you ."
"were ."
"watching us , '' he accuses me , narrowing his eyes ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i did n't mean to ."
"i just ... i was down at the river ... how did you ... ? ''"
"`` i heard a twig snap and saw you running away like a drunken ostrich . ''"
"`` did dana- ? ''"
"`` no , and i did n't tell her . ''"
"`` thank god . ''"
"`` so ?"
"what did you think ? ''"
"he smirks ."
"`` oh , i 'm so sorry , again ."
"i 'm so embarrassed , '' i rush on ."
"it strikes me that this is the longest conversation i 've ever had with my new stepbrother ."
"and it 's about how i 'm a pervert ."
"fantastic ."
"`` why were you watching us ? ''"
"he asks , stepping forward into my room ."
"i take another step away from him ."
"`` um , i ... i do n't know ."
"it just sort of happened ."
"i did n't mean to . ''"
"`` liar , '' he comments lightly ."
"`` asshole . ''"
"it slips out before i can stop myself ."
"he tilts his head slightly ."
"`` prude , '' he levels at me ."
"i look down ."
"maybe i am a prude , but i do n't want to be ."
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"he asks ."
"when i look back up at him , i see him gazing past me , to my book on the bed ."
"`` nothing , just a book , '' i say , but he 's breezing past me toward it ."
"i hurry after him but he reaches the bed before me and picks up the book ."
"`` see ? ''"
"i say defiantly ."
"`` i know what lady chatterley 's lover is about , '' he says , looking at me with a smug grin ."
"shit ."
"`` maybe not such a prude after all , '' he adds , running his eyes up and down my body ."
"i swallow hard ."
"`` you know what i think ? ''"
"he asks , stepping toward me ."
"i step away again , feeling one of the posts of my bed against my back ."
"`` i think you want me ."
"i think you can barely contain yourself . ''"
"`` that 's mighty arrogant of you , '' i comment ."
"i begin to tug the ends of my hair nervously ."
"`` why are you doing that ? ''"
"he asks , frowning ."
"`` it 's just a nervous habit , '' i say with a shrug , and drop my hand ."
"`` so i make you nervous ? ''"
"`` no , '' i reply quickly ."
"`` just you being in here ... '' `` i 'm only arrogant if i 'm wrong . ''"
"`` wrong about what ? ''"
"i feel the urge to pull my hair again but do n't want to give him the satisfaction ."
"`` wrong about you wanting me ."
"let 's give it a test- '' he narrows his eyebrows , studying me ."
"`` i 'm going to kiss you now , and all you have to do is tell me to stop . ''"
"`` what ?"
"that 's crazy ."
"not to mention you just fucked dana , and now you expect me to kiss you ? ''"
"i protest , but he steps toward me ."
"i try to pull backward but i 'm already pressed against my bedpost ."
"desire unfurls deep in my stomach as his eyes lock onto mine ."
"`` if it 's crazy , just tell me to stop , '' he whispers teasingly , and moves closer ."
"his musky scent fills my nose and my mind begins to swim ."
"i feel wetness trickling down my thigh as he curls his arms around me , grasping the bedpost with both hands behind my lower back ."
"he 's so close to me ."
"i can feel heat radiating off him ."
"his legs and chest sink against me and he moves his lips toward mine ."
"just a few inches between nate thornhill 's mouth and mine ."
"now an inch ."
"now two centimeters ... i can feel his warm breath against my partially open lips ..."
"`` stop . ''"
"i whisper ."
"he freezes but does n't pull away , as though he ca n't believe what he 's just heard ."
"though truthfully , i 'm marveling at my own restraint ."
"i can feel his erection against my thigh-i know he wants me , too ."
"now i can beat him at his own game ."
"i lean forward slightly , allowing my lips to brush against his as i speak , `` unless you do n't want to . ''"
"his eyes , which were focused on my lips , flick back up to meet mine ."
"i force myself to stay steady even as i 'm consumed by the lust in his gaze ."
"he stares at me for a moment , then pushes off the bedpost and steps back ."
"he opens his mouth , about to say something , but nothing comes out ."
"i remain pressed against the bedpost as he turns and moves toward the door ."
"without looking back , he shuts it behind him ."
"i stumble forward and take a deep breath ."
"it 's like he takes all the air out of the room and i ca n't breathe when he 's around ."
"i ca n't believe i just rejected him ."
"i 'm stunned , but i also feel like giving myself a standing ovation ."
"i just resisted the advances of nate thornhill , my fantasy of almost three years ."
"i should win a willpower award ."
"i knew that if i 'd let him kiss me , i would forever lose any kind of power in our relationship ."
"i 'd be just be another pathetic girl who fell for his charms ."
"of course , the downside is that i 'm more turned on than i 've ever been in my life , and i 'm alone with a book again ."
"i sigh and crawl back onto my bed ."
"i have a feeling that whatever is happening between me and my stepbrother , i have n't seen the end of it yet ."
"chapter seven `` i 'm so happy there 's another girl working here ! ''"
"constance says , swiveling around on her desk chair ."
"she 's my new cubicle mate , and one of only a handful of other interns at thornhill and co. `` ah , there ."
"my outlook is finally working , '' i announce , opening the email system on my desktop ."
"`` so they 'll want you to sign an nda and stuff , but after , want to go to lunch ? ''"
"she asks ."
"`` what 's an nda ? ''"
"i turn to face her ."
"`` non-disclosure agreement ."
"there are a ton of senators and big business types who come in here , and you ca n't tell anyone ."
"very important , '' she says in hushed tones ."
"she seems very pleased that she 's snagged this coveted internship , which is probably why i have n't told her that i 'm the boss 's stepdaughter ."
"i 've never benefited from nepotism before , and it feels strange and uncomfortable to me now ."
"`` oh ."
"well i 'd love to get lunch later this week , but i 'm having lunch with my friend allison today ."
"we go to uva together , and she 's got an internship at this urban planning place in georgetown , so i 'm going to meet up with her . ''"
"`` cool ."
"georgetown has really good shopping ."
"i 'd love to go with you sometime ."
"fashion is like , my side hobby , and you have a stylist 's dream body . ''"
"`` i do n't think i- '' i begin my canned response to a shopping invitation before i realize that maybe i can afford it ."
"and constance looks so perfectly chic in her patterned cardigan and statement necklace ."
"`` you know , that would be wonderful ."
"i really do n't know what to buy . ''"
"`` oh , i can help you with that ."
"but careful not to wear anything too tight around mr. thornhill , '' she adds , rolling her eyes ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"i ask with a frown ."
"`` oh my god , who is that ? ''"
"constance asks , breaking away from our conversation to stand and peer over our cubicle wall ."
"i join her to see nate and pierce walking down the hallway together toward the elevator bank ."
"they must be having lunch together ."
"`` that 's his son , '' i reply , immediately sitting down again ."
"`` he looks like a polo model ! ''"
"constance exclaims , sitting back down ."
"`` um , what were you saying about pierce-mr. thornhill-just then ? ''"
"`` well , i 've never had an issue , but maybe he 's just not into asian girls , '' she says , throwing her black hair over her shoulder carelessly ."
"`` from what i 've heard , though , he has a certain reputation . ''"
"`` oh , no , '' i reply , worriedly tugging on my hair ."
"shit ."
"shit ."
"i knew he was too good to be true ."
"`` do n't worry ."
"from what i 've heard , he 's pretty harmless , he 's just from a different generation when it comes to women around the office-especially young women , '' she adds ."
"`` mmhm , '' i reply , my mind already spiraling into crisis mode ."
"`` you ok , brynn ? ''"
"`` maybe he 's changed , though ."
"i mean , he 's married now , '' i say , clinging to a speck of hope ."
"`` yeah , i heard he got married . ''"
"she shrugs ."
"`` could be ."
"i do n't think it 's something that 's been really recent or anything . ''"
"i nod , feeling slightly mollified ."
"we both spin back to our computers as we hear footsteps approaching our cubicle ."
"i glance up to see pierce and nate appear in the opening ."
"`` brynn , this is going to sound awful , '' pierce begins , and i brace myself ."
"`` but nate and i had plans to go to lunch , and we got down to the lobby before i realized how rude it was not to invite you along . ''"
"phew ."
"for a second i thought he overheard our conversation ."
"`` oh , that 's so nice , but i actually have lunch plans with my best friend from school , anyway . ''"
"`` oh i see ... well , enjoy !"
"there are some great restaurants around here ."
"we just wanted to let you know you were invited , '' pierce says kindly , though from nate 's frown i 'm guessing that it was more his idea than his son 's ."
"`` constance , right ? ''"
"he says , turning to her ."
"`` yes , that 's right , '' she squeaks ."
"`` alright , well , we better get going or we 'll be late for our reservation ."
"see you at home ! ''"
"pierce says with a wave , and walks off with nate in tow ."
"huh ."
"i notice that nate did n't say a single word to me ."
"i guess he does n't like being the one left wanting for once ."
"`` why will mr. thornhill see you at home ? ''"
"constance says , slowly turning her desk chair to face me , a weird expression on her face ."
"`` um , well , i 'm his stepdaughter ."
"he just married my mom . ''"
"constance gasps and buries her face in her hands ."
"`` oh my god , oh my god , i 'm so fired ."
"i 'm fired , right ? ''"
"`` what ?"
"no !"
"i do n't have that kind of authority , i 'm just an intern , like you . ''"
"`` you 're the boss 's daughter , and i was just gossiping about him ! ''"
"`` step-daughter , and i get it ."
"if i 'd heard rumors like that , i might want to warn other women i work with , too . ''"
"`` but i do n't even know if they 're true , i 'm so sorry , '' she says miserably ."
"`` really , it 's ok. and i 'm sorry that i did n't tell you earlier that i 'm his stepdaughter ."
"i just ... you know , did n't want it to seem like it was the only reason i got the internship ."
"i mean , i really do work very hard . ''"
"`` of course you do !"
"of course ."
"yes ."
"i should get back to work , '' constance says , turning to her computer and beginning to type rapidly ."
"`` ... and now i 'm worried she 's going to keep acting really weird around me , '' i confide to allison over a caesar salad at clyde 's on m street ."
"`` do you think it 's true ? ''"
"she whispers , leaning over the table between us ."
"`` i do n't know ... i mean , maybe he was just a flirt , and it got blown out of proportion , you know ? ''"
"`` i bet that 's what it is , '' allison says , nodding her head sagely ."
"`` who knows how stories like that really get started ?"
"and once they 're out there , you ca n't erase them . ''"
"`` i hope that 's what it is ... i do n't want to discount some woman 's , or women 's , experience just because it would be inconvenient for me , though , and painful for my mom ."
"she would be so crushed if it were true . ''"
"`` i would n't worry about it ."
"and that girl said they were old stories , right ? ''"
"`` right . ''"
"`` and you said he treats your mom well , so i bet they 're just ugly rumors . ''"
"`` yeah , yeah , '' i reply , pushing the thought of pierce 's alleged misbehavior to the back of my brain ."
"`` how 's the place you 're staying at george washington ? ''"
"i ask , knowing she 's taking advantage of a program at the nearby university to give summer interns a low-cost place to stay in an otherwise expensive city ."
"`` it 's fine ."
"my roommate 's kinda loud , though ."
"how 's your new house ? ''"
"`` it 's so big !"
"i do n't know why anyone would need that much space ."
"i mean before my mom and i got there , it was just for two people ."
"well , three , including the maid . ''"
"`` there 's a maid ?"
"! ''"
"`` there was ."
"she does n't live there anymore ."
"oh , and there 's all this flagstone on it , so i thought it was old , but my mom said that pierce had the house built around fifteen years ago ."
"he must have spent a lot of money to make something so new look worn-in . ''"
"`` you 're lucky , '' allison says ."
"`` i know . ''"
"`` how 's the stepbrother ?"
"i do n't know if i could live with a dumb jock . ''"
"`` well , nate 's not dumb ."
"i 've been in a few classes with him , and he 's really smart ."
"he was even waitlisted for a lawn room . ''"
"`` you 're a little defensive of him , '' allison observes , sipping her water ."
"`` yeah , i guess so ."
"i do n't know why though ."
"he 's been playing these weird mind games with me . ''"
"`` mind games ? ''"
"she repeats , frowning ."
"i push a crouton around my plate as i think about how much to tell her ."
"i have a feeling it 's not the kind of situation she 'd condone , but i also really want to talk to someone about what 's been going on ."
"`` well , you remember that i used to have a crush on him ? ''"
"`` yeah , i remember you saying something about it sophomore year . ''"
"`` i ... i still have a crush on him ."
"or i think i do ... i do n't know ."
"i 'm definitely attracted to him , and he 's aware of the fact ."
"he can be really rude , and then last night , he almost kissed me , but he ... '' `` whoa , what ?"
"i mean , brynn , he 's your stepbrother . ''"
"`` i know !"
"but only for the last few weeks , and- '' `` ok ... but what if you did kiss ?"
"what then ?"
"you 'd have to see him every day , because your mom and his dad are married ."
"and then even if you were n't living together , what about holidays ?"
"you 'd be cutting the thanksgiving turkey and sitting across from the guy you 'd made out with ... for every thanksgiving . ''"
"`` ugh , you 're right , '' i reply , dropping my fork and covering my face with my hands ."
"this is why i did n't want to tell allison-she 'd throw logic in the face of my hormones ."
"but the truth is , she 's right ."
"i feel like a bucket of cold water has just been poured over my head ."
"`` you 're right , '' i repeat ."
"`` i ca n't believe i even let it get this far . ''"
"i head back to the office after lunch and spend the rest of the afternoon sitting in an awkward silence with constance ."
"i try to get her to engage about online shopping , but she only offers me one-word responses ."
"later in the day i meet another intern named greg , a cute , strawberry-blonde guy who blushes when i look him in the eye ."
"he is more the kind of person i should be looking to date ."
"i just wish i felt that same rush that i do whenever i 'm around nate ."
"i drive home just after six in the old audi that was just sitting in the thornhill 's garage ."
"it 's definitely the most expensive car i 've ever driven , and it 's fun to really let out the engine on the short stretch of the beltway on my way back to potomac ."
"i park in the garage and let myself in to the small anteroom off the kitchen , where i kick off my shoes ."
"`` mom ? ''"
"i call out , before spotting her outside on the back lawn , talking on the phone as the sun sets behind her ."
"i head upstairs with my tote bag still over my shoulder ."
"the huge house is silent as i walk up the steps and down the hallway ."
"nate must still be at his internship ."
"my mom told me he got one at some think tank downtown ."
"i drop my bag as i walk into my bedroom and push the door almost closed behind me with my foot ."
"i ca n't wait to get this skirt off ."
"it 's my one pencil skirt , and it 's a little itchy around my waist ."
"i step into the bathroom and turn on the elegant faucet in the sink ."
"i tie my hair behind my head with a loose elastic and splash some cool water on my skin ."
"first days are always exhausting , but i think today was unusually so ."
"as i look back up to my reflection , dripping with water , i see something move in the mirror ."
"i stare at it blankly , not understanding what i 'm seeing ."
"the mirror above the sink is reflecting the mirror above my vanity in the bedroom , which is in turn reflecting an image from my partially open bedroom door ."
"it 's nate , i realize ."
"he 's standing outside my door , and he does n't realize i can see him ."
"i look down at the sink , pretending to watch the last of the water as it swirls down the drain ."
"a shiver of excitement runs through me at the idea that nate could actually be interested in me-i mean , he 's there , right now , watching me ."
"before i process what i 'm doing , before i can think of all the reasons not to , i slowly move my hands to my lower back and undo the clasp at the top of the zipper , then unzip my skirt ."
"i let it fall in a pile at my feet , then step out of it ."
"i look up carefully and nate is still there in the double reflection ."
"allison 's warning echoes through my mind but i keep going ."
"i feel high , high on the feeling that i 'm actually desired ."
"i catch hold of the back of my rather shapeless blouse in my hands and pull it up over my head , then toss it onto the floor ."
"as i look back in the mirror , i try to imagine what someone else might see when they look at me , without my constant negative interior monologue telling me nasty things about myself ."
"do i have the kind of body that someone like nate could find attractive ?"
"now down to my bra and underwear , i begin to feel nervous , but i reach up to unclasp my bra ."
"i feel the straps loosen on my shoulders and bring my hands forward to catch it as it falls ."
"`` brynn ?"
"you home ? ''"
"i hear my mom call from the foyer ."
"i freeze , holding the bra against my breasts ."
"i glance up ."
"nate is gone ."
"`` yup , i 'm home ! ''"
"i yell back ."
"`` i saw your shoes !"
"i 'm coming up-i want to hear all about your first day . ''"
"i hear her footsteps on the staircase and hurriedly refasten my bra ."
"nothing like your mom 's voice to kill your libido ."
"chapter eight the next couple weeks of my new life seem to pass rather quickly , mostly due to the fact that nate is always out with his friends after work , and our run-ins have been few and far between ."
"i 've settled into a routine of sorts , even if i still do n't feel like i 'm at home here ."
"i 'd gone to bed early last night , with the intention of sleeping in this morning before visiting museums with allison later in the day ."
"however a loud noise from downstairs awakens me-i stare bleary eyed at my alarm clock , it 's only 6:15am ."
"who 'd be awake this early on a saturday morning ?"
"i get out of bed and tiptoe to my door ."
"i open it a little and hear something shuffling around downstairs ."
"i tiptoe out into the hallway and see everyone 's bedroom doors are closed ."
"i know there 's an alarm system-i had to memorize the passcode ."
"maybe an ungainly mouse is exploring ?"
"i creep down the staircase and through the dining room ."
"the noises sounded like they were coming from the kitchen ."
"the swinging door is open , and i peak my head around it , my heartbeat blasting in my ears ."
"suddenly , nate steps out in front of me ."
"`` fuck ! ''"
"he exclaims , and i jump back , startled ."
"`` oh , god , i thought you were a burglar . ''"
"`` then you should have called 911 , '' he retorts brusquely , turning his back to me and walking to the island ."
"`` well , you should be glad i did n't . ''"
"sheesh , does he have to find something wrong with everything i say ?"
"`` what are you doing up so early anyway ? ''"
"`` i was just working out . ''"
"`` wow ."
"this early ? ''"
"i ask , moving around him ."
"he 's fiddling with something in front of him ."
"`` yeah , every morning ."
"i need to stay in shape during the off-season . ''"
"`` i 'd be exhausted if- '' i break off , as i see blood dripping from his palms onto the granite countertop ."
"`` oh my god , you 're bleeding ! ''"
"i gasp ."
"`` yeah , i just ca n't get this fucking tape to ... '' he struggles to wind a bandage around his palm ."
"`` let me , '' i say , spying a first aid kit on the counter by the window ."
"from the blood smeared on it , i can see nate 's already gone through it ."
"`` you do n't have to , '' he protests ."
"`` come over here ."
"the light 's better , '' i instruct him ."
"`` do you know what you 're doing ? ''"
"he asks , less than thrilled to accept my help ."
"`` more than you , '' i reply with a smile , nodding at the mess of tape around his palm ."
"i wash my hands in the sink and then open up the kit ."
"i take a pair of surgical scissors and cut off the tape that he 's already applied ."
"i glance up slightly , and for the first time it hits me that he 's shirtless , wearing only a pair of gym shorts and sneakers ."
"he 's covered in sweat ."
"`` how 'd this happen ? ''"
"`` i over-trained a little ."
"got dizzy , tripped on a rock and held out my hands to break my fall , '' he replies , eyes downcast as he watches me work ."
"`` over-training for what ?"
"lacrosse or crew ? ''"
"i ask as i pull out a piece of gauze and a bottle of hydrogen peroxide ."
"`` both ."
"either , '' he murmurs ."
"`` this is going to sting , '' i warn him , as i pat the gashes on his hands with the soaked gauze ."
"he hisses slightly as the liquid stings him , but does n't move ."
"i slide my other hand under his , to stabilize it as i cleanse the wound of dirt ."
"i 've never touched him this long before ."
"`` other hand . ''"
"he switches hands and i go to work cleaning the other one ."
"`` maybe you should take a little time off from training , '' i suggest quietly ."
"`` or i could just work out my leg muscles , '' he says , and i look up to see a wry grin on his face ."
"`` mmm , '' i murmur , smiling too ."
"`` you know , '' i go on , a bit more bravely , `` i heard that only one varsity athlete got a lawn room , because sports are such a time commitment , much less a two-sport athlete- '' `` do n't do that , '' he grunts ."
"`` i do n't want your pity . ''"
"`` it 's not pity , it 's facts . ''"
"`` i was born with everything , i have no excuse for not achieving my all of goals . ''"
"`` where did you hear that ?"
"it sounds like- '' i break off , feeling him stiffen under my touch ."
"i was going to say his father but i can tell he does n't want me to go there ."
"`` you 're just really hard on yourself , that 's all , '' i say instead ."
"i gently dab some neosporin onto the cuts ."
"`` i know what everyone sees when they look at me , '' he replies quietly ."
"`` entitled ... born with a silver spoon in my mouth ... i work as hard as i do so that no one can say i succeed because of my family 's wealth . ''"
"i frown ."
"that 's half of the equation i think , but it seems like he does n't see how hard his father pushes him ."
"`` i got a little bit of that at work the other day , '' i say , wondering if it 's ok to broach the topic of the internship he wanted ."
"i take a dry piece of gauze and cover his palm with it before picking up the tape and beginning to wrap it around his hand ."
"`` when they found out i was pierce 's stepdaughter , i mean ."
"feels weird . ''"
"`` your first experience of nepotism ? ''"
"`` yeah , '' i say with a smile ."
"`` actually , my mom once got me a part-time job as the receptionist at the salon where she used to work , so i guess that 's not true . ''"
"`` where does your dad work ? ''"
"`` no idea ."
"probably a repair shop somewhere ."
"he 's a mechanic , or he was ."
"last time we heard from him was several years ago ."
"he was in florida then , but he never stays in one place very long . ''"
"`` so you 're the first in your family to go to college , '' he observes , as i finish taping one hand and move to the other ."
"`` yep . ''"
"`` is that why you 're so serious ? ''"
"`` am i ? ''"
"i ask , my eyes moving up to his ."
"`` serious is n't the right word ... distant , maybe . ''"
"`` distant ?"
"that 's worse , '' i reply , feeling a little hurt ."
"`` i did n't mean to insult you ."
"i 'm just trying to figure you out ."
"we were really in class together ?"
"which one ? ''"
"`` there were three ."
"the first was this american history survey class freshman year . ''"
"`` professor michaels ? ''"
"`` yeah ."
"i always sat behind you , though ."
"i 'm not surprised you did n't see me , '' i say , pressing down slightly as i finish wrapping his hands ."
"`` i am , '' he replies ."
"i glance up sharply , but his eyes are n't focused on my face ."
"they 're looking at my body , which i now realize is quite exposed in my thin , white cotton nightie ."
"i completely forgot i was wearing it ."
"there 's a moment of silence , and i suddenly become very aware of every inch of myself , and every inch of him ."
"his smell of sweat , beads of it still dripping forward down his chest , through a smattering of hair between his nipples ."
"allison 's face appears in my mind , and i 'm reminded of what she said ."
"`` i 'm done . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"he says , his eyes pulling up to mine ."
"`` with your hands ."
"i 'm done . ''"
"`` right . ''"
"i grab a glass from the cabinet and pour him some water from the faucet ."
"`` here , you felt dizzy because you 're dehydrated . ''"
"`` thanks , '' he says ."
"he reaches for the glass with his left hand , which is closer , and then pauses and takes it awkwardly with his right ."
"`` what was that ? ''"
"i ask , frowning ."
"`` what ? ''"
"`` let me see your left arm , '' i reply , reaching for him , but he pulls back ."
"`` no , no , it 's nothing . ''"
"`` what is ? ''"
"`` my shoulder ."
"it 's just a little tendonitis . ''"
"`` oh really ?"
"did a doctor tell you that ? ''"
"`` not exactly . ''"
"`` webmd ? ''"
"i ask , raising my eyebrows ."
"he shrugs , then winces ."
"`` you need to take better care of yourself ."
"you ca n't keep pushing yourself so hard . ''"
"he frowns , and does n't respond ."
"`` well , at least take some tylenol for the pain , '' i add as i pour two pills into my hand and begin to repack the first aid kit with the other ."
"`` that 's ok. '' i tilt my head at him ."
"`` pain is n't going to make you heal any faster , '' i point out ."
"`` fine , '' he says with a little smile ."
"i blush as his fingertips scrape my palm as he takes the pills ."
"`` well ."
"i think i 'm going back to bed ."
"i 'm supposed to check out some of the smithsonian museums later , so ... '' i trail off , feeling awkward now ."
"`` ok , see you later , '' he says , turning toward the back door ."
"i pause for a moment , then head back toward the staircase ."
"just like that , the one real conversation that my stepbrother and i have ever had is over ."
"i could practically feel him closing back up at the end there ."
"i climb the steps and shut my bedroom door behind me ."
"i feel more confused now than ever about our relationship ."
"i did n't think it could get any weirder after that peep show i gave him , but somehow this candid glimpse of him makes things even more complicated ."
"i close my eyes and try to fall back to sleep , but when my alarm goes off at ten , i 'm still wide awake ."
"chapter nine the humidity is really starting to thicken by the middle of june , and it 's a wonder that i have n't taken advantage of our pool yet ."
"the only swimsuit i have is an old athletic one-piece , and i pull it on reluctantly in my bedroom ."
"my mom keeps asking me if i want to go shopping , but i have n't taken her up on it yet ."
"all her new clothes look wonderful but i think i 'd feel uncomfortable spending so much money on myself ."
"i head down the hallway and almost bump into nate as he leaves his bedroom ."
"i reflexively cross my hands over my chest , even though i know he 's seen me in less ."
"`` hey , '' i say ."
"`` hey , '' he replies ."
"it 's the same conversation we 've had ever since i saw him in the kitchen that morning ."
"we quickly slipped into polite , but formal , interactions with each other afterward ."
"if i had to choose between this and the mind games we started out with , i might choose the mind games ."
"the doorbell rings and i start to move past him to answer it ."
"`` it 's ok i 'll get it ."
"it 's my friend jackson . ''"
"he walks down the hallway toward the stairs ."
"i follow after him , and turn toward the backyard once we 're in the foyer ."
"i hear his friend walk in just as i exit the french doors ."
"there 's a chest set against the house with the outdoor towels in it , so i grab one and set it on a chair ."
"the area around the pool it is paved with light stones before it turns into grass , and lounge chairs and a table with an umbrella are carefully set around it ."
"i turn to the pool and step gingerly onto the first step in the shallow end ."
"it 's nice-warm , but still refreshing in the hot summer day ."
"i step down the rest of the way until the water circles around my stomach , and then dive forward ."
"i swim to the other end , where the water gets darker and deeper , then push off and glide onto my back ."
"i open my eyes as i push the water past me with my hands and look up toward the house rising against the sun on my left ."
"a flash of movement in the second floor window grabs my attention ."
"there 's a figure moving there , pulling a curtain aside ."
"at first i think it 's nate-it 's his room , i think-but then i catch a glimpse of blonde hair ."
"must be his friend jackson ."
"i turn onto my stomach and dive back under the water ."
"i want nate to be the one watching me ."
"i was never much into sports , but i 've always wondered if i 'd be any good at them ."
"i push harder for the last couple laps and finally pull my head up at the shallow end , gasping for breath ."
"i take the steps back out of the pool and walk around to my towel and dry off my hair , then drape it onto the chair and lay down on it ."
"i can feel the suit clinging to my torso , and water sitting in my belly button ."
"i hear the door to the house open behind me and shield my eyes from the sun as i turn around to see who it is ."
"jackson bounds out of the door , his face spread in a genial grin ."
"`` hey , you must be brynn ."
"i 'm jackson , one of nate 's oldest friends . ''"
"`` nice to meet you , '' i say as we shake hands ."
"i notice nate lagging behind , standing just outside the door and looking reluctant to put another foot toward the pool ."
"`` come on , man , let 's get in ."
"i 've been dreaming about this pool for days . ''"
"`` we should n't bother her , she likes to be alone , '' nate says reluctantly ."
"jackson pulls off his shirt , and i look down at my interlaced fingers in my lap ."
"he 's got a great body ."
"maybe not as good as nate 's , but whose is ?"
"jackson kicks off his flip-flops and jumps in , his splash narrowly missing me ."
"nate slowly walks toward the chair furthest from me , and takes off his shirt ."
"i watch his back muscles tense as he lifts it off his head ."
"`` nate and i grew up playing lacrosse together , '' jackson says , swimming to the edge of the pool and leaning his elbows onto the deck in front of me ."
"`` hm ?"
"oh , '' i reply , as nate dives in the deep end ."
"`` so you guys go to school together ? ''"
"`` yup ."
"uva-i mean , of course you knew that . ''"
"`` which sorority are you in ? ''"
"he asks , pushing his wet hair out of his eyes ."
"`` i 'm not ."
"it 's expensive , and i 'm already pretty busy with work ."
"um , where do you go ? ''"
"nate pops up next to jackson ."
"they make quite a pair , nate with his dark eyes and jackson with his light blonde locks ."
"`` you wan na get some food now ? ''"
"nate asks ."
"`` dude we just got here ."
"besides , you 're not supposed to eat for thirty minutes after you swim . ''"
"`` before , '' nate and i both chime in ."
"we glance at each other as he continues ."
"`` you 're not supposed to eat for thirty minutes before ."
"why would n't it be ok to eat after you swim ? ''"
"`` i dunno , '' jackson replies , flashing me a blindingly white smile ."
"`` just thought that was the rule . ''"
"i find myself smiling back at him ."
"he has a boyish charm that 's infectious ."
"`` i 'm pretty sure that 's a myth adults made up so they 'd have time to eat their own lunch without the kids swimming unsupervised . ''"
"i smile ."
"`` ah that makes more sense ."
"you grow up around here ? ''"
"he asks me ."
"`` yeah , on the eastern shore . ''"
"`` oh , sweet ."
"my family has a vacation house there ."
"i love going out there ."
"sailing in the bay and everything ."
"you go sailing a lot ? ''"
"`` um , not really , '' i reply ."
"nate kicks off the wall and begins to swim back and forth behind jackson ."
"i guess he 's decided not to take it easy on his injured shoulder ."
"`` we should go some time ."
"maybe not with him , '' he replies , nodding behind him ."
"`` too competitive . ''"
"`` he is , is n't he ? ''"
"it feels nice to be able to talk about nate with someone who knows him ."
"and who will gossip ."
"`` was he always like that ? ''"
"`` oh man , always ."
"we 're like , ten years old , playing lacrosse on our school team , and coach was constantly having to pull him back during practice 'cause he was always going full out , full contact . ''"
"he and i laugh together ."
"i notice nate pause in his stroke , but i ca n't imagine he can hear us ."
"`` do you still play lacrosse ? ''"
"`` naw , i do n't really have the discipline to keep up with it ."
"i was good in high school , but you have to be great to cut it in college ."
"what sport do you play ? ''"
"`` oh , none . ''"
"`` really ?"
"you look like you 're so in shape . ''"
"`` oh , thanks , '' i reply , managing to only blush a bit ."
"from anyone else it would have seemed like a ham-fisted compliment , but jackson has such a natural , easygoing way about him ."
"`` you going to this party in georgetown tonight ? ''"
"he asks , dunking his head briefly underneath the water , then shaking off his hair like a dog ."
"`` what party ? ''"
"`` oh , i figured nate told you . ''"
"`` told her what ? ''"
"nate asks , appearing next to him ."
"`` 'bout chris 's party , '' jackson replies nonchalantly ."
"nate 's jaw muscles twitch ."
"`` had n't mentioned it , '' he replies shortly ."
"`` well , you should come , '' jackson says , turning back to me ."
"`` she 's not going to know anyone , and i think it 's just gon na be a small thing , '' nate says ."
"`` dude , chris said to invite anyone ."
"they 've got the whole townhouse ."
"it 's gon na be great . ''"
"`` i just- '' nate begins , as i bite my lip ."
"here i thought we were maybe getting along better , despite the awkwardness , and now he 's going out of his way to exclude me ."
"`` if you 're worried about being a third wheel , just invite dana or someone , '' jackson says , though even when he 's arguing , he does n't seem to have a care in the world ."
"`` so , what do you think ? ''"
"he asks me ."
"`` sounds great , actually , '' i say , glancing at nate , feeling a bit gratified as he glares at me ."
"it feels good to spite him a little , since he so clearly does n't want me to go ."
"`` awesome ."
"tonight then ."
"we can go together-i 'll pick you guys up around ten , '' jackson says , before jumping on top of nate and trying to wrestle him under the water ."
"i close my eyes as they disappear ."
"for the first time in a while , i wish i had something cute to wear ."
"chapter ten in the end , i have to go with the same black top i wore to that crew party ."
"it 's really my only top suitable for a party , i think ."
"besides , nate 's the only one who 's seen me in it , and i doubt he remembers ."
"my mom excitedly waves goodbye as nate and i walk out to jackson 's green suv ."
"she is so thrilled that i might have a social life that it 's embarrassing ."
"jackson opens up the front passenger door for me and nate slides in back ."
"`` we picking up dana ? ''"
"jackson asks as we pull away ."
"`` it 's natasha tonight ."
"and she 's meeting us there , '' nate answers from the back seat ."
"i guess i 'm relieved , because i do n't think i could look dana in the eye after seeing her and nate having sex by the pool ."
"`` oh , fuck , natasha , of course , '' jackson says , laughing and hitting the steering wheel ."
"i frown a little ."
"i guess it 's par for the course for my stepbrother ."
"jackson picks up most of the slack in the conversation , and the radio does the rest ."
"i 'm too nervous and stuck in my head , thinking of what i should say , while nate mumbles one word responses from the back ."
"i 'm relieved when we find a parking space on the street near the party ."
"as we walk toward the riotous townhouse , i 'm surprised the neighbors have n't already called the cops ."
"people are spilling out the front door and i can hear the music halfway down the block ."
"there 's a pretty olive-skinned girl standing on the curb who turns her head as nate calls out , `` natasha ! ''"
"she smiles coyly as we walk up ."
"nate dips her in a jokingly romantic manner and plants a kiss on her lips as she breaks out into giggles ."
"`` come on , '' jackson says , draping an arm around my shoulders protectively and escorting me inside ."
"he high-fives a few guys as we walk in , and he guides me to a keg in the middle of the living room , which is strung with little white christmas lights ."
"there 's an impenetrable crowd around it but somehow he manages to snag me a beer , and before i know it i 'm taking my first sip of the summer ."
"with his hand on the small of my back , we walk into the next room ."
"the dining room table is being used for a beer pong game , and jackson and i take a seat on a couch nearby ."
"`` you 're gorgeous , you know that ? ''"
"jackson whispers in my ear ."
"i 'm startled and almost spit out my beer ."
"`` no ... '' i look down , blushing , `` i mean , that 's sweet of you to say . ''"
"`` i 'd love to see you again after tonight ."
"maybe we could get dinner next weekend , '' he offers ."
"`` oh , sure , '' i reply , feeling flattered ."
"i mean , it does feel a little ... rushed , or something , but i 've heard so many stories about guys just wanting to hook up , that it 's refreshing to be asked out on an old-fashioned date ."
"i take a few more sips of my beer as i look around , feeling more comfortable now that i know jackson is really into me ."
"`` hey , i 'm going to get another beer , '' i tell jackson , as i drain mine ."
"he jumps up ."
"`` do n't worry about it ."
"i 'll grab 'em , '' he says , walking confidently into the other room ."
"i watch the ping pong ball as it 's thrown back and forth across the table , and jackson is soon back with the beers ."
"he launches into a story about this crazy party he went to back at school , but out of the corner of my eye i notice a couple walking up the stairs at the rear of the room , their hands all over each other , and feel a stab of envy in my chest ."
"i am beyond tired of being a virgin ."
"it 's certainly not on purpose that i 'm twenty-one and still have n't had sex yet ."
"i guess i just assumed it would happen somehow , without my ever putting any thought into it , and i 've never built it up like it 's going to be some crazy special thing , either ."
"i look at jackson out of the corner of my eye as i make quick work of my second beer ."
"maybe nate was right-maybe i am too serious and distant ."
"maybe it would be better if i just got it out of the way ."
"and i bet jackson would be good at it ."
"really , really good at it ."
"plus , he 's a decent guy ."
"`` ... do n't you think ? ''"
"jackson asks me , leaning in ."
"`` yes , right , '' i reply , even though i spaced out and have no idea what he was talking about ."
"my hair falls in front of my face as i take another sip of beer , and jackson reaches up and tucks it behind my ear ."
"we make eye contact and he leans forward slowly , brushing a soft kiss across my neck ."
"`` want to get out of here ? ''"
"he murmurs into my ear , sending a little shiver down my spine ."
"`` my place is pretty close by , and we 'll actually be able to hear ourselves think . ''"
"`` um , yeah , that sounds good , '' i reply , a little nervously ."
"jackson stands and offers me his hand ."
"i place mine in his and he leads me out toward the front ."
"we pass nate on the way , with his arms wrapped around natasha and his hands tucked into her back pockets ."
"`` hey man , we 're taking off ."
"you think you can find another ride ? ''"
"jackson asks ."
"`` what do you mean ?"
"you 're both leaving ? ''"
"nate asks , frowning ."
"`` yup , we 're going back to my place , dude , '' jackson replies ."
"`` you cool for a ride ? ''"
"`` yeah , come here for a second , '' nate says , his eyes flicking back and forth between us ."
"he takes jackson 's arm and pulls him toward a screen door in the back ."
"`` not you , '' he says to me , as i begin to follow ."
"i bristle at his tone ."
"they disappear out back and i look after them , my mouth open in shock and annoyance ."
"i ca n't believe the way nate talks to me sometimes ."
"so dismissively ."
"i exchange a polite smile with natasha , who is now looking around the party aimlessly , clearly bored without nate ."
"screw nate ."
"i 'll do whatever the hell i please , and i want to know what he 's saying ."
"i brush past natasha , push open the screen door and walk into the small , fenced-in backyard ."
"there are fewer people out here , but there 's still a crowd ."
"i can just see nate and jackson talking in a back corner ."
"i weave my way through the people , keeping my head down so they do n't notice me ."
"i take out my phone so i look like i 'm doing something other than eavesdropping , and sidle into the group nearest to them ."
"i can just overhear what they 're saying ."
"`` why , do you want her nate ? ''"
"jackson asks angrily ."
"my eyes widen ."
"`` fuck no , she 's my stepsister ."
"it 's just weird , that 's all ."
"you two ."
"she 's not your type . ''"
"i feel a stab of pain at the finality of nate 's words ."
"`` she 's gorgeous , '' i hear jackson reply ."
"`` you think she 's gorgeous ? ''"
"nate says , beginning to laugh ."
"`` seriously ?"
"dude , come on ."
"besides , she 's a fucking buzz kill . ''"
"i do n't want to hear any more ."
"i can already feel angry tears building up behind my eyes ."
"i 'm so stupid ."
"why do i keep giving nate the benefit of the doubt , when he is so clearly such an asshole ?"
"i walk quickly back inside , through the living room , and out to the street ."
"i turn toward the left , where i can see a busier street , and hustle toward it ."
"i know it 's going to be a pricey cab ride back to the house , but i feel like i 'm about to explode into a puddle of tears ."
"and i do n't want to give nate the satisfaction of seeing me cry ."
"chapter eleven i breathe in as deeply as possible and hold it , counting to ten before exhaling as slowly as i can , trying to rid myself of the hurt feeling that followed me home from the party ."
"it 's a trick i learned to control my anxiety , and to say that i 'm anxious right now would be an understatement ."
"i ca n't remember the last time i heard someone talk about me like that , though i suppose it 's partially my fault for eavesdropping ."
"i finally start to feel calm enough to go to sleep , and reach to turn off my bedside lamp ."
"a rush of footsteps up the stairs makes me pause ."
"i sit up a bit as they continue down the hallway toward my bedroom ."
"a second later , my bedroom door bursts open and nate walks in , his face dark with anger ."
"`` you 're in bed ?"
"you 've got ta be fucking kidding me ."
"that was really selfish of you to run off without telling anyone , you know that ? ''"
"he spits at me , then turns around and walks out ."
"i 'm frozen in shock for a moment ."
"what the hell was that ?"
"what does he have to be mad at me for ?"
"i leap out from under my covers and march out of my bedroom just in time to stop him from shutting his door ."
"he swings around as i charge into his room ."
"`` i 'm selfish ?"
"you are just ... you are just ... '' i stumble in my anger , trying to think of the right word ."
"`` yeah , you 're selfish , brynn !"
"i looked around that party for you for thirty minutes !"
"i thought you might have been kidnapped !"
"i almost called the cops ! ''"
"`` wait ... what ? ''"
"i reply , completely thrown ."
"`` ever heard of a text message ? ''"
"he asks , his voice laden with sarcasm ."
"`` yes , i 've heard of a text message ! ''"
"man , i wish i were better at arguing ."
"`` hey , wait a second , this is n't about me , this is about you !"
"you 're the asshole !"
"i heard what you were saying about me to jackson , i 'm not a buzzkill , and maybe i 'm not gorgeous , but i 'm not some kind of joke , either ! ''"
"i fight back the tears welling in my eyes , more angry than i 've ever been in my life ."
"there , that got him ."
"he stands dumbfounded and i seize the opportunity to walk out ."
"just as i 'm about to cross the threshold , he reaches around me and closes the door in front of me ."
"i stop short and turn around angrily , almost ready to smack him ."
"he 's standing so close to me i 'm practically pinned against the door ."
"`` wait , what ?"
"how 'd you hear that ?"
"you followed us outside ? ''"
"`` yes , i followed you , '' i reply , stumbling a bit because i know i was wrong in that regard ."
"`` i was mad because you were obviously trying to stop me from leaving with jackson , and i wanted to know why . ''"
"i take a deep breath ."
"`` i guess i ca n't control what you think about me , and that 's ... whatever , that 's fine , but i do n't know why you had to go sharing your opinion with jackson ."
"i mean , am i really that unattractive to you ? ''"
"to my horror , my lower lip starts to tremble ."
"i do n't want to cry right now but i ca n't hold back the tears any longer ."
"`` no ... shit , that 's not what ... '' nate says , his eyes widen as a tear slips down my cheek ."
"i furiously brush it away and nate backs up , running his hands through his wavy hair ."
"`` it 's not that i do n't want jackson to date you , it 's that i do n't want you to date jackson . ''"
"`` what ?"
"that does n't make any sense , '' i reply , trying to staunch the flow of tears as i tug at my hair ."
"`` jackson 's track record with women is pretty bad ."
"they 're just conquests to him . ''"
"i cross my arms and frown at him ."
"`` that sounds pretty hypocritical ."
"i mean , the first time we met , you asked me to have a threesome with you and you did n't even know my name . ''"
"a smile tugs at the corner of his mouth ."
"`` ok , that 's fair ."
"for the record , you just looked so shocked , and innocent-i could n't resist ."
"you 're right , it 's not like i have a great track record either ."
"i guess the difference , in my mind , is that i 'm upfront about it ."
"i 've never promised a woman a relationship ."
"the girls i sleep with , they know that it 's not going anywhere because i tell them that ."
"jackson pulls them in by promising them a future with him , and then as soon as he sleeps with them , he acts like they do n't exist . ''"
"`` but you 're friends with him ... '' i point out ."
"`` well , he 's a good friend ."
"loyal , funny ... '' `` but he sounds like a bad person ."
"i just ..."
"i do n't know why you 'd want to be friends with a person like that ."
"sorry , maybe i 'm just ... '' i shake my head , trying to process this new version of events ."
"`` he did ... what you just said about him does match up with some things he was saying to me ."
"god , i ca n't believe i fell for it . ''"
"`` he was n't always like that , '' nate says quietly , gesturing vaguely to a framed photo sitting on his desk ."
"i glance at it , then walk over to get a closer look ."
"`` oh my god , is that you ? ''"
"i ask , picking it up ."
"it 's a class photo from elementary school , three rows of smiling kids with their teacher standing next to them ."
"nate is easy to spot ."
"`` you look so serious , like you 're on the way to the office or something . ''"
"nate peers over my shoulder at it , his face an exact reflection of his younger self ."
"`` that was the year my mom left , '' he says quietly ."
"`` oh ."
"oh , i 'm sorry ."
"do you ever see her ? ''"
"`` no ."
"she made her choice . ''"
"he pauses for a moment ."
"`` that one 's jackson , '' he says , pointing out a grinning towheaded boy ."
"i snort ."
"he had a flirtatious smile even back then ."
"`` i 'm sorry you heard me say those things ."
"jackson 's the kind of guy who , if you tell him something 's off limits , that makes him want it even more ."
"he 's never been denied anything ."
"so i thought it would be better to convince him that he did n't want you in the first place . ''"
"i fiddle with the edge of the frame and then turn to face him ."
"he 's standing closer than i thought he was ."
"`` so ... you do n't think those things about me ? ''"
"i whisper , feeling suddenly vulnerable ."
"`` no , the exact opposite , really , '' he replies , equally softly ."
"`` brynn you are gorgeous . ''"
"there 's a charged moment between us ."
"i ca n't rip my gaze away from his eyes ."
"i realize he 's moving forward ever so slowly , and my lips automatically part , my body taking over from my brain ."
"every inch of my skin tingles , and i suddenly feel brave-a completely different reaction than anything i 've ever felt being this close to jackson ."
"just before his mouth touches mine , i close my eyes ."
"as our lips come together , an exquisite feeling rushes through me , unlike anything i 've ever felt before ."
"his lips graze mine , then return a bit more firmly , guiding me into a kiss ."
"i 've been kissed by a handful of guys over the years , but this kiss is something else ."
"nate is something else ."
"his hands wrap around my waist and slide to the small of my back as his lips crush against mine ."
"all my thoughts evaporate , all my worries and insecurities-maybe it 's that i can tell he knows exactly what he 's doing , and so i can let myself go , trust myself in his hands ."
"he nudges me slightly with his nose and his lower lip brushes against mine ."
"i almost gasp as i feel his tongue move smoothly into my mouth ."
"electricity flies straight from my mouth to the base of my hips ."
"i press my tongue against his as my hands move of their own accord up to his chest ."
"i lay my palms against his pecs and feel his racing heartbeat under his rapidly rising and falling chest ."
"it 's my first hint that there 's something else hiding under his completely confident exterior ."
"his tongue moves deeper into my mouth , and his hands pull me close against his body ."
"i wrap my arms around his neck and run my fingers through the hair falling onto the collar of his polo ."
"i can feel his erection pushing against my stomach as he slides one hand over my ass ."
"i want nothing more than to rip my clothes off , jump on his bed , and be ravaged by him ... to feel his mouth all over my body ... inside me ..."
"suddenly he pulls away ."
"i almost fall forward in surprise as my eyes blink open ."
"`` i should n't have done that , '' he mutters ."
"`` why ? ''"
"i whisper , falling quickly from my cloud ."
"`` it 's wrong ... you 're my stepsister ."
"maybe it 's best if we just keep our distance from each other . ''"
"`` yeah , you 're right ... '' i reply , feeling like he 's just slapped me in the face ."
"i walk quickly to the door ."
"i pause before i open it , wishing i could put into words what i 'm feeling , but i ca n't ."
"i open the door and close it softly behind me before rushing to my room ."
"as i curl up under the covers , i try to wrap my mind around all the twists this night has taken ."
"i ca n't believe nate and i just kissed ."
"i mean , i 've been dreaming about that moment since i first laid eyes on him freshman year ."
"i 've found that most things in life do n't live up to how i 've built them up in my head , but that kiss far surpassed any fantasy ."
"i can feel my body reacting at just the thought of his lips touching mine again ."
"but is he right ?"
"was it wrong of us to do that ?"
"light is creeping around the sides of my shades by the time i manage to fall asleep , and i still have n't managed to find an answer ."
"chapter twelve nate and i pass the next few weeks as though we 're each surrounded by an invisible force field ."
"whenever one of us enters a room , the other is propelled out of it ."
"we 're only pushed into close proximity with each other when we have a family dinner , though my mom has been pushing those on us quite frequently in an effort to bond ."
"if she only knew ."
"today , though , nate 's and my presence is required at the same event : the thornhill 's annual fourth of july party ."
"it 's in our very own backyard , starting in the afternoon with a crab boil and extending through the evening fireworks ."
"apparently we 'll get a good view of the country club 's annual fireworks display just down the river ."
"my mom has absolutely insisted on buying me a new dress for the occasion , and even came into the fitting room with me to make sure it fit correctly ."
"the shift dress is not exactly my style , but i 've seen it on plenty of girls at school ."
"i 'm just worried about spilling tartar sauce on the bright white fabric ."
"i pull on my new pair of gold wedges , and walk downstairs to see if my mom needs any help ."
"i 'm taken aback by the flurry of activity downstairs ."
"as i walk outside , i realize i 've underestimated the scale of this party ."
"when i heard `` crab boil , '' i was picturing a few picnic tables with red and white tablecloths , but this is clearly a classy affair ."
"there are elegant round tables set , with flowing linens and extravagant centerpieces on top of them ."
"the food is presented in silver trays , and garlands festoon the perimeter ."
"i spot my mom talking in hushed , urgent tones to one of the caterers , and head over ."
"`` oh , brynn , you look beautiful !"
"that dress fits you so well , '' she gushes ."
"`` thanks ... do you need any help ? ''"
"`` mmm , no ."
"i think we 're ok ."
"the guests should begin arriving in about ten minutes ."
"oh , go taste the freedom martini over at the bar and tell me what you think ."
"i 'm worried it 's a little too sweet . ''"
"`` the freedom martini ? ''"
"`` the signature cocktail we created for this event , '' the caterer next to her chimes in with a chipper grin ."
"`` ah , of course , '' i reply , heading for the bar ."
"the bartender serves me a pale pink drink and i take a sip ."
"not too sweet-it 's delicious , light and refreshing ."
"luckily the day is n't too hot , anyway ."
"the temperature has managed to stay below ninety degrees for the party ."
"i decide to go down to the river since i 'd just feel in the way while they 're setting up ."
"i walk down to the lower lawn and down the steps ."
"as i reach the shore , i navigate the rocky sand cautiously in my heels ."
"a splash on the other side of the large boulder grabs my attention ."
"i walk toward it and peer around ."
"nate 's standing there , skipping rocks with a smooth sidearm motion ."
"i pause , admiring his form , then decide it 's best to just go back up to the lawn before he notices me ."
"he 's made it clear he does n't want to talk to me ."
"i turn back and as i walk my heel catches on a rock ."
"i gasp as i slip sideways , and feel two strong hands catching me under my arms to hold me up ."
"`` whoa , careful , '' he says as he straightens me up ."
"`` thanks , '' i reply as i turn to him and tuck my hair back behind my ears ."
"`` you escaping from the commotion , too ? ''"
"`` yeah ."
"i do n't really enjoy these things . ''"
"`` really ?"
"you 're so ... '' i trail off ."
"`` what ? ''"
"he asks with a grin ."
"i groan ."
"`` fine ."
"i was going to say 'charming , ' ok ? ''"
"`` i knew it , '' he replies jokingly ."
"`` well , whatever charm you might be noticing has been developed over many years of practice ."
"my dad has been dragging me to these kinds of events for years ."
"i know the routine ."
"smile , shake hands , tell the kinds of jokes that do n't make anyone think too hard . ''"
"`` sounds ... horrible ."
"but at least there 's a lot of free food . ''"
"he gives me a bemused glance ."
"`` right ."
"sometimes i forget i do n't have to worry about that stuff anymore . ''"
"`` you were , um , not well-off before our parents- '' he drops his gaze ."
"`` i 'd say we were struggling ."
"but it was just the way i grew up ."
"i never wanted for anything big , though we certainly frequented the goodwill racks often enough ."
"but i do n't want you to think ... i mean , my mom , she really cares for pierce . ''"
"`` relax-i do n't think your mom 's a gold digger ."
"there have always been some of those around , and i can practically smell them at this point ."
"i mean , maybe at first i was worried , but i 'm not now . ''"
"`` was your mom- '' i begin , feeling brave ."
"`` i do n't like to talk about her , '' he cuts me off , and chucks another rock out onto the water ."
"it hits the surface with a plopping sound and sinks ."
"`` sorry , '' i whisper ."
"`` how 's your shoulder ? ''"
"`` hurts , '' he replies shortly ."
"`` i 'll see you up there , '' i say after a moment , since he 's clearly done with the conversation ."
"`` hey , '' he calls after me as i climb the steps ."
"`` jackson and his parents are here ."
"they 're family friends ."
"they 're on the guest list every year . ''"
"`` got it , thanks , '' i reply , before mounting the rest of the steps ."
"that was considerate of him , and it sounds like he was telling me that he did n't invite jackson himself ."
"as i walk across the lawn , i can see that the first guests are beginning to arrive ."
"i wonder if now that i 'm pierce 's stepdaughter , i 'm going be expected to put on the same song-and-dance routine as nate ."
"usually if i have to go to a party , like my aunt 's christmas party , i 'll hang out for a while , and then disappear somewhere to read a book ."
"my fears are realized as my mom waves me over to where she and pierce are standing with two guests ."
"i 'm introduced to the couple , who turn out to be higher-ups for the state department , and my accomplishments are trotted out while they murmur enthusiastically , though i have to wonder if anyone could possibly be genuinely interested in such self-serving prattle ."
"as we talk , my mom breaks away to greet the guests that are now pouring in ."
"i listen politely as pierce chats away , impressed with his wit and charm ."
"clearly nate gets it from his dad , even if he does insist that it 's a learned skill ."
"i manage to slip away and head over to the buffet table ."
"like any good maryland girl , i absolutely love crabs ."
"as i pile my plate high , i feel a hand on the small of my back ."
"i turn to see jackson grinning at me ."
"with his open , friendly face , it 's hard to keep in mind what nate told me about him , and what i experienced for myself ."
"`` hey , brynn ! ''"
"he says , brushing a kiss against my cheek ."
"`` jackson , good to see you , '' i reply politely ."
"`` you disappeared so fast the last time i saw you !"
"i was worried , '' he replies ."
"`` sorry about that , '' i respond , wondering if nate gave him any explanation ."
"`` we ever going to go on that date ? ''"
"i 'm saved by the sight of allison walking out onto the deck ."
"`` could you excuse me for a moment ?"
"my best friend just got here and she does n't know anyone else , '' i explain as i slip away ."
"i wave at her as i approach , but she 's looking around nervously and does n't register my presence ."
"`` allison ! ''"
"i call out , just ten feet from her ."
"`` oh !"
"oh my gosh , i did n't recognize you , '' she says ."
"i give her a hug as i walk up ."
"`` this party is really fancy !"
"and this house !"
"i mean you said it was big , but i did n't think it was this big . ''"
"`` i know , '' i groan ."
"`` i 'll give you a tour later if you have a couple hours , '' i add wryly ."
"`` come get something to eat with me-i was just filling up a plate ."
"i 'm so glad you 're here ."
"i do n't really know anyone else , and none of the interns have shown up yet . ''"
"`` the interns ? ''"
"allison asks as we head back over to the buffet , where i pick up my abandoned plate ."
"`` yeah , pierce invited all the interns from the office . ''"
"`` oh , that was nice of him , '' allison comments , picking up her own plate ."
"`` wow , i think that guy 's a senator ... the one in the blue seersucker jacket . ''"
"i glance over ."
"`` from georgia , yeah , '' i confirm ."
"`` i think he and pierce served in congress at the same time . ''"
"i start giggling and allison looks at me with a questioning smile ."
"`` sorry , i just ca n't believe i 'm talking about my stepfather serving in congress . ''"
"`` this is your real life ! ''"
"allison says , laughing ."
"`` when do you think it 'll sink in ? ''"
"`` no idea , '' i reply as we head toward a couple empty seats at one of the tables ."
"`` your mom looks really happy , '' allison observes as we sit ."
"i watch her for a moment , flitting between conversations , so beautiful and animated ."
"`` i think she is ."
"and she 's just really good at cocktail-type conversation , too ."
"like nate , though he says it does n't come to him naturally . ''"
"`` brynn ... '' allison says , raising an eyebrow at me ."
"`` no , i mean , i 'm just , you know ... '' i reply , trailing off ."
"definitely not the time to tell allison that nate and i kissed , though i do n't know if that time will ever come ."
"i love allison , but thinking in shades of grey is not her strong suit ."
"`` thought you two could use some drinks . ''"
"i look up to see greg , the cute intern with the strawberry-blonde hair , standing next to us , three martini glasses carefully balanced between his long fingers ."
"`` greg , hi !"
"i 'm so glad you could make it . ''"
"i indicate the chair next to us and help him place down the glasses so that they do n't spill their contents ."
"`` greg , this is my friend allison ."
"we go to college together . ''"
"`` nice to meet you , '' allison says ."
"`` you too ."
"hope these drinks are ok with you ."
"i forget what the bartender called them ... '' `` freedom martinis , '' i answer , rolling my eyes ."
"`` the name sucks , but they 're really good . ''"
"`` so where are you from originally , greg ? ''"
"allison asks ."
"`` raleigh , though i hope to move to dc after i graduate . ''"
"i tune out slightly as allison and greg talk across me ."
"i 've just seen nate cross between groups of people , seeming to make conversation effortlessly ."
"i look around to see if there 's a girl trailing him , but i do n't see one ."
"this might be the first time i 've seen him without a date at any kind of gathering ."
"the idea that it could be because of me comes to my mind , but i quickly quash it ."
"i ca n't let myself think like that ."
"nate does n't want that kind of relationship with me , probably even if i were n't his stepsister ."
"i bet his date just got a cold last-minute or something ."
"`` be right back , '' allison says ."
"`` i have to get a second helping ! ''"
"my attention snaps back to greg as she stands and leaves ."
"he scratches his cheek and clears his throat ."
"i smile as a blush sneaks onto his freckle-dotted skin ."
"`` you look ... um , that 's a nice dress , '' he finally says ."
"`` thanks . ''"
"i smile , careful not to linger on the subject , `` so , you think you 'll want to work in politics after school ends ? ''"
"`` well , in government , '' he says with a smile ."
"`` though i 'm learning that one does n't seem to exist without the other ."
"i guess i need to work on the whole ... you know ... '' he waves his hand vaguely ."
"`` kissing babies thing ? ''"
"`` exactly , '' he smiles ."
"`` so , ah , i was wondering ... '' my attention drifts from him again as i see my mom and pierce talking urgently by the house ."
"my mom covers her face with her hands and pierce turns back to the party , his frown turning into a smile as if by magic ."
"`` i 'm so sorry , greg , could you excuse me ?"
"i think my mom might need me . ''"
"`` oh , sure , '' he replies kindly as i rush toward the door into the study ."
"my mind runs through the possible scenarios as i hurry through the study and up the stairs ."
"as i climb the second set of stairs up to the master suite on the third floor , i decide it must be my father ."
"the last time i saw my mom look that upset , it was because my dad was back in town and pressuring her for money ."
"i knock softly on the closed double door of their bedroom ."
"`` mom ? ''"
"i whisper quietly as i let myself in ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"i gasp as i hurry in ."
"she 's curled up on top of the bedspread , like a broken doll ."
"`` it 's pierce , '' she murmurs without moving ."
"`` his lawyer just called him ."
"a woman has come forward accusing him of sexual harassment ."
"it 'll be on the news tomorrow . ''"
"chapter thirteen `` oh no , '' i whisper , sitting next to her on the bed ."
"`` i 'm so sorry , mom . ''"
"`` is it ... is it me ? ''"
"she asks , turning her head as a tear drops down her cheek ."
"`` what ?"
"what do you mean ? ''"
"`` maybe it 's me ... maybe it 's my fault ."
"it 's like i 'm a curse . ''"
"`` no , mom , no , '' i whisper , leaning down and pulling her hair out of her eyes ."
"`` this is n't happening because of you ."
"i mean , when did this even go on ?"
"the , you know , the ... '' i reply , unable to repeat those two ugly words : sexual harassment ."
"`` several years ago , '' she replies ."
"`` long before he ever met you , '' i point out ."
"`` so , what ?"
"this woman 's going on tv ? ''"
"my mom nods ."
"`` one of those investigation shows is doing a piece about sexual harassment in politics , and she 's going to be interviewed . ''"
"`` what are you going to do ? ''"
"`` well , we 'll have to batten down the hatches ."
"we 'll probably have to stay in the house for a few days , though luckily tomorrow 's saturday anyway . ''"
"`` no , that 's not what i meant ."
"i mean , if pierce sexually harassed a- '' `` i do n't want to think about it . ''"
"`` mom , you have to , '' i sigh ."
"she 's always been like the child in our relationship ."
"i 'm tired of the dynamic , but i do n't know how to break the pattern without our entire relationship falling apart ."
"`` if pierce did that , then maybe you have to- '' `` do n't say it ."
"pierce and i are staying together ."
"that 's not a question ."
"and even if he did do it , i 'm sure it was a momentary weakness ."
"it was just something that happened a long time ago , and he 's changed . ''"
"i shrug , feeling helpless ."
"`` i want that to be true , mom , i really do ."
"not for his sake , but for yours ."
"i did hear a rumor at work , though , '' i say hesitatingly ."
"`` what do you mean ?"
"what kind of rumor ? ''"
"`` that ... pierce has a certain reputation . ''"
"`` why did n't you tell me ? ''"
"i want to tell her that it 's because she 's so fragile , but instead i just reply , `` because it was just a rumor that i heard from one person ."
"i had no way of knowing if it were true . ''"
"`` well , until there 's some evidence or something , i 'm going to believe pierce ."
"he said she was a woman at work who was denied a promotion she wanted , and now she 's starting a jewelry line , and thought she might as well put her bitterness to good use and drum up some publicity . ''"
"`` i guess that could be it , '' i say without conviction ."
"my mom nods ."
"`` i think i just want to be alone for a while ."
"do you think you could go back to the party , and sort of act like the hostess for me ?"
"you know , make sure everyone 's having a good time and all that ?"
"just say i have a headache if anyone asks after me . ''"
"`` um , alright , '' i reply , not knowing what else to say ."
"`` thanks , honey , '' my mom says , settling back onto the pillow ."
"i stand and head for the door ."
"`` i just ca n't believe it , '' i hear her murmur as i close the bedroom door behind me ."
"i wish i did n't believe it either , but there 's a telltale knot in the pit of my stomach that 's telling me i do ."
"i head back down to the party , taking the stairs slowly ."
"i 'd rather be doing pretty much anything else right now than plastering a smile on my face and pretending everything 's fine ."
"but i know my mom 's right-it will look odd if both of us disappear during the party ."
"i reemerge out back and take a deep breath as i cross back over to greg and allison ."
"`` sorry about that ."
"my mom has a headache , i just wanted to check on her , '' i relay dutifully ."
"greg and allison murmur sympathetically ."
"i finish the rest of my food quickly , and with only one ear on their conversation , before standing up with my drink ."
"i excuse myself and begin to mingle , trying to circulate and play the part of the hostess like my mom asked ."
"i watch the fading light impatiently ; willing the sun to set as fast as possible so that this party can finally be over ."
"the chipper event organizer i met earlier appears quietly at my side as i force a laugh at a partygoer 's joke ."
"`` have you seen mrs ."
"thornhill ? ''"
"it still throws me to hear my mom referred to like that ."
"`` she 's not feeling well ."
"can i help you with something ? ''"
"`` would you like the lanterns to be lit now , or should we wait ? ''"
"i glance around at the dimming light ."
"`` now would be fine , thanks . ''"
"she hurries away and i spot nate across the party , frowning at me ."
"i avert my gaze quickly ."
"if his dad has n't told him what 's going on yet , i do n't want the task to fall on me ."
"i see him making his way over , and excuse myself from my current conversation to disappear into a large group of people around the pool ."
"just another hour or so and the fireworks will be done , and everyone will leave ."
"the caterers move throughout the party , lighting candles on the tables and mini chinese lanterns strung in the trees ."
"i take a moment to admire the scene : the beautiful white lights , the well-heeled crowd , the murmur of easy conversation ."
"my mom does know how to throw a good party ."
"i grab another drink as the twilight turns into night and people begin heading down to the lower lawn to get a better view of the fireworks ."
"with a sudden boom , the display begins ."
"there are a few exclamations of excitement and some clapping as the crowd gathers to stare downriver at the explosions of color ."
"i 'm making my way toward the rear of the crowd when i feel a hand on the small of my back ."
"i know before i even turn around that it 's nate ."
"`` what 's going on ? ''"
"he asks quietly , as i turn to face him ."
"`` it 's nothing ."
"my mom just is n't feeling well , '' i reply ."
"`` you 're pulling at your hair , '' he points out , and i drop my hand , feeling caught ."
"the crowd cheers as an especially colorful firework goes off above us ."
"`` so ? ''"
"`` i can read you like a book , brynn , '' he replies , leaning in ."
"i can feel his breath on my cheek and step back , feeling flustered ."
"`` i just think it 's something that your dad should tell you , '' i say , and turn back to the fireworks , but i feel his hand on my elbow ."
"`` would you just tell me ?"
"you and my dad are both acting strangely , and now your mom disappears ... i just want to know . ''"
"`` and here i thought i was covering well , '' i say , stalling for time ."
"`` maybe to other people , but not to me . ''"
"i stare at him for a moment as his features are illuminated by the light of one of my favorite , willow-shaped fireworks ."
"`` there 's a woman ... she 's going to go on the news tomorrow and say that your dad sexually harassed her . ''"
"`` that 's crazy , '' he hisses at me ."
"`` i 'm just the messenger-you insisted i tell you- '' i stammer , taken aback by his tone ."
"`` my dad , he 's a great man ."
"he 's a pillar of the community- '' `` a pillar of the community ? ''"
"`` what ?"
"he is ! ''"
"`` it 's just , sometimes the way you talk about him ... he 's not perfect , nate . ''"
"`` you do n't know anything about him ."
"when my mom abandoned us , he took care of me all by himself ."
"he 's always been there for me . ''"
"`` ok , i 'm just- '' but nate storms off back to the house ."
"i stand in shock for a moment ."
"i knew that conversation was n't going to be fun , but i did n't think he 'd turn on me like that , as though i were attacking pierce , or something ."
"i turn back toward the crowd just as the finale begins and the sky lights up ."
"i glance at the people around me , their faces upturned , their expressions joyous ."
"maybe it was silly of me to look forward to everyone leaving ."
"because now i realize that tomorrow , it will be back to the four of us alone in the house-and no buffer zone ."
"my eyes fall on pierce and i realize he 's staring at me ."
"he smiles quickly when he realizes that i 'm looking at him , and leads the applause as the last firework dies out ."
"chapter fourteen i was half-worried that the plan was for all four of us to watch the tv program together , but thankfully there 's no such expectation ."
"or at least , i have n't been told of it ."
"it 's the first time in a while my mom has n't insisted on a family dinner ."
"she 's been holed up in her room most of the day , while pierce fields calls from his attorneys in his study ."
"i decide to grab some leftover pasta from the fridge to eat in my room , and peer into nate 's room as i pass ."
"no sign of him ."
"i shut my door behind me and open my computer to check out some of the coverage online ."
"i feel nauseous as i read the woman 's claims , though slightly relieved that she is n't accusing pierce of any kind of violence ."
"she talks mostly about lingering touches , shoulder massages , and being stonewalled by management when she complained ."
"i finish eating and click around the internet for a while , feeling restless ."
"when i ca n't stand my boredom any longer , i take my plate and walk back down to the kitchen and put it in the dishwasher ."
"the phone on the counter rings as i 'm headed past it ."
"i pause for a moment , waiting to see if someone else is going to answer it ."
"what if it 's a reporter ?"
"do i just say 'no comment , ' like they do on tv ?"
"on the third ring , i decide to bite the bullet ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"`` hi , is nate there ? ''"
"a female voice asks breathlessly ."
"ah , another admirer ."
"`` sorry , i do n't think he is , '' i reply honestly ."
"`` can i take a message ? ''"
"there 's a slight pause ."
"`` is this holly ? ''"
"`` no , this is her daughter , brynn ."
"may i ask who 's calling ? ''"
"there 's another long pause , and i begin to feel uneasy ."
"`` it 's eileen ... nate 's mom . ''"
"i almost drop the phone in surprise ."
"`` oh , um , i don't- '' `` wait !"
"please , please do n't hang up ."
"i just saw the news , and thought that nate might be willing to talk to me now . ''"
"`` i do n't understand . ''"
"`` because he 'll know the truth about pierce , and then maybe he wo n't believe whatever he says about me . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry , i do n't think i should be in the middle of this . ''"
"whatever it is ."
"`` please , please ... '' i hear her gasp and the clear sound of crying ."
"`` i have n't talked to nate in so long ... he 's my son , he 's my son . ''"
"`` but you chose to leave him ... '' `` is that what pierce told you ? ''"
"`` no , nate . ''"
"`` he heard it from pierce ."
"i left pierce because he was cheating on me ."
"but pierce is used to having everything his own way , and he was furious ."
"he was the one with the money , i came into the marriage with nothing , and signed a pre-nup ."
"i mean , i barely even looked at the thing at the time-i thought we 'd be together forever ."
"he had an expensive lawyer and managed to get full custody in the divorce ."
"i never had a chance ."
"i 've been trying to get in touch with nate for years to tell him the truth ... i left pierce , not nate ."
"i would never leave my son ."
"i never would have divorced pierce , even though he was cheating on me , if i had known i 'd never see my son again ."
"i thought after seeing this woman on tv , maybe he 'd believe me ... '' she dissolves into sobs ."
"`` eileen , eileen , it 's ok , '' i whisper , feeling sick ."
"something about what she 's telling me rings true ."
"i can feel it in my gut ."
"`` i want to help you , but ... nate , he 's really touchy about his father ."
"i do n't know what i can do . ''"
"`` i know , and i 'm sorry to put this on you ."
"i call the house now and then trying to get nate , and i was just hoping that he would pick up tonight and not hang up on me . ''"
"a sound behind me makes me fly around ."
"pierce is standing in the doorway to the dining room ."
"`` everything ok ? ''"
"he asks ."
"`` yep , everything 's fine , pierce , '' i reply so that eileen can hear me ."
"`` just take down my number , alright ? ''"
"eileen says quietly ."
"`` please , just tell him what i said . ''"
"i write the number down on a small notepad on the counter , conscious that pierce is watching me ."
"`` got it , thanks ."
"talk to you later , '' i say , and hang up ."
"`` not a reporter , i hope , '' pierce says with a sad smile ."
"`` no , just a friend , '' i reply as nonchalantly as possible , and rip the paper off the pad and stuff it in my pocket ."
"`` god , this has been the longest day of my life , '' he says with a sigh , running his fingers through his hair ."
"`` i hope you and your mom do n't get dragged into anything ."
"there might be some reporters hanging out by the gate tomorrow ."
"probably best to just avoid them . ''"
"`` sure , no problem . ''"
"he looks so tired , and i find myself quickly feeling sorry for him ."
"he seems so genuine right now that it 's hard to believe what eileen and this other woman are saying about him ."
"the man in front of me paints such a different picture ."
"`` on the other hand , though , i 'm glad that you and your mom are here right now ."
"maybe it 's selfish of me ."
"but i do n't think i 'd make it through all this without her ."
"she 's really brought light back into my life . ''"
"`` she 's ... yeah , she 's great , '' i reply awkwardly ."
"`` are you having a good time at the internship ?"
"not too much busy work , i hope . ''"
"`` no , not at all , pierce ."
"it 's wonderful , thank you . ''"
"he nods ."
"`` well , i better get back to work ."
"you 'd think i 'd have gotten a lot done , considering how long i 've been in there , but i 've just been staring at the wall . ''"
"`` oh , well , i 'll see you tomorrow then . ''"
"`` 'night . ''"
"`` goodnight . ''"
"i walk back upstairs with the phone number burning a hole in my pocket ."
"it 's amazing to me that i 've gone from being almost sure that pierce is lying , to feeling like i 've betrayed his trust in the span of one short conversation with him ."
"is he telling the truth , or does he just possess a consummate politician 's ability to spin the story for himself ?"
"i get ready for bed slowly , my mind wandering uncontrollably ."
"before this summer , i felt sure of things in my life ."
"sure of my ideas and opinions ."
"sure that i was right ."
"but i feel less and less sure of myself the longer i stay in this house ."
"just as i finish brushing my teeth , i hear a thud from the hallway , then a groan ."
"that sounded like nate ."
"with a frown , i open my bedroom door ."
"sure enough , there 's nate , lying on the carpet just outside his own room ."
"i hesitate , realizing i 'm wearing my little nightgown , but figure he 's seen me in it already ."
"`` nate ?"
"are you ok ?"
"what happened ? ''"
"i murmur , hurrying to kneel next to him ."
"the whiff of alcohol coming off of him gives it away before he says anything ."
"`` i 'm so drunk , brynn , '' he says , beginning to laugh ."
"`` shhh , you 'll wake up our parents , '' i admonish him ."
"`` why are you on the floor ? ''"
"`` tripped ."
"on my own foot , '' he replies with a sigh ."
"`` well , come on , get up , '' i order him , sliding a hand under his torso to pull him upward ."
"he slowly obeys and stands on his feet , where he sways dangerously ."
"`` ok , now in here , '' i continue , pushing his bedroom door open with my foot as i slide an arm around his back to stabilize him ."
"i feel his muscles clench under his t-shirt as we walk ."
"not the time , brynn ."
"`` shoes off , '' i order him as we reach the bed ."
"`` mmm , '' he grunts , as he kicks them off ."
"`` i 'm getting you some water ."
"do n't move . ''"
"i hurry back to my bedroom and grab my water glass from the bedside table , then refill it from the tap in my bathroom before heading back to his room ."
"i shut the door behind me to keep the noise from filtering around the house , then stop in surprise as i see that nate has stripped down to his boxers and is standing at the foot of his bed ."
"`` thanks , '' he slurs , as i hesitantly walk forward and hand him the water ."
"i watch him gulp the whole glass down , the grey moonlight from the window illuminating his ripped torso ."
"he puts the glass down on his desk and wipes his mouth with the back of his hand as he sways slightly ."
"`` you alright ? ''"
"i ask worriedly ."
"`` i 've never seen you drunk before . ''"
"`` do n't really drink ."
"no time ."
"work , practice , work , game . ''"
"`` and i thought i was the nerd , '' i tease him ."
"`` you 're funny , '' he says , cocking his head slightly , then takes a step toward me ."
"`` nate ... '' i say as my core clenches ."
"`` yes , brynn ? ''"
"he asks innocently ."
"`` you said this was wrong ."
"those were your words , '' i remind him ."
"`` do you think it 's wrong ? ''"
"he takes another step toward me , and looks down at me ."
"`` i- '' his hand reaches around my waist ."
"`` does it feel wrong ? ''"
"`` yes ... no , '' i breathe ."
"i barely have time to inhale before his mouth is on mine ."
"his mouth tastes like whiskey , but i do n't care ."
"i wrap my hands around his neck and he grabs my ass with both hands , our kiss picking up right where our last one broke off ."
"i dig my fingers into his hair as our mouths open to one another ."
"he pulls me roughly against him and groans deep in his throat as our bodies collide ."
"suddenly he stumbles back , steadying himself on my shoulders ."
"`` sorry , '' he whispers , shaking his head as though to clear it ."
"`` will you just stay with me for a while ? ''"
"`` yes , of course , '' i reply immediately , even though i 'm taken aback by his request ."
"i watch him turn to his bed and crawl over to his pillow , then curl up on his side and look at me expectantly ."
"i pause , then follow him , crawling across the bedspread and curling around his back ."
"i bury my head between his shoulder blades then drape my arm over his waist , and feel him take my hand in his and pull me closer against him ."
"i lie as still as i can , barely breathing ."
"i ca n't believe he 's letting me touch him like this ."
"well , he is wasted , but still ."
"i never thought he 'd be so vulnerable around me ."
"i hear his breathing deepen ."
"`` i 've always looked up to him , '' he murmurs , startling me ."
"`` i know , '' i whisper back , knowing that he 's talking about his dad ."
"`` i do n't know what i would do if he- '' `` i know , '' i murmur , softly kissing the back of his neck ."
"he stills on his pillow , and his breathing slows down again ."
"i stay with him for a while , until i know he 's asleep ."
"i need to understand nate 's feelings about his mother before i tell him what she told me ."
"his world is already falling apart around him , and i do n't want to make it happen faster ."
"i sigh ."
"i should probably go back to my room ."
"i turn over with a sigh and frown ."
"my sheets feel different , and the light coming in from the window is much too bright ."
"i blink my eyes open and then sit up with a gasp ."
"i 'm in nate 's room ."
"`` it 's ok. '' i glance up to see nate sitting at his desk with a glass of water , his tousled hair sticking out at odd angles ."
"`` they left early this morning for meetings ."
"your door is closed , so they thought you were still asleep in there . ''"
"`` oh , good , '' i reply ."
"i realize my nightgown is riding dangerously high on my thigh and pull up the sheet self-consciously ."
"`` coffee , '' nate says , pointing to the bedside table next to me ."
"i glance over and see he 's placed a steaming cup there ."
"`` cream and one sugar , right ? ''"
"`` yeah , thanks , '' i reply , reaching for it ."
"`` sorry about last night ."
"i do n't remember anything after i got home . ''"
"i smile even though i 'm disappointed that he does n't remember the kiss ."
"`` you were drunk , and just asked me to stay here for a bit ."
"i did n't mean to fall asleep . ''"
"i glance at the clock ."
"`` shit , it 's almost eleven ?"
"i never sleep that late . ''"
"`` i did n't get up 'til nine-that 's late for me . ''"
"my mind quickly returns to my concerns from last night ."
"`` i-i know you do n't like to talk about this , but your mom- '' `` what about her ? ''"
"he says , already sounding defensive ."
"i need to tread carefully ."
"`` i know that it 's painful to talk about , i just wanted to know : why did she leave ? ''"
"nate crosses his arms over his chest ."
"`` eileen left because she could n't handle being a mother . ''"
"`` what do you mean ?"
"how so ? ''"
"`` i was out of control when i was a kid , and she could n't handle it ."
"could n't handle me . ''"
"`` that 's what your dad told you . ''"
"`` that 's what happened , '' nate replies , frowning at me ."
"`` i still remember the night she left ."
"they went out for dinner , and i stayed home with a babysitter ."
"one of many , because i kept driving them away , and i misbehaved again ."
"i threw a tantrum , broke a glass ... i 'm pretty sure the babysitter quit as soon as my parents got home ."
"anyway , they got in this big fight-i could hear it even in my bedroom-and the next day she left . ''"
"`` and you 've never seen her again ? ''"
"`` in court a couple times ."
"but after that , she was n't really interested in seeing me ."
"she tries to call here sometimes , maybe she feels guilty ."
"she always tries to blame my dad for what went down , '' he adds bitterly ."
"`` did you think that if ... if you had been better , she would n't have left ? ''"
"he shrugs ."
"`` does n't matter now ."
"why are you asking about this stuff ?"
"did i talk about it when i was drunk or something ? ''"
"`` no , no . ''"
"i put my coffee down on the nightstand ."
"`` she called here last night . ''"
"`` eileen ?"
"you talked to her ? ''"
"`` well , yeah , she was really upset . ''"
"`` fuck , brynn , '' he swears , standing up ."
"`` why would you do that ?"
"this has nothing to do with you . ''"
"`` i was just trying to help ... '' `` i do n't need your help , '' he spits at me ."
"`` would you just listen for a second ?"
"!"
"she called because she thought you might be willing to listen to her after what the woman said on the tv show- '' `` what are you talking about ? ''"
"he growls ."
"`` she said your dad was cheating on her , that 's why she left ."
"nothing to do with you . ''"
"`` get out , '' he says , raising his voice and pointing to the door ."
"`` nate , my dad left , too , ok ?"
"i know what it 's like ."
"but she sounded so lost , she 's desperate to talk to you ."
"i 'd kill for my dad to sound like that about me . ''"
"`` oh , so that 's what this is about , your daddy issues . ''"
"`` no !"
"that 's not what i meant , '' i plead , his words stinging to my core ."
"`` look , i 'm sorry that your dad is n't around , but your whole situation has nothing to do with mine ! ''"
"`` fine ! ''"
"i shout , feeling hurt ."
"i push off the sheets and stand up ."
"`` i promised her i 'd tell you , so i did ."
"i 'll never try to help you again . ''"
"`` that 's all i ask ! ''"
"he calls after me as i stomp out of his room ."
"i slam my bedroom door behind me , my fists balled in anger ."
"i walk straight to my bed and grab my pillow and swing it down as hard as i can onto the mattress ."
"i ."
"ca n't ."
"believe ."
"i ."
"ever ."
"had ."
"feelings ."
"for ."
"that ."
"asshole ."
"i think as i bring the pillow down again and again until i 'm out of breath ."
"it 's officially time for me to move on ."
"chapter fifteen `` you look nice , '' my mom says as i enter the kitchen , giving me a wink ."
"`` mom ... '' i reply , rolling my eyes ."
"`` well , you do !"
"where are you two going tonight ? ''"
"`` la mirabelle . ''"
"`` french-how romantic ! ''"
"`` it 's just a first date , ok ?"
"do n't get too excited . ''"
"i turn as nate and pierce enter from the dining room ."
"`` i just have a good feeling about this one , that 's all . ''"
"she continues , pouring me a glass of water , `` and he 's picking you up , right ? ''"
"`` oh , do you have a date tonight , brynn ? ''"
"pierce asks , wiggling his eyebrows at my mother ."
"`` yes , '' i groan , not wanting to make a big deal out of it ."
"`` greg !"
"the intern from your office , '' my mom tells him ."
"`` well , well ."
"you know , i remember seeing you two huddled together in the copy room last week , and thinking to myself , 'those two would make a fine couple . '"
"''"
"i blush as my mom smiles enthusiastically ."
"it 's amazing how quickly things have gotten back to normal after that woman went on tv ."
"for about a week , a handful of photographers waited around outside the gate , but they eventually left when the buzz died down ."
"pierce told us he has investigators working to discredit the woman 's claims , and that everything will be back to normal ."
"as for nate and me ... `` so it 'll just be the three of us for dinner then , '' my mom chirps ."
"`` two , actually ."
"i 'm going out tonight , as well , '' nate replies casually ."
"i manage to resist the urge to look at him ."
"`` oh ? ''"
"my mom asks ."
"`` nate , you should 've let holly know about your plans ."
"how many times have i had this conversation with you ?"
"responsibility , responsibility , responsibility , '' pierce says as he crosses to the fridge ."
"i glance at my mom , but she 's looking down at her chopping board ."
"`` sorry , holly , '' nate says dutifully ."
"`` it 's alright , really , '' my mom says quietly ."
"thankfully , the doorbell rings and i can excuse myself ."
"angry as i am at nate , i still do n't like to hear his dad speak to him in such a condescending way ."
"i walk down the hallway to the foyer , and hear my mom and pierce following me ."
"i wince ."
"i was hoping i 'd get out the door without them all meeting-wishful thinking , clearly ."
"i smile at greg as i open the door ."
"he 's wearing a navy blazer and khakis , and looks a little nervous ."
"`` hey , greg , '' i greet him ."
"`` greg !"
"it 's so nice to meet you , '' my mom says from behind me , forcing me to open the door all the way ."
"`` good to see you , '' pierce says , shaking his hand ."
"`` mr. thornhill , '' greg replies formally ."
"i see nate appear in the entrance to the living room , leaning casually on the doorjamb but saying nothing ."
"he smiles at me as i catch his eye ."
"i frown at him and look away ."
"`` have her home by ten , '' pierce instructs greg ."
"`` yes , sir , '' greg replies ."
"pierce slaps him on the back just as i 'm about to protest ."
"`` do n't worry , greg , i 'm just giving you a hard time . ''"
"`` oh , you had me for a second there , '' greg says , exhaling in relief ."
"`` well , we should get going , '' i cut in so that pierce does n't have the chance to make any more hilarious jokes ."
"`` see you later ! ''"
"i call , pulling the door closed behind me ."
"i just catch nate 's smirking expression before i shut the door ."
"`` you alright ? ''"
"greg asks as we walk to his car ."
"i force a smile and nod my head ."
"`` yes , sorry !"
"my mind wandered for a second ."
"so , have you ever been to this restaurant before ? ''"
"greg chose a very nice french restaurant for our date , it 's a cozy , softly lit place set in the hills of potomac ."
"the wait staff is clearly passionate about their food , and delighted to have a young couple on a date that they can fawn over ."
"`` so , how is it working for your stepdad ? ''"
"greg asks with a grin ."
"`` you know , it 's not that bad ."
"i hardly ever think twice about it , really ."
"he 's all the way at the top of the company , and i 'm all the way at the bottom , so we rarely interact on a day-to-day basis . ''"
"`` speaking of being at the bottom , roderick called me steven yesterday , '' greg says , referencing pierce 's business partner ."
"i laugh ."
"`` no !"
"is there even a steven working there ? ''"
"`` nope !"
"that 's the worst part ."
"who knows who he was thinking of ... '' he shakes his head remorsefully ."
"`` how come pierce 's son is n't working at thornhill and co. ?"
"did n't want to work with his dad ? ''"
"`` um , the opposite , actually ."
"pierce is pretty hard on nate ... i feel kind of guilty about the whole thing because i think nate wanted the internship , and then pierce offered it to me to punish him ."
"i tried not to accept , but pierce insisted , and we 'd just met , you know ?"
"i did n't want to be rude ."
"not to mention , my mom and pierce have n't known each other for very long , so i was a little taken aback by how quickly they 'd gotten married ... '' i bite my lip ."
"`` sorry , wow ."
"i 'm rambling . ''"
"`` it 's ok , i get it ."
"my parents are divorced , too . ''"
"`` well , mine are n't actually divorced ."
"they were n't married in the first place , '' i clarify ."
"but greg is n't listening-he 's squinting at the entrance to the restaurant ."
"`` speaking of ... is n't that nate now ?"
"did you tell him we were coming here ? ''"
"`` no , what ?"
"it ca n't be him , '' i reply , turning around to look ."
"but sure enough , there he is , with a brunette stunner on his arm ."
"that asshole !"
"there 's no way this is a coincidence-he must have overheard me telling my mom that greg was taking me here ."
"`` brynn ! ''"
"nate says with a smile , leading his date over as the hostess trails them ."
"`` i did n't know you guys were coming here too !"
"greg , right ?"
"i 'm nate . ''"
"`` good to meet you , '' greg says , shaking his outstretched hand ."
"`` and this is sophie , '' nate adds , indicating his date ."
"`` hey , '' she says , glancing up for a moment from the cellphone in her hands ."
"`` did you all want to sit together ? ''"
"the hostess asks ."
"`` we could pull another table over . ''"
"i could kill her ."
"`` what do you think ? ''"
"nate asks greg , his grin at full-wattage ."
"`` um , yeah , sure , why not ? ''"
"greg complies ."
"i quickly stand and make my way over to greg as a waiter helps the hostess pull another small table over ."
"i 'm not going to sit next to nate and risk a repeat of that thigh-touching incident ."
"`` i 'll let you two sit next to each other , '' i explain with a saccharine smile as i take a seat next to greg ."
"`` we just ordered so you 're not too far behind , '' greg says as the hostess hands nate and sophie menus ."
"`` could we get a bottle of dom for the table ? ''"
"nate asks the waiter , who nods happily and scurries off ."
"`` oh , you do n't have to- '' greg begins ."
"`` no , i insist ."
"we 're interrupting your date here , '' nate replies magnanimously ."
"`` i love champagne , '' sophie pipes up , finally putting her phone away ."
"i narrow my eyes at nate and he studiously avoids my gaze ."
"`` so , what were you two lovebirds talking about before we got here ? ''"
"nate asks greg ."
"`` nothing , really , '' greg replies glancing at me ."
"`` you know , with your light hair , you two could almost be related ."
"cousins , maybe , '' nate observes , leaning back in his chair ."
"i swiftly kick his shin under the table ."
"i see his jaw tighten but he does n't even make a sound ."
"`` oh my god , totally ! ''"
"sophie agrees ."
"`` i made out with my cousin once , but i did n't know he was my cousin at the time ."
"but then it happened again ... '' i glare at nate as sophie launches into her story , and he smiles back at me ."
"it 's going to be a long night ."
"chapter sixteen i spin around in nate 's desk chair as he shuts his bedroom door behind him ."
"i 've been waiting here , fuming , ever since greg dropped me off twenty minutes ago ."
"`` jesus !"
"what are you , a bond villain ? ''"
"he asks , genuinely startled ."
"`` what were you thinking ?"
"!"
"i know you did that on purpose to ruin my date , you fucker ! ''"
"nate shrugs ."
"`` come on , you really going to tell me you were having a great time before i got there ? ''"
"`` oh , so you were just helping me out , is that it ?"
"greg was completely weirded out by the whole thing . ''"
"`` sophie had a nice time . ''"
"`` sophie , please !"
"where 'd you find her ?"
"a high school dance ? ''"
"`` i like her , '' he says with a smug grin as he sits on his bed ."
"`` oh , really ?"
"so why are n't you with her right now ?"
"could n't seal the deal ? ''"
"his smile falters a bit ."
"`` maybe i did n't feel like it . ''"
"`` well , i guess there 's a first time for everything ."
"just stay out of my life , ok ? ''"
"i say , and stalk toward the door ."
"`` i 'll stay out of yours if you stay out of mine , '' he counters ."
"i turn to face him , `` is that what this is about ?"
"you 're mad because i told you your mom called , so you try to ruin my date ? ''"
"i hold out my hands in surrender ."
"`` no , it was n't that . ''"
"`` then what ?"
"i do n't have time to play games with a crazy man-child . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry , alright ?"
"i just did n't like seeing you with that guy ... something about his face is just , so punch-able , '' he says , standing up and walking over to me ."
"`` why ?"
"this is the second time you 've come between me and a guy . ''"
"i hold up a hand to stop him from protesting ."
"`` and yeah , i know , jackson was n't a good choice , but that 's not the case with greg , ok ?"
"he 's a nice guy ."
"so tell me , why do you care ? ''"
"i challenge him as he looks down at me ."
"there 's a long pause as his pupils dilate , i can practically feel him struggling with the truth , but i refuse to move until he admits it ."
"`` you know why , '' he says , looking me in the eye , his voice low and husky ."
"before i know what 's happening , his arms are around me , pulling me against him ."
"his urgency takes my breath away-his fingers reach desperately under my shirt , grabbing at my bra strap and expertly undoing the clasps ."
"his mouth devours mine as he reaches back around my waist and picks me up effortlessly , bringing me over to his bed ."
"as nate puts me down , i realize my bra is hanging free in the back , and he breaks away from our kiss to rip off my top ."
"he pauses to look down at my breasts curving out of my limp bra before diving into my neck ."
"`` oh god , brynn , i have to have you , '' he groans ."
"i gasp as he sinks his teeth into my skin and then flicks his tongue across my taut neck muscles on his way up to my ear ."
"my knees buckle as his tongue presses into my ear , and i grab onto his neck for support ."
"my mind ca n't keep up with what 's happening , all my thoughts are a blur , but my body is urging me on , desperately ."
"as he sucks on my earlobe , i slide my hands down and under his shirt , finally feeling the body i 've coveted for so long ."
"his abs are even harder than i thought they would be , and they flex under my soft fingertips ."
"i keep sliding my hands upward , feeling his nipples harden under my palms , and i feel the growing bulge of his cock pressing against my thigh ..."
"i turn nate thornhill on ."
"holy fuck ."
"the thought drives me crazy and i feel myself instantly become moist with wanting , my body overcome with illicit , sinful lust ."
"no man has ever made me feel this way before ."
"he steps back for a moment and pulls off his shirt , tossing it carelessly on the ground , revealing his incredible body for all its glory ."
"thousands of hours spent at the gym on and on the field have painstakingly sculpted his muscles into a fucking masterpiece for womankind ."
"he slowly reaches forward and takes my bra straps under his expert fingers , pulling them off my arms and tossing my bra onto the pile of clothes on the floor ."
"i shiver involuntarily as he looks down my exposed body , exhaling softly out of his mouth ."
"he sinks to his knees in front of me and leans forward , kissing me gently on my stomach ."
"i place my hands on his shoulders as he moves up , running his tongue underneath the crease of my breasts ."
"i cry out as he takes my right breast into his mouth , sucking hard on my nipple ."
"he brings one hand up to massage my left breast , and i dip my head back , feeling pleasure swell in my body like i never have before ."
"i feel his fingers hook over the top of my skirt and slowly pull it down as his mouth moves to my left breast , softly biting it before flicking his tongue back and forth across my areola ."
"i hear my skirt fall to the floor and his hands glide up my legs from my knees , his thumbs hooking around my inner thigh ."
"he dips his head and kisses me softly just above the top of my white cotton underwear ."
"`` i 've been dreaming about how sweet you taste , '' he murmurs , almost inaudibly ."
"he pulls my panties down just a bit and runs his tongue over the now exposed skin ."
"i begin to shake , a mixture of unbridled desire and nerves , as he slides my underwear down to my ankles ."
"i feel his warm breath on my skin , just a moment before his mouth is on me , kissing and licking my most intimate of places ."
"i moan involuntarily at the sensation ... it 's completely new to me , and it feels better than i ever could have imagined ."
"he flicks his tongue across my aching clit , sending jolts of rapture through every inch of me ."
"with one hand i tighten my grip on his strong shoulders , digging my fingers into his hair with the other , and letting my head dip back in utter bliss as he licks my pussy with slow , strong strokes ."
"`` oh my god , nate ... '' i hear myself moan from far away as i 'm carried off by wave after wave of pleasure ."
"before i know what 's happening , my body spasms , and i feel nate grab my ass to keep me upright and pressed against his skillful mouth ."
"as i begin to come down , i feel his licks becoming gentler ."
"he reaches up and puts his finger to my lips , and i instinctively take it into my mouth , licking and sucking his finger , thinking about how incredible it would feel to do this to another part of him ..."
"he pulls his finger out of my mouth and slips it carefully inside my tight pussy ."
"he circles it around slowly , and i can hear him grunt in satisfaction at my wetness ."
"my eyes begin to open slowly and i glance down at him ."
"he catches my eye and stands up , dipping his head down and catching me in a kiss , his finger still inside me ."
"my eyes widen as i taste myself on his lips and he pushes his tongue inside me with abandon ."
"`` i 'm going to make you feel so fucking good , '' he promises with a wicked smile , undoing his belt buckle and unzipping his pants in one fluid motion before pushing them and his boxers to the ground ."
"i gape at his massive cock as it 's unsheathed from his underwear ."
"its size snaps me back to the reality of what 's about to happen , and i feel overcome with fear and adrenalin ... but i ca n't take my eyes off it ."
"i want to feel him inside of me so much , but i think there 's one thing i need to tell him first ."
"he bites his lip and moves against me again ."
"i can feel his cock , throbbing and ready , against my stomach ."
"he wraps his arms around me , and eases me back onto the bed and lays on top of me , kissing my neck ."
"`` nate ... i ... i have to tell you ... '' i murmur , his mouth a complete distraction ."
"`` mmm , whatever it is , it does n't matter now , '' he replies , biting my earlobe ."
"`` it might , though ."
"i just thought i should tell you , or warn you maybe , in case i 'm not very good- '' `` i doubt that- '' `` i 'm a virgin . ''"
"i feel his body stiffen as the words cross my lips ."
"he pulls back and looks me in the eye ."
"`` what ?"
"no ."
"no way . ''"
"i nod ."
"`` but it 's ok ."
"i want to do this . ''"
"`` how ... how are you a virgin ? ''"
"oh , dear ."
"this is not the kind of conversation i want to have right now ."
"`` i do n't know , i just am ."
"it just has n't happened yet , but i 'm ready now . ''"
"i assure him ."
"`` but you 've ... you must have done some things ... '' he begins worriedly ."
"`` yeah , sure , you know , kissing ... '' `` and ?"
"wait , was that the first time anyone 's ever gone down on you ? ''"
"i can only shrug ."
"`` i did n't think it would be that big of a deal ."
"i just was telling you , in case i 'm not that good , or if i bleed or something . ''"
"he rolls off of me and sits up ."
"shit ."
"`` brynn , it is a big deal , it 's a very big deal to me . ''"
"`` i do n't understand ... '' i reply , sitting up and pulling the sheet over to cover me , suddenly feeling very self-conscious ."
"`` it 's just , your first time ... it 's going to mean a lot to you . ''"
"`` so ? ''"
"i say , confused ."
"he spreads his hands open on his legs but does n't say anything ."
"i feel a sensation like a rock sinking to the bottom of my stomach ."
"`` oh ... you 're saying it will mean a lot to me , but it wo n't mean a lot to you . ''"
"i stare straight forward as he turns to me ."
"`` brynn , you 're smart , gorgeous , funny , ambitious ... you 're wonderful ... but like i told you before , i do n't lie to women and say that i 'm interested in something more when i 'm not . ''"
"`` i guess i forgot about your policy , '' i reply flatly , feeling like the biggest idiot in the world ."
"the biggest naked idiot in the world ."
"`` could you ... could you close your eyes ? ''"
"`` brynn , i 've seen- '' `` just close them , ok ? ''"
"i glance at him to make sure he 's complied , and then stand up and begin to gather my clothes from the floor ."
"i slip everything back on as quickly as i can , and then look back at him ."
"his eyes are closed , and he 's sitting nude and perfectly still on the edge of the bed ."
"he looks as perfect as i 've ever seen him look , which is really saying something ."
"my heart breaks a little , as i move to the door and shut it behind me ."
"i hurry down the hall and into my own bedroom , which now feels cold and empty ."
"i crawl into bed without bothering to take off my clothes and pull the covers over me ."
"i 'm no different to nate thornhill than any of the other girls he 's been with , and i should have known that ."
"stupid , stupid , stupid ."
"i hear a soft knock at the door and pull the covers up a little higher , but do n't answer ."
"if it 's my mom , i do n't want to see her , and if it 's nate , i really do n't want to see him ."
"there 's another knock , a little louder , and then the door is slowly pushed open ."
"i can just see nate 's shadow in the moonlight ."
"he closes the door behind him and moves into the room ."
"to my surprise , he walks around the foot of my bed and to the other side , then hops on , lying down over the covers next to me ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he whispers , laying his hands over his stomach ."
"`` you do n't have to apologize ."
"you were just being honest . ''"
"`` no , i think i do ."
"and i 'll stop interfering with you and other guys . ''"
"i clear my throat to keep the pain down ."
"`` good . ''"
"`` i do n't really have female friends ... '' he says ."
"`` dana ? ''"
"`` dana and i are , well , fuck buddies , mostly ."
"and that 's what she wants , too , so it 's ok. '' `` mmm . ''"
"`` but i 'd ... i 'd like us to be friends . ''"
"`` we 're already step-siblings , '' i point out ."
"i can hear him smile next to me ."
"`` true ."
"but that was n't by choice . ''"
"he pauses ."
"`` i like you ."
"i ca n't deny that i 'm attracted to you , of course , but i 'm just not the relationship kind of guy ."
"not to mention the kind of issues that dating my own stepsister would bring up . ''"
"he sighs ."
"`` so can we be friends ? ''"
"i consider for a moment ."
"if i 'm nate 's only female friend , then i really am different to him ."
"maybe not in the way i 'd most like , but still , it 's something ."
"`` ok. friends , then ."
"wait , actually , '' i turn onto my side and face him ."
"`` before we 're officially friends , i have to ask you some non-friend questions . ''"
"`` ok ... '' he replies warily , turning on his side , too ."
"`` was i ... am i ... ok at all that stuff ?"
"you know ... '' he laughs ."
"`` what we just did , you mean ?"
"yes ."
"you are more than ok at it . ''"
"i smile ."
"`` when did you lose your virginity ? ''"
"`` when i was fourteen . ''"
"`` wow . ''"
"`` she was my friend 's older sister . ''"
"`` wow . ''"
"`` how many women have you slept with ? ''"
"`` oh my god , i do n't even know ... '' `` wait , really ?"
"you do n't even know ? ''"
"`` i mean , dozens ?"
"i do n't count . ''"
"`` sheesh ."
"ok , one more : why are n't you the relationship kind of guy ? ''"
"he pauses ."
"`` i do n't know , '' he says softly ."
"`` i tried a couple times , but that kind of closeness , it just makes me uncomfortable ."
"that 's all i know . ''"
"i nod , sensing he 's telling me everything he can , and roll back over onto my back ."
"i like the feeling of lying here with him next to me ."
"i feel much more comfortable than i would have thought possible ."
"i feel my eyes beginning to flutter closed as sleep pulls me under ."
"`` brynn ... i ... ''"
"i can just hear nate say ."
"`` you 're going to make some man very happy one day . ''"
"chapter seventeen `` i 'm just glad the whole thing has blown over , '' greg says as we pull off the beltway ."
"i nod as i look out at the trees whizzing by in the dark ."
"the woman who accused pierce of sexual harassment rescinded her claims after it turned out she had accused two other former bosses of the same thing ."
"`` it just feels like there 's been a shadow over the office for the last month . ''"
"`` yeah , '' i reply noncommittally ."
"greg clears his throat as we near my house ."
"`` so , i 'm glad we got the chance to go out again , '' he says ."
"`` me too , '' i reply with a smile ."
"this is our third date , and he still has n't tried anything ."
"i 'm wondering if tonight will be the night ."
"a nervous silence falls over the car as we pull through the gates and onto the driveway ."
"he stops in front of the house and then turns to me ."
"`` why do n't i walk you to your door , '' he suggests ."
"`` sure . ''"
"a few butterflies begin to fly around in my stomach ."
"we undo our seat belts and hop out , meeting around the front of the car and walking up to the front door ."
"i glance at him out of the corner of my eye and wish there were something calming i could say to him , because he looks way more nervous than i do ."
"we reach the door and turn to each other ."
"`` well , goodnight , '' he says ."
"`` goodnight . ''"
"he pauses , looking into my eyes , and then begins to move forward ."
"i lean in , and close my eyes ."
"his lips touch mine and i frown slightly ."
"i mean , there 's nothing wrong with his lips or anything , but i thought i 'd feel ... more ."
"he keeps his mouth chastely pressed against mine for a few seconds and then pulls back and smiles at me ."
"`` goodnight , brynn , '' he says again ."
"`` goodnight , '' i reply , and turn to go inside ."
"i shut the door behind me , and lean back against it , disappointed ."
"greg and i get along well , and he 's such a nice guy-i 'd hoped i would eventually develop romantic feelings for him ... but that kiss ... was not so good ."
"i sigh and continue through the foyer and into the kitchen ."
"`` hey , '' nate greets me ."
"i stop as a buzz runs through me at just the sight of him ."
"that 's the feeling i ca n't manufacture when i 'm with greg ."
"`` hey ."
"you go for a run ? ''"
"i ask , taking in his sweaty appearance ."
"`` yeah , well , just on the treadmill ."
"too dark for a trail run ."
"did you ... did you have a nice time tonight ? ''"
"i glance over at him ."
"he gulps a long sip from a gatorade bottle and then puts it down on the counter ."
"`` um , yeah , it was good , '' i reply ."
"`` i was just going to watch a movie in the den if you 're interested . ''"
"`` fine , but i choose tonight , '' i reply with a smile ."
"we 've both committed to this whole being friends thing , though at times i feel like i 'm going through the motions ."
"i do n't know if i 'll ever be able to turn off the part of me that will always want more from him ."
"`` no romantic comedies , '' he says , as he walks to the door of the kitchen ."
"`` i 'm just going to hop in the shower really fast . ''"
"the phone on the counter rings and he steps toward it , but it only rings once ."
"we both look toward pierce 's study as raised voices emanate from that direction ."
"a moment later , we hear stomping coming our way and frown at each other in concern ."
"pierce storms in and walks to the fridge ."
"`` reporter ? ''"
"nate asks quietly ."
"`` your mother , '' pierce replies , equally quietly , though there 's a hint of venom in his voice ."
"my eyes flick over to nate ."
"i hope i have n't made the situation worse by taking her call that one time ."
"he meets my gaze and shakes his head quickly as though to warn me not to say anything ."
"`` i do n't know how she got this new number-it 's unlisted ."
"that bitch just wo n't give up . ''"
"my mouth drops open at pierce 's language ."
"i 've never even heard him swear before , and it 's so at odds with his genteel appearance that it sounds even more shocking coming out of his mouth ."
"`` we 're going to go watch a movie , '' i murmur , wanting to get away from him when he 's in this kind of mood ."
"i can feel the waves of anger coming off of him ."
"but pierce swings around to face nate , the gatorade bottle in his hand ."
"`` how many fucking times have i told you to clean up after yourself ? ''"
"he growls , and i shrink back ."
"`` i was n't done drinking- '' nate begins ."
"`` do n't interrupt me !"
"you think the rest of the world is just here to serve you ?"
"that everyone else exists to make your cushy life a little easier ?"
"you 've never had to work for anything in your life ."
"it 's pathetic , '' pierce spits at his son ."
"i remain frozen on the other side of the counter , feeling like a coward , and not knowing what i should say ."
"i see color rise in nate 's cheeks , but all he says is , `` yes , sir . ''"
"with that , pierce slams the bottle back on the counter and walks back toward his office without even looking at me ."
"nate remains motionless for a moment , then walks over to the bottle , drinks the rest of it , and tosses it into the recycling ."
"`` i 'm sorry , you did n't deserve- '' i start , feeling horrified by the scene i just witnessed ."
"`` you still want to watch that movie ? ''"
"nate asks , tilting his head toward me but not making eye contact ."
"`` yes , '' i whisper back , unsure of what else to do or say ."
"`` ok , meet you in there in ten minutes , '' nate says simply and walks out ."
"i wait until i can hear him walking up the stairs before i move ."
"i 've never heard a father talk to his son like that before , and our old neighborhood was n't exactly full of model families ."
"and the way nate 's shoulders slumped as pierce was speaking to him , it was like he agreed with what his father was saying about him ."
"i walk up the stairs to my room and change into my sweats , before heading back downstairs to make some popcorn-food always makes me feel better ."
"as soon as it 's finished popping , i head into the den to wait for nate ."
"should i tell my mom about what pierce just did ?"
"would she even listen ?"
"she seems to have drunk the pierce kool-aid pretty heavily by this point ."
"and now that pierce has been the victim of false allegations , it will be even harder for her to believe anything bad about him ."
"i glance up , frowning , as nate walks in and sits down on the couch next to me ."
"`` i can tell by that expression on your face that you want to talk , '' he begins ."
"i smile slightly , he knows me well ."
"`` but the stuff with my parents-it 's off-limits , ok ? ''"
"but i need to tell him that those things pierce said are n't true ."
"`` just- '' `` no , brynn ."
"i really want us to be able to keep hanging out ."
"but if you keep bringing it up ... '' i sigh ."
"`` fine ."
"i wo n't say anything ."
"in exchange , though ... '' i walk to the wide bookcases full of dvd options ."
"`` no romantic comedies ! ''"
"`` big fish , '' i say , pulling out the case ."
"`` is that a romantic comedy ? ''"
"he asks , narrowing his eyes suspiciously ."
"`` well , not really ."
"there is romance in it , but it 's more about a family , '' i explain , careful not to mention the predominant father-son themes ."
"`` hey , friendships have to have some compromise , '' i add with a smile ."
"`` ok , fine , '' he says , rolling his eyes ."
"he takes a handful of popcorn and leans against one end of the couch as i pop the dvd in ."
"as i make myself comfortable on the other end , he pulls a blanket from the back of the couch and arranges it over my feet , because he knows that they get cold ."
"i feel a pang in my chest at the small gesture , but try to push it away ."
"he 's not being romantic , just thoughtful ."
"i look up at the large tv screen as the picture comes up ."
"i feel more comfortable around nate than i do with anyone else in my life right now , so i have to settle for being friends with him ."
"otherwise i could lose him altogether ."
"chapter eighteen `` you and nate head down there so we do n't lose the reservation ! ''"
"my mom instructs me ."
"she planned a family outing to go rafting on the potomac , but pierce is stuck at the office in meetings , even though it 's a saturday ."
"`` i 'll swing by and get him and meet you there . ''"
"`` you sure ? ''"
"`` yeah , he said he 'd only be a little longer , '' she assures me ."
"`` ok , '' i reply with a shrug , and walk into the anteroom off the kitchen where nate is slipping on his sneakers ."
"`` my mom says they 're going to meet us there , '' i tell him ."
"`` fuck it , let 's make tracks , sis . ''"
"he smirks ."
"and off we go in his wrangler , nate blasting some god-awful metal music ."
"`` how do you listen to this shit ?"
"it sounds like two cat 's screwing in a trashcan . ''"
"i shake my head ."
"`` what ?"
"this is slayer , they 're classic trash metal , you have to have respect . ''"
"he says reverently ."
"`` i always listen to reign in blood before all of my games . ''"
"`` lovely . ''"
"i screw my face up in mock horror ."
"he turns it up louder , nodding his head enthusiastically as the guitar riffs collide into what i assume is his favorite part of the song ."
"it 's strange to see him let loose like this , and even though i think his taste in music is horrifying , i have to admit i like to see him enjoying himself ."
"thankfully , the boathouse is just a little ways down the potomac in the direction of the city , and i 'm only subjected to slayer for a few more minutes ."
"the temperature on this august day is in the mid-nineties , but my mom was insistent upon doing a family activity outdoors ."
"as we take a left on the dirt road with an old sign pointing the way , i spot an empty parking lot , and figure most people are wisely staying inside with their air-conditioning today ."
"after we park , nate heads over to the wood-slatted structure to secure the boat , and i take the sunscreen out of my bag ."
"as nate walks back over , he smiles as he sees me struggling to smear it in between the straps of my sports bra ."
"`` want some help ? '"
"he asks ."
"`` ... sure , '' i reply , though i 'm anything but ."
"the idea of nate 's hands on me , when i know nothing else is going to happen , sounds like torture ."
"i might actually prefer getting a first-degree sunburn , but he 's already taken the bottle from me and squeezing some of it out into his palm ."
"`` um , just pull the back of your shirt up , '' he instructs me ."
"i do as he says , pulling it up to my hairline ."
"i feel his greased-up hands slipping under the straps of my bra , and am glad he ca n't see the blush that immediately spreads across my face ."
"i take a deep breath , trying to keep my raging hormones at bay , as his fingers slide around the side of my ribcage ."
"`` now you do me , '' he says , as i release my shirt ."
"`` that 's what she said , '' i mutter ."
"`` ha ! ''"
"nate barks , a short , joyful shout of laughter ."
"`` i did n't know you were funny brynn , '' he says , grinning wide at me ."
"`` there 's a lot you do n't know about me . ''"
"i say , daring to meet his gaze for a brief moment ."
"i clear my throat and take the bottle of sunscreen from him , willing myself to keep my thoughts clean ."
"he pauses , then turns around and pulls off his shirt ."
"i groan inwardly at the sight of his wide , muscular back ."
"where are our parents ?"
"i need some kind of buffer between us ."
"but there are no signs of any cars pulling into the parking lot anytime soon , so i dutifully squeeze some lotion onto my fingers and then begin to spread it across his back ."
"i carefully press it all the way up to his neck , across his shoulder blades-feeling the sinewy ropes of muscle there , down his back , and finally down to the top of his athletic shorts , my fingers venturing just inside his waistband ."
"i hear him suck in a small bit of air , and see the slight throbbing of his member in his shorts ."
"he 's trying hard to hold back , i can tell ."
"`` ok , all done ! ''"
"i say overly cheerily , as i hand him the bottle ."
"nate tosses his shirt into the back of his jeep and begins to spread sunscreen across his chest ."
"i keep my eyes trained on the hazy river ."
"`` they say how long they were going to be ? ''"
"`` nope , my mom just said- '' i break off as i hear my phone start to ring in my purse on the front seat ."
"`` i bet that 's her now ."
"hey , mom , '' i greet her as i accept the call ."
"`` hey , honey . ''"
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"i ask , immediately hearing stress in her voice ."
"`` oh , it 's nothing , but pierce wo n't be able to get out of the office long enough to go kayaking today ."
"i 'm just going to drive down to the office now , so at least he and i can have lunch together . ''"
"`` ok , should we- '' `` no , you two go kayaking and have fun , alright ?"
"we 'll see you tonight for dinner . ''"
"`` oh , alright , if you 're sure , '' i reply , wincing as i catch nate watching me , his muscular torso gleaming in the sun ."
"`` your dad got caught up in work stuff , and my mom 's going to go meet him at the office for lunch , so they 're not coming ."
"they said we should still go if we want , '' i explain as i hang up ."
"`` since we 're here , '' nate says with a shrug ."
"`` you ever been kayaking here before ? ''"
"`` never been kayaking at all . ''"
"`` well , you 'll love it , '' he replies , locking up his car ."
"`` says the captain of the uva crew team . ''"
"i smile ."
"in short order , we 're pushing off the dock in a tandem kayak ."
"with nate 's powerful oar strokes , we quickly clear the shallow , muddy water and head toward the open water ."
"`` you 'll get the hang of it , '' nate encourages me , and i turn around to smile sheepishly at him ."
"`` i think i 'm just holding you back , here , '' i laugh , trying to get the feeling of how to dip the oar in the water at the right time ."
"`` well , i have a lot more experience than you in a boat , '' he says ."
"`` we used to train for crew on the potomac in high school , but we were a lot closer in to the city ."
"we 'd pass georgetown , the kennedy center ... you 'd be amazed at the wildlife you can see out here , though , '' he tells me as he steers us upriver and into the current ."
"`` i feel so far away from everything , '' i observe as the sounds of traffic are quickly covered up by the trees rising on either side of us ."
"`` this land used to belong to a native american tribe called the- '' `` piscataway , '' i finish reflexively ."
"`` damn , i keep forgetting my stepsister is a nerd , '' he says , and i can hear from his voice that he 's grinning ."
"`` i wo n't even try to impress you with my passion for local history , then . ''"
"`` no , come on , impress me , '' i tease him ."
"`` i ca n't hold a candle , '' he feigns defeat ."
"`` you get better grades than me . ''"
"`` yeah , well , put me on two varsity teams and i think those grades might dip a little ."
"i do n't know how you do it ."
"my friends allison and miriam tell me i spend too much time at the library-i barely have enough time for them ."
"not to mention , i 'm not athletically gifted at all , '' i add , nodding to my ineffectual rowing ."
"`` so you 've got me there . ''"
"`` i met allison on the 4th , right ? ''"
"`` right . ''"
"`` but miriam ? ''"
"`` she 's back home in memphis for the summer ."
"she 's my other good friend ; she and allison room together . ''"
"`` why do n't you live with them ? ''"
"he asks , and i pause to listen to his oars dropping quietly into the water ."
"`` mm , i thought about it , but i like living alone ."
"my mom can be ... '' `` what ? ''"
"he prods me ."
"`` i 'm trying to think of a more flattering word for needy . ''"
"`` you can say needy if you want ."
"i wo n't tell . ''"
"`` ok , she 's really fucking needy , '' i reply , feeling like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders ."
"i hardly ever talk about the more negative aspects of my relationship with my mom ."
"`` honestly , a lot less so since she 's met pierce , though ."
"sometimes i just feel like i'm- '' `` her mom , '' he finishes for me ."
"i turn to face him , raising my eyebrows ."
"`` is it obvious ? ''"
"i ask worriedly ."
"`` i do n't mean to sound resentful . ''"
"`` you 're allowed to feel however you want about her , '' he responds with a kind smile , and i turn back around ."
"`` at first i thought you were fragile , '' he says after a moment ."
"`` like if i dropped you , you 'd break ."
"i think that 's why ... that 's why i wanted to test you a little . ''"
"`` you mean when you felt me up at dinner with our parents sitting across from us ? ''"
"he laughs ."
"`` i ca n't believe i did that , and i do n't think i 've ever apologized . ''"
"`` no , you did n't , jerk . ''"
"`` i am sorry . ''"
"`` so , you do n't think i 'm fragile now ? ''"
"`` no ."
"i think you 're one of the toughest people i 've ever met ."
"look ! ''"
"he says suddenly ."
"i glance back toward him and follow where 's he 's pointing ."
"`` a great blue heron , '' he explains as i spot the huge bird with its wings spread , perched on a rock in the middle of the river ."
"`` that 's how they dry their feathers after they dive for fish . ''"
"he stops rowing for a while as we watch it ."
"suddenly it pulls its wings in , gathers itself like a coil , and launches into the air ."
"we watch it fly into the distant treetops before we begin paddling up the river again ."
"`` why are you interested in history ? ''"
"i ask him ."
"`` i like understanding why people behave the way they do , '' he explains quietly ."
"i resist the urge to ask how this relates to his own history , trying to respect the boundaries he 's put up ."
"`` how 's greg ? ''"
"he asks suddenly ."
"i turn around and narrow my eyes at him ."
"`` what ?"
"that 's a friendly question , '' he says with a devilish grin ."
"`` i ... i do n't want to talk about it , '' i reply , a little more huffily than i intend to ."
"`` ok ... so that either means really good or really bad . ''"
"`` it 's not really bad , '' i protest ."
"`` uh-oh . ''"
"i sigh ."
"`` it 's just , there 's no ... you know ... '' `` spark ? ''"
"`` exactly ."
"i have to tell him soon-i do n't want him to get hurt ."
"not that i think i 'm breaking his heart or anything- '' `` i saw the way he looks at you . ''"
"`` meaning ? ''"
"`` he 's falling fast ."
"i 'd tell him before he falls any further . ''"
"`` i think you 're exaggerating . ''"
"`` trust me . ''"
"we fall back into a comfortable silence as i think about his words ."
"the stillness of the river , broken only by a soft wind blowing through the trees , helps to ease my anxiety over the conversation i need to have with greg ."
"the concept of `` problems '' seems to fade out here , though perhaps it 's the unrelenting heat , which feels like it 's beginning to melt my body into the seat of the kayak ."
"i grab the sweating bottle of water from between my feet and take a long swig ."
"`` water ? ''"
"i ask nate , turning to offer it to him ."
"he takes it , brushing my fingers with his as he wraps his long fingers around it ."
"my insides clench ... speaking of a spark ."
"i spot a house very much like ours up on a hillside in the distance ."
"`` where 'd you live before the house now ? ''"
"`` townhouse in georgetown . ''"
"he says ."
"`` it was less of a behemoth ."
"had more character . ''"
"`` the mansion is n't your taste ? ''"
"`` it was always big for two people , and it still seems big , even for four ."
"but what i really do n't like is that it 's got all these fake historical touches about it , and none of them are genuine . ''"
"`` anathema to a history major . ''"
"`` exactly ."
"i always pictured myself in a smaller house , maybe a converted barn or something ... one that was actually built in the time period it looks like it was built in ."
"maybe somewhere quieter than dc ... it 's pretty elitist here ... i want my kids to grow up more modestly than i did . ''"
"`` you want kids ? ''"
"i ask , surprised ."
"`` you do n't ? ''"
"`` no , i do ... i 'm just surprised ."
"you know that having kids might necessitate being in a relationship with a woman for longer than you 're used to . ''"
"he laughs ."
"`` i honestly had n't thought of that ."
"i always just pictured myself with kids ."
"is that horrible ? ''"
"`` yes ! ''"
"i reply , quickly reaching down and flinging water back at him ."
"`` hey ! ''"
"he cries , and grabs the sides of the kayak , beginning to rock it back and forth ."
"`` i 'll tip this thing over , '' he warns me with a grin ."
"`` nate ! ''"
"i protest , grabbing on ."
"he relents , and keeps rowing after a moment ."
"`` i think your mom picked the hottest day of the year , '' he observes ."
"`` want to head back ? ''"
"i ask , hoping he 'll say no ."
"he pauses ."
"`` guess we should . ''"
"i nod , feeling disappointed , and dip my oar in the water to help him turn the kayak ."
"now that we 're going with the current , it takes us much less time to make the return trip back to the boat house ."
"`` how 's your shoulder ? ''"
"i ask ."
"`` it 's better , actually , '' he says happily , `` thanks for asking . ''"
"i feel a tightening in my throat as we pull into the shallower water ."
"nate steps onto the dock first , then offers me his hand to help me get out of the unsteady boat ."
"`` much shadier under the trees , '' he observes , nodding to a hiking trail that cuts through the trees behind the boat house ."
"i look at him questioningly ."
"`` short hike before we go back ? ''"
"i nod and smile , trying not to look too pleased ."
"chapter nineteen `` you 've got good stamina for someone who does n't do sports , '' nate observes as our `` short hike '' goes into its second hour ."
"`` i 've been swimming in the pool pretty frequently , maybe that 's it , '' i reply , though really i think it 's that the conversation has n't stopped ."
"we 're high over the potomac now , on a dirt trail that winds around large boulders ."
"he was right-it is cooler under the trees , but it 's still just as humid ."
"`` is that it ? ''"
"i ask , pointing to a three-leaved plant at the base of a tree ."
"after telling nate that i manage to get poison ivy every other year , he 's made it his mission to teach me how to identify the rash-causing the plant ."
"`` not red enough ."
"by this time of the summer , it 'll be more red and oily-looking ."
"and the edges of the leaves are too jagged , '' he says as he bends over to look at it ."
"a pair of female hikers approach us on the trail , headed the opposite direction ."
"i watch them drink in nate 's shirtless , sweaty appearance and giggle to each other ."
"as they pass , they smile flirtatiously at him , but he just politely smiles back before turning to me ."
"`` you 're good at so many things , but identifying plant species ... '' he intones in a mock-serious voice as he shakes his head ."
"`` hey , if that 's my weakness , i 'll take it , '' i reply with a grin ."
"`` yep , poison ivy , that 's your kryptonite , '' he teases me ."
"`` what 's yours ?"
"intimacy ? ''"
"`` intimacy ?"
"how dare you !"
"it 's commitment ."
"very different . ''"
"`` oh , duh , of course ."
"my apologies , '' i reply , glad we can joke about this kind of thing ."
"`` wait , there ! ''"
"i say , pointing to an ivy crawling up a tree trunk on the river side of the trail ."
"`` where ?"
"i do n't see it , '' nate replies , craning his neck ."
"`` there ! ''"
"i repeat , walking off the trail and into the underbrush ."
"`` brynn , be careful !"
"and i do n't think that 's poison ivy , anyway . ''"
"`` no , really !"
"see , it 's red- '' i break off as i feel the ground beneath me give way ."
"what i thought was solid earth was just an overhang of vegetation ."
"my stomach flies into my throat as i begin to fall , the horizon instantly becoming a blur ."
"i gasp and turn , frantically grabbing onto the dirt and branches nearby ."
"`` brynn ! ''"
"nate yells , and dives into the brush after me ."
"i feel him grab my hand as i struggle to find a foothold on the steep hill beneath me ."
"my feet frantically search for support and i begin to panic ."
"`` it 's ok , it 's ok , i 've got you , '' nate says ."
"the steadiness in his voice causes me to look up at him ."
"he 's looking back down at me , his eyes sure and calm ."
"i take a deep breath and reach my other hand up ."
"he grabs it and begins to pull me up ."
"`` under your right foot , there 's a rock , '' he says , peering over the edge ."
"`` do n't look down , just feel for it ."
"just an inch to your left ."
"keep looking at me . ''"
"the expression in his eyes arrests me , and i still for a moment , then slowly begin to move my foot to the left ."
"there ."
"i feel my sneaker knock against it , and move my foot up and onto it ."
"`` ok , now just push off and i 'll pull you up ."
"one , two , three ! ''"
"i shove my foot down and he kneels and pulls me up and back onto him ."
"i land squarely on top of him , shaking with fear and adrenaline ."
"i feel his arms reach around me and squeeze , almost pressing the last of the air out of me ."
"`` fuck , brynn , '' he whispers in my ear ."
"`` are you ok ? ''"
"i reply , realizing he 's landed on his back ."
"`` am i ok ?"
"are you ? ''"
"he says , sounding shocked ."
"`` um , i think so , though it 's hard to tell right now . ''"
"`` oh , sorry ."
"here , stand up , '' he says , and i lean to the side of him ."
"he jumps up then offers me both hands ."
"i take them and stand , wincing as i put weight on my right foot ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"`` my ankle , i think . ''"
"`` let 's get back on the trail where i can look at it . ''"
"he takes my arm and wraps it around his shoulder ."
"i feel his arm around my waist and i 'm practically lifted off my feet as he walks me back onto the trail ."
"he guides me down to a seated position and i lean back on my hands as he gently picks up my right foot ."
"`` it 's a little swollen , '' he observes , `` but i do n't think it 's broken-probably a bad sprain ."
"think you 're ok to walk back if i help you ? ''"
"`` yeah , i 'll be fine , '' i assure him ."
"he helps me stand up and puts my arm around his shoulders ."
"i take a deep breath as we take our awkward first steps back toward the boathouse , and i realize i 'm in for a full hour of being pressed up against him ."
"`` you 're really sweaty , you know that ? ''"
"i say with a smile ."
"`` hey , you better be careful or i might lose my grip , '' he replies ."
"`` how high up was i ? ''"
"`` probably best not to think about it . ''"
"`` that 's pretty high . ''"
"`` well , i 'm glad you 're alright ... mostly . ''"
"i do n't know if it 's the scare from almost falling , or if we 're both just tired , but the slow walk back takes place in almost silence ."
"i wish i could think of something to say to break the tension , but having his shirtless body pressed up against me is too much ."
"i can feel our sweat mingling together and our breath syncing along with the rhythm of our footsteps ."
"as we finally sight the parking lot , he stops and moves in front of me , then bends over , looking back at me expectantly ."
"i laugh and lift my bad leg up onto him , and then jump up as he hoists me the rest of the way ."
"he walks with me on his back until we reach the car , then deposits me right next to the passenger side door ."
"as he jogs around to the driver 's side , i turn to look around the parking lot ."
"there are still only a few cars here , and in the corner is a blue sedan with a woman wearing sunglasses behind the wheel ."
"i stare at her for a moment , because with her blonde hair , i thought for a moment that she was my mom ."
"as we make eye contact she quickly looks away , and i hear the car start after a moment ."
"maybe she was just staring at nate like the other women we encountered today ."
"or maybe she 's a reporter ... pierce warned the family that there could still be a few hanging around ."
"`` are you ok to get in by yourself ? ''"
"nate asks , rolling down the window ."
"`` oh , yeah , sorry , '' i reply , snapping back to attention ."
"i open the door and use my left leg to hop into the elevated seat ."
"`` everything alright ? ''"
"he asks ."
"`` yeah , it 's fine . ''"
"when we arrive back at the house , nate basket-carries me straight from the car into the kitchen , gently setting me down on a chair in the breakfast nook ."
"he kneels in front of me and unlaces my shoe , then slips it off and peels my sock off ."
"`` can you wiggle your toes ? ''"
"i move them back and forth ."
"`` and now really slowly move your whole foot around . ''"
"i wince as i circle it and pain shoots up through my leg ."
"`` i broke my ankle playing lacrosse my junior year , and i do n't think that 's what this is ."
"let 's ice and wrap it and see how it is tomorrow , or monday ."
"if it 's still bad , i 'll take you to the doctor . ''"
"`` you know how to wrap it ? ''"
"`` hey , when it 's not my own hand , i 'm pretty good at it . ''"
"i watch him take down that same first aid kit from the cabinet and set it down on the floor as he kneels in front of me again ."
"he carefully wraps athletic tape around my ankle and then around the middle of my foot , hooking it around and around until my ankle is firmly stabilized ."
"`` ok , let 's get you into the den so we can ice it . ''"
"i begin to stand but he bends over and scoops me up again , carrying me through the hallways to the cozy den ."
"he sets me down on the couch and then disappears ."
"i grab a pillow and set it behind my back as i stretch my legs out , marveling at the sudden appearance of nate 's caretaker instincts ."
"he reappears with a ziploc bag of crushed ice and a glass of water , setting the latter down on the table next to me before lowering the ice down onto my ankle ."
"i shiver as he places it down , and he pulls the throw down from the back of the couch ."
"he grabs one end and unfolds it , then sits on the edge of the couch next to me to lay it over me , tucking the corners in around my body ."
"i become very aware of my own breathing as he moves over me ."
"i watch his hands as they take the edge of the blanket and tuck it around my shoulders ."
"his right hand moves slowly from the blanket onto the exposed skin of my neck ."
"i hold my breath as he lightly runs his fingertips up onto my jaw , then over to my chin ."
"with his thumb and forefinger , he gently tilts my head up until i look at him ."
"he 's staring at my mouth , and only pauses for a moment before he bends down ."
"`` please do n't , '' i whisper as he 's just inches away from kissing me ."
"`` if you do n't want anything more , it 's just cruel . ''"
"`` what if i do want something more ? ''"
"he says , his dark blue eyes flicking up to mine ."
"`` more ... '' i repeat , rolling the word around my tongue ."
"`` what kind of more ? ''"
"`` i 've never felt about someone the way i feel about you ."
"i 've tried fighting that feeling , i 've tried reasoning with it , but it just keeps getting stronger ."
"i have to give in-i need to ."
"i ca n't tell you i know exactly what this will look like ... i 've never done anything like it ."
"but i promise you that when i 'm with you , i 'll be with only you ."
"and i want you to be with only me . ''"
"i stare up at him ."
"that 's still a lot of unknowns , but i sense that he 's giving me everything he can right now ."
"plus my heart is about to beat out of my chest , and my resistance is giving out ."
"`` only you , '' i nod , before reaching around his neck and pulling him toward me ."
"our lips meet in an open kiss , our tongues finding each other 's and mingling with desperate passion ."
"he presses me back against the cushion , his hands grasping my waist over the blanket and quickly moving up and over my breasts ."
"i arch my back into him , wanting to feel him against me ... feel him everywhere ."
"`` you guys home ? ''"
"nate jumps away as we hear my mom 's voice from the foyer ."
"he takes a deep breath and then runs his hand through his hair before responding ."
"`` we 're in the den ! ''"
"he calls back , then turns to me ."
"`` tonight , '' he murmurs , his eyes burning with promise ."
"chapter twenty `` are you ok , brynn ? ''"
"my mom asks me , frowning ."
"`` yeah , i 'm fine , '' i reply lightly as i use my napkin to try to clean the tomato sauce off my shirt where i 've just spilled it ."
"nate 's promise of an evening rendezvous has left me clumsy and distracted throughout dinner ."
"i had just finished cleaning up the glass of water i knocked off the table when i dropped a piece of chicken off my fork and onto my shirt ."
"`` sorry i could n't make it today , guys , '' pierce says ."
"`` looks like you could have used some more supervision ."
"nate should n't have taken you on any dangerous trails . ''"
"`` oh , it was n't dangerous , '' i rush to nate 's defense ."
"`` he was trying to teach me how to spot poison ivy , actually , and i walked right off the trail ."
"i did n't realize how close i was to the edge and the ground just gave way under me ."
"it was all my fault ."
"he was the one who pulled me back up and taped my ankle . ''"
"`` well , it could n't hurt to get it looked at by a doctor on monday , '' my mom points out ."
"`` i think it 'll be fine , really , '' i insist ."
"`` anyone want dessert ? ''"
"my mom asks ."
"`` no , thanks , '' nate and i both respond at the same time ."
"i bite my lip to keep from laughing ."
"`` what 's so amusing ? ''"
"pierce asks , looking at his son , his voice dangerously quiet ."
"`` inside joke , '' i reply quickly ."
"`` i 'll help you clear the table , mom . ''"
"we both stand and grab a couple plates and head into the kitchen ."
"as soon as the swinging door shuts behind me , i hear pierce 's voice ."
"even though his words are muffled , i can tell by his tone that he 's berating nate for something ."
"i look at my mom ."
"she turns on the water and begins rinsing off the plates before putting them into the dishwasher ."
"`` is it ok with you that he talks to nate like that ? ''"
"`` it 's between the two of them , '' my mom replies quietly without looking up at me ."
"i feel anger surge inside me ."
"`` you keep trying to make us a family , but then you wo n't get involved in their relationship ."
"you ca n't have it both ways . ''"
"before she can reply , i spin back around and into the dining room ."
"pierce breaks off abruptly as i enter the room , and i quickly clear the rest of the dishes before limping upstairs to my room ."
"i take a deep breath as i close my bedroom door behind me ."
"i do n't want to have this night ruined by my anger at my mom and pierce ."
"i head into the bathroom and turn on my shower ."
"i still have n't had a chance to wash off the sweat from our kayaking and hiking trip today , and i want to smell like a rose tonight ."
"my body tingles in anticipation as i peel off my shirt and shorts ."
"i glance down at my wrapped ankle , wondering if it 's ok to get wet ."
"probably fine ."
"i pull off my sports bra and underwear and then study myself in the mirror , running my hands over my breasts and then across my stomach ."
"nate 's already seen me naked , i remind myself , as nerves surge up in my stomach ."
"and i already know he likes me ."
"it will be ok ."
"i step under the hot stream of water and take my time washing my hair ."
"as the conditioner sets , i shave my legs and my bikini line , going a little bit narrower than i would normally ."
"i know that a lot of girls at college go completely bare , but i ca n't bring myself to go that far ."
"i turn off the water and towel myself off , then part my hair in the middle and let it air dry ."
"i pull a pair of cotton pajama bottoms and a camisole from my bureau and put them on ."
"i 'm not sure if that 's sexy or not , but i 'm trying not to overthink it ."
"i 'm certainly not succeeding , but i am trying ."
"i head over to my computer and sit down ."
"i know that nate will probably wait for our parents to go to bed before he does anything , so i 've got a couple of hours to go at least ."
"i begin to click around the internet , but i 'm not able to absorb myself in anything ."
"i keep wondering what 's going to happen tonight ."
"i do n't want to get my hopes up , but i think i have an idea ."
"or at least , i know what i want to happen ."
"i finally decide to play some mindless tv on hulu , and settle back in my chair ."
"`` goodnight , brynn ! ''"
"i finally hear my mom call as she heads up to the third floor ."
"i freeze ."
"`` goodnight ! ''"
"i call back , and immediately begin pulling at the ends of my hair ."
"i keep watching tv until i hear pierce heading upstairs , too , then quickly close my computer and hurry into the bathroom , wincing as i put too much weight on my right ankle ."
"i run my fingers through my hair and decide i should brush my teeth ."
"just as i 'm putting my toothbrush back down , i hear a soft knock at my door ."
"my heart jumps in my chest ."
"i walk back into my bedroom just in time to see the door open and nate stick his head in ."
"`` hi , '' i murmur ."
"`` hi , '' he replies , taking a couple more steps in and closing the door behind him ."
"i smile at him nervously ."
"i suddenly have no idea what to say-the usual ease of conversation between us is replaced with jittery nerves and excitement ."
"his appearance right now is n't helping matters ."
"he 's barefoot , and wearing jeans and a v-neck white t-shirt ."
"he looks impossibly , effortlessly sexy ."
"`` i ca n't remember the last time i was nervous with a woman , '' he finally says ."
"`` oh , well ... good ."
"i 'm nervous , too , i mean . ''"
"he smiles and begins to walk slowly toward me ."
"`` i want to do everything with you , brynn ."
"the idea of being the first one to show you ... everything ... '' he takes a deep breath ."
"`` but i 'm going to go slowly ."
"you have to tell me if i 'm ever moving too quickly , alright ?"
"it 's going to be hard for me not to get caught up in the moment . ''"
"i nod and realize that i 've been holding my breath while he 's been talking ."
"he stops just in front of me and wraps his arms around my waist , then leans his head forward until his forehead rests against mine ."
"`` come to bed , '' he whispers ."
"a thrill of pleasure runs through me ."
"`` you do n't know how long i 've wanted to hear you say that . ''"
"he grins widely and presses his lips against mine ."
"in contrast to our recent urgent caresses , this one is slow and gentle ."
"perhaps because we know we 're finally on the same page , and we have all night to spend with each other ."
"his tongue delicately flicks against mine , and i feel his hands move under my ass and pick me up ."
"he spins and walks to the bed , setting me down in a seated position on the edge ."
"`` is there anything ... in particular you want tonight ? ''"
"`` i just want you , '' i reply with a shrug ."
"`` well , that i can do . ''"
"he grabs the bottom of his t-shirt and pulls it off over his head ."
"i bite my lip ."
"the tightness and size of his muscles always takes me aback ."
"i lean forward and nuzzle my nose into the hair just under his belly button , then softly kiss him ."
"i hear a low grunt from the back of his throat and lean back to look at him questioningly ."
"he 's looking down at me like he 's about to devour me in one bite , but he takes a deep breath and kneels down in front of me , spreading my knees apart so he can push right up against me ."
"he pulls me toward him and opens my lips with his ."
"as our tongues meet , i feel his fingertips gliding softly over the top of my camisole , barely touching my right breast ."
"i press forward into his hand , but he pulls back ."
"i quickly learn my lesson and stay still as his fingers return , teasingly running just under the fabric ."
"finally i feel him reach up with both hands and pull the cotton down and hook it under my breasts so it stays put ."
"he dips his head and pulls my breasts together , taking one nipple into his mouth and sucking on it , then quickly moving over to the other ."
"i moan and tilt my head back as my hands grip the comforter beside me ."
"he backs off and takes the bottom hem of my shirt , pulling it off over my head ."
"`` you have the most gorgeous breasts , '' he breathes , palming them as though he 's sculpting clay ."
"`` really ?"
"i 've always been self-conscious of them . ''"
"`` why ? ''"
"he looks at me in shock ."
"`` they 're perfect . ''"
"he leans forward to kiss me softly , then begins to unbutton his jeans ."
"`` wait , um , can i ? ''"
"i stop him ."
"he smiles at me and stands ."
"i slowly reach forward and finish unbuttoning them , then move the zipper down ."
"i can feel his eyes on me , but i keep my gaze on what i know is waiting for me underneath his denim ."
"the arch of his cock is pressing against his boxer-briefs as i push his jeans past his knees ."
"i pause and then take the sides of his waistband and pull them out and around ."
"his thick mushroom tip springs out as soon i pull the boxers down ."
"he 's so big that i ca n't begin to imagine how he 's going to fit inside me ."
"my worry must read on my face , because he says , `` we 'll take it slow . ''"
"i nod and push the boxers down to his jeans , holding them as he steps out of them ."
"i gulp as i 'm face-to-face again with his manhood ."
"`` have you ever ... ? ''"
"he asks leadingly , nodding down at himself ."
"`` never , '' i reply ."
"`` give me your hands . ''"
"i obey , reaching up to place mine in his large outstretched palms ."
"he places one on his thigh , and brings the other to his shaft ."
"he wraps it around the base , and then moves it up to his tip , then back down ."
"`` just like that ."
"nice and easy at first . ''"
"he removes his hand and i keep going , feeling the soft , veiny skin of his cock ripple slightly at my touch ."
"he takes my other hand and places it on his balls , massaging them with me ."
"his hands then drop by his sides , and i look up to see his eyes closing and his lips parting ."
"instinctively , i lean forward and , tucking my lips over my teeth , i take him inside my mouth ."
"i hear him gasp and i smile inwardly ."
"he does n't know that i 've read my fair share of dirty books , even if i 've never actually put anything into practice ."
"i keep moving my mouth down his length , seeing how far in i can take him ."
"i stop when he hits the back wall of my mouth , though i 'm still not at his base , and then begin to slide back out ."
"`` oh , fuck , brynn ."
"you sure you 've never done this before ? ''"
"he asks me , eyes wide as i swirl my tongue around his tip and then pull him back inside my mouth ."
"i move my hand back to his balls and massage him again as i move up and down his dick ."
"i hear him moan and feel his hand move to the back of my head , his fingers grasping my hair ."
"`` enough , '' he grunts , pulling his hips back ."
"`` stand up . ''"
"normally when nate takes that tone with me or orders me around , it really gets under my skin ."
"but right now , it 's turning me the hell on ."
"i jump to my feet ."
"he abruptly takes the elastic waist of my pants and yanks them to the ground ."
"we stand facing each other naked , the air between us charged ."
"without taking his eyes off mine , he reaches forward and between my legs ."
"i cry out softly as he slips one finger over my wet clit , and then inside me ."
"i almost fall forward at the strength of my reaction to his touch , and have to grab onto his shoulders to support myself ."
"he pulls me into him so that i 'm curled against his chest , my head resting just under his chin ."
"his finger moves in and out of me , and his thumb flicks over my clit ."
"i reach down and begin to run my hand up and down his cock like he showed me , though i 'm so turned on that i 'm hardly aware of what i 'm doing ."
"`` you 're almost ready , '' he whispers ."
"he pulls his hand out of me and picks me up under the armpits and tosses me onto the bed ."
"in a second he 's pushing my legs apart and kneeling between them ."
"his head ducks down and i buck wildly as his tongue takes a long lick of my clit ."
"i feel him slip two fingers inside me , and can feel him pressing them all around , stretching me out ."
"his tongue circles and flicks against me the whole time , until i begin to unravel ."
"`` oh , nate , oh , yes ! ''"
"i cry out , but he stops ."
"i gasp at the sudden lack of contact and pick up my head to look at him ."
"he 's no longer between my legs , but standing to get something out of his jeans ."
"he smiles at me as he shows me the condoms he 's taking out of his pocket ."
"he rips one off and pulls it open with his teeth , then tosses the rest on the bed next to me as he walks back ."
"i watch as he holds it to his tip and then unrolls it down his shaft ."
"then he kneels back on the bed , his legs between mine , and lies down on top of me with his weight on his elbows ."
"`` this first time will probably hurt a little , but it 'll feel good soon , '' he promises , brushing a strand of hair behind my ear ."
"i nod nervously ."
"he kisses me , his tongue softly caressing mine , as i feel his dick against my opening ."
"i ca n't believe it 's finally happening ."
"he reaches down , pulling my leg up and holding it against his hip as he takes his cock in his other hand , positioning it at just the right angle ."
"i gasp as he enters me and sharp pain reverberates through my entire lower half ."
"i feel his hips stop their forward motion ."
"he moves his mouth over to my ear , softly sucking on my earlobe and darting his tongue in and out as he moves forward again ."
"the pleasurable sensation at my ear helps to distract me from the massive pressure i feel pressing into me ."
"i close my eyes and wrap my arms around his back , willing myself to relax ."
"i know i 'm in good hands ."
"just when i think the pain will be more than i can handle , he stops , and i can feel the skin around his hips pressing against mine ."
"he 's all the way in ."
"he circles around slowly , and i feel my first twinge of pleasure at the sensation ."
"he pulls his head back and looks at me ."
"`` ok ? ''"
"he asks ."
"i nod , feeling breathless ."
"without taking his eyes off me , he begins to pull back out , all the way to his tip , before sliding in again ."
"he pulls out a second time , and as he returns , my lips part in surprise at my body 's response ."
"i think he can sense that i 'm starting to warm to the sensation , because he begins to move a little faster ."
"`` oh , nate , that feels ... it feels ... '' i trail off ."
"there are no words ."
"i simply wrap my legs around his back and dig my hands into his hair as he moves against me , as exquisite waves flow through my body ."
"his lips find mine again , kissing me with a passion that matches the faster pace he 's setting ."
"i feel an orgasm begin to build inside me ."
"i 've had orgasms before , including an amazing one with nate , but this one feels different ."
"it 's so powerful that it scares me ."
"i bear down against it , holding my breath to keep it at bay ."
"but everything nate is doing is working against me ."
"i feel his hands move to my breasts , and my back arches against the heat of his palms ."
"he kisses my neck as i bend to him , and his cock finds new and untouched nerve endings to drive me to the edge ."
"`` oh , nate , it 's too much ... '' i breathe , opening my eyes ."
"`` i do n't know if i can . ''"
"he slows down for a moment ."
"`` brynn , you 're safe with me , '' he murmurs , his dark eyes finding mine , tenderness and passion mixed in them ."
"`` you just have to let go ."
"let go with me . ''"
"he begins to speed up , but his eyes do n't leave mine ."
"i follow his advice , trying to let the orgasm take me rather than trying to control it ."
"`` yes , yes , brynn , '' he grunts as my eyes roll back in my head ."
"he slams his hips into me now , driving his cock inside me ."
"i hear myself begin to moan as though i 'm outside of my own body ."
"his torso lifts off of me and he thrusts in a little deeper ."
"the slightly new angle is enough to push me right over the edge ."
"i completely lose control , my body arching with spasms of its own accord ."
"i can vaguely feel him bucking on top of me , his sweat dripping down onto my skin ."
"he collapses on top of me and i tuck my face into his neck ."
"his body weight feels exactly right on top of me ."
"i feel like i could stay like this forever ."
"chapter twenty-one i wake up to soft kisses on my cheek ."
"my eyes flutter open in surprise ."
"`` mmm ? ''"
"i murmur incoherently ."
"`` you passed out , '' i hear nate whisper back ."
"i realize he 's still on top of me-and inside me ."
"`` oh , sorry , '' i smile , blushing a bit ."
"`` i hope i did n't make too much noise . ''"
"he grins ."
"`` well , i think if they 'd heard anything , we would have known about it by now . ''"
"`` how long was i asleep for ? ''"
"`` just twenty minutes or so ."
"i was worried i was going to crush you . ''"
"he kisses my lips and then reaches down ."
"i watch him hold the base of the condom as he pulls out of me ."
"the sensation of him leaving my body is jarring , and i lay still for another minute , absorbing it , as he walks to the bathroom ."
"he comes back with a couple of wet tissues and i sit up to take them from him ."
"`` it 's ok , '' he says ."
"`` lie back . ''"
"i obey , and feel him carefully wiping up the inside of my thigh , and then begin to giggle ."
"he stops and looks at me with a confused frown ."
"`` i 'm sorry , i just-i never thought i 'd be in this position with nate thornhill ! ''"
"i explain ."
"he shakes his head with a bemused grin as i continue to giggle ."
"`` you bled a little , but it did n't get on the comforter ."
"that would have been tough to explain , '' he says as he returns to the bathroom ."
"`` i could have just said i had my period , '' i point out as i pull my comforter back and crawl underneath the sheets ."
"`` oh , i guess that 's true , '' he says , coming back and sliding into bed next to me ."
"`` i ca n't believe i 'm not a virgin anymore , '' i grin as he wraps his arms around me and pulls me close ."
"`` i was beginning to think it would never happen . ''"
"`` so ... you liked it ? ''"
"he asks , running his fingers up and down my arm ."
"i 'm shocked to feel my body respond hungrily , as though i have n't just had a mind-blowing orgasm twenty minutes ago ."
"`` are you kidding me ? ''"
"i ask , raising my eyebrows at him ."
"`` what about me ?"
"was i ... '' `` you were excellent , '' he assures me ."
"`` it was different , though . ''"
"`` different , how ? ''"
"i ask , frowning ."
"he shrugs ."
"`` i usually do n't really know the girls i sleep with ."
"or have feelings for them ."
"even the ones i get to know , because we 're hooking up regularly , i 'll end it when they get too clingy . ''"
"a fissure of concern rises in my chest ."
"`` so ... do n't get clingy ? ''"
"`` that was n't a warning , '' he says , turning to me with a smile ."
"`` besides , i do n't think of you as clingy ."
"stubborn , maybe . ''"
"`` gee , thanks , '' i reply , rolling my eyes ."
"`` so , why did it never happen ?"
"losing your virginity ? ''"
"he asks , turning to me and resting his head on his elbow ."
"`` well , i guess it 's not that surprising ."
"i 've never really dated ."
"my first kiss was with this guy david in my junior year of high school ."
"it was really fast ."
"and gross ."
"his tongue just sort of darted in and out of my mouth ."
"and then senior year , and freshman year of college , a few guys took me out , but it never really went anywhere ."
"i mean , they were fine , but i really wanted to dedicate myself to studying , and getting a scholarship and all that . ''"
"`` did your mom put a lot of pressure on you to do well in school ? ''"
"i smile ."
"`` the opposite , actually ."
"she was always begging me to get my head out of a book and put on some lip gloss ."
"which of course just made me want to stick my head even further into a book ."
"i just never wanted to end up like her . ''"
"nate raises his eyebrows at me , and i sigh ."
"`` i mean , dependent on men ."
"she never really learned how to do anything because she 's so beautiful and charming and men would always do everything for her ."
"but when i came along , they stopped coming around so much , and she had to take care of me all by herself ."
"and even when they did , they 'd eventually leave , and she 'd be devastated ."
"curled up in bed for days , depressed , unable to care for herself ... '' `` so then you started taking care of her , '' he finishes ."
"i nod ."
"we settle back into the pillows for a minute ."
"`` your mom should have known that not all books are created equal , though , '' nate begins thoughtfully ."
"`` some are far more interesting than others . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"i ask , with absolutely no idea what he 's talking about ."
"with a devilish grin , he reaches over me and opens my bedside table ."
"i shriek and grab his arm as i see his fingers graze over my copy of lady chatterley 's lover ."
"but to my far more infinite horror , his hand keeps searching back and returns to the bed with my hot pink vibrator ."
"`` oh my god , put that back ! ''"
"he ignores me , and studies it thoughtfully as my cheeks burn ."
"`` someday i 'd like to watch you use this on yourself , '' he comments ."
"my mouth drops open and he glances up at me , his eyes boring into me ."
"`` what do you think about that ? ''"
"`` i ... i do n't know , '' i whisper ."
"`` not tonight , '' he assures me , replacing the vibrator in the drawer and turning back to me ."
"`` tonight , i 'll do all the work . ''"
"i gasp as i feel his fingers slip between my legs and rub against my clit ."
"`` you have no idea how much it turns me on to be your first for all of this . ''"
"`` mmhm , '' i reply distractedly as my eyelids flutter ."
"no way can i concentrate on speaking with his hand down there ."
"`` brynn , keep looking at me . ''"
"`` why ? ''"
"i whine ."
"`` because i like to tease you , '' he replies simply ."
"i bite my lip and turn my head back to him ."
"his fingers rub my aching nub over and over again ."
"`` i like it when you order me around , '' i whisper , feeling shocked to hear myself say such a thing out loud ."
"his eyes widen ."
"`` you do ? ''"
"`` only in bed , '' i explain ."
"i watch his pupils dilate and his jaw muscles contract , as though he 's struggling against some powerful reaction ."
"he sucks in a breath of air and then blows it out of his mouth slowly ."
"`` oh , brynn , there are so many things i want to do to you ."
"but we ca n't just jump from zero to sixty . ''"
"i nod in understanding and then moan as he slips a finger inside me ."
"`` you 're so wet already ."
"you want round two ? ''"
"all i can do is moan in affirmation ."
"`` turn around , '' he orders me , and a thrill of desire rushes through me ."
"i obey , turning over onto my other side so that my back 's to him ."
"he runs his hand over my ass and then back between my legs and inside me ."
"i hear him fumbling with his other hand and then the sound of a condom being ripped open ."
"`` put your arms over your head , '' he tells me ."
"i place them over my ears and onto the pillow , bending my elbows so that they do n't hit the headboard ."
"i feel his hand press down against my forearms , his long fingers easily reaching completely around me , and pinning me to the pillow ."
"his other hand slides out of me and pulls my hips back toward him ."
"i begin to tremble with anticipation , but do n't have to wait very long ."
"i feel his cock at my slit , pushing into me as he holds me in place ."
"i cry out from pain and pleasure as he reawakens the soreness he created the first time , but unlike that time , the pleasure is also instant and intense ."
"i feel his mouth at my ear ."
"`` you like that ? ''"
"`` yes , oh god , yes , '' i moan ."
"he thrusts into me faster ."
"`` it 's so hard to hold back with you , '' he mutters , almost to himself ."
"`` you do n't have to , '' i reply ."
"i hear him grunt in response and slam into me harder ."
"suddenly i feel myself being picked up and turned over ."
"before i know it , i 'm on my hands and knees without nate and me ever losing contact ."
"i have to bite my lip to keep myself from screaming out in pleasure as he pulls out and drives back in ."
"he 's in so deep now , pressing directly against my g-spot with every thrust ."
"my body begins to shake with another orgasm and this time , i let myself go with it ."
"i feel nate 's hands pulling my hips back to meet his with every thrust as he comes with me ."
"my elbows collapse down with the final shudder of my orgasm , and nate lands on top of me , immediately kissing the back of my neck ."
"`` oh , brynn , i 'm sorry , '' he murmurs , as he pulls my hair out of my face ."
"`` sorry ?"
"why are you sorry ? ''"
"i ask , befuddled ."
"`` you 're crying ... i 'm so sorry ."
"i was too rough , i went too quickly , i- '' he rushes on , sounding horrified ."
"my brain tries to catch up with him ."
"`` no , no ."
"it did n't hurt ."
"i did n't even realize i was crying ."
"everything felt amazing . ''"
"his body relaxes against mine ."
"`` i was so scared for a second there ."
"i thought i hurt you . ''"
"`` no , honestly ... '' i reach up to touch my face , and he 's right-my cheeks are damp ."
"`` that 's so strange ."
"this does n't happen a lot ? ''"
"he pulls himself up so he can look at me with an ironic grin ."
"`` i do try not to make girls cry , brynn . ''"
"i laugh ."
"`` i 'm sorry , i just meant ... i wondered if this happens to other girls ."
"i suppose i do n't usually ... you know , let go of control like that ."
"maybe the emotional release ... '' `` maybe ."
"just as long as you 're ok. '' `` i 'm more than ok , '' i assure him ."
"`` sore ? ''"
"i nod ."
"`` a little . ''"
"`` i 'll get you some water , '' he says , kissing the back of my shoulder before gently pulling out of me ."
"he comes back from the bathroom with a glass for me , and sits up in bed with me as i drink it ."
"`` i wish you could sleep here , '' i murmur , resting my head on his shoulder ."
"i feel spent , relaxed ... and happy ."
"`` me too . ''"
"chapter twenty-two the next morning , i wake up reaching for nate , but he 's gone ."
"i turn over onto my back in frustration ."
"i thought that after we had sex my desire for him might fade a bit , become more manageable , but it 's even stronger now ."
"even though i can feel a little soreness and pain between my legs , i want him to take me again , and again , and again ."
"i glance at the clock and am shocked to see it 's almost noon ."
"well , i guess i did have a big day yesterday , between almost sliding down that cliff and losing my virginity ."
"i slide under the sheets to the side of the bed and sit up on the edge ."
"i roll my ankle and find that there 's barely any pain , though i guess i should leave the tape on for one more day just to be safe ."
"i stand and pull on a pair of yoga pants and a t-shirt and head downstairs to the kitchen and fix myself some breakfast ."
"my mom walks in just as i 'm sitting down at the breakfast table ."
"`` wow , that 's a lot of food , brynn , '' she comments , raising her eyebrows at the amount of eggs and toast on my plate ."
"`` starving , '' i reply , pausing only momentarily then continuing to shovel food into my mouth ."
"`` i can see that ."
"how 's your ankle ? ''"
"`` lot better . ''"
"i clear my throat ."
"i need to stop acting weird or my mom will know something 's up ."
"i put down my fork ."
"`` did you have a nice lunch with pierce yesterday ?"
"where 'd you go ? ''"
"`` the palm , '' she replies ."
"`` it was lovely ."
"pierce is a regular there and always gets the best table . ''"
"`` oh , good . ''"
"i glance up as nate slides opens the door from outside ."
"he winks at me and i quickly bury my head back in my food so that my mom ca n't see the blush spreading across my cheeks ."
"`` just returning from your morning workout , nate ? ''"
"my mom asks as she begins to fix herself some tea ."
"`` you 're both getting such late starts today . ''"
"`` must 've been that hike , '' nate replies nonchalantly ."
"`` how 's your ankle ? ''"
"`` lot better , '' i repeat , holding it out from under the table and rolling it around to demonstrate ."
"`` better keep the tape on for another day just to be safe . ''"
"`` that 's just what i was thinking . ''"
"`` anybody want some coffee ?"
"i 'm just putting some water on , '' my mom breaks in ."
"`` yes , please , '' we both chorus ."
"`` you know , i 'm so glad you two are getting along ."
"that 'step ' word has such a bad connotation , i suppose because of cinderella ... you know , the wicked stepsisters ."
"but of course , having a bigger family can be such a positive thing , '' she muses , turning up the burner on the stovetop ."
"i watch her for a moment , wondering if she 's trying to bring up something about what i said to her last night , about how she needs to get involved in pierce 's harsh treatment of his son ."
"`` very positive , '' nate replies seriously , not looking at me as i glare at him warningly ."
"it is so not the time for one of his smartass comments ."
"`` pierce and i are going to the farmer 's market in about an hour ."
"you guys want to come ? ''"
"and miss a chance to be alone with nate ?"
"`` i was thinking i was just going to sit by the pool today , '' i reply ."
"`` give my ankle a little more time to heal . ''"
"`` probably wise , '' my mom agrees ."
"`` what about you , nate ? ''"
"`` i have to , um ... '' he trails off , trying to come up with an excuse ."
"`` you know , i think my friend jackson might swing by later , so i better stay home . ''"
"`` ok , just the parents then , '' my mom with a faux sigh ."
"nate and my mom both leave the kitchen to take their coffee into other rooms , so i can finish off my breakfast in peace ."
"after i clean up my plates , i decide to head into the den and turn on the tv ."
"my body needs to digest that giant breakfast i just devoured ."
"pierce and my mom find me sitting in there on their way out the door , and i wave goodbye ."
"but as soon as the door closes , a ball of excitement forms in my stomach ."
"i 'm alone with nate ."
"i feel like a kid on christmas morning ."
"i push aside the throw and stand up , heading for the stairs and nate 's bedroom ."
"a flurry of nerves hits me as i walk down the hallway and knock softly on his door ."
"`` one sec ! ''"
"he calls back ."
"`` ok , come in . ''"
"i push the door open to find him standing just outside his bathroom , a white towel wrapped around his waist ."
"he 's dripping wet , having clearly just stepped out of the shower ."
"`` oh , it 's you , '' he says with a smile ."
"i shut the door behind me ."
"`` they just left . ''"
"`` how are you feeling , really ?"
"i want to make sure i did n't go too fast last night ."
"any regrets ? ''"
"i walk toward him ."
"`` i do have one regret . ''"
"he frowns in concern , his beautiful forehead marred by a line in between his eyebrows ."
"`` there was something i wanted to do last night , but i did n't get the chance . ''"
"the tension immediately leaves his face ."
"`` which was ? ''"
"he asks , the edge of his mouth twisting up in a questioning smile ."
"i reach forward and unwrap his towel in response , then kneel in front of him ."
"i watch his cock grow hard in front of my eyes as he gazes down at me ."
"without another word , i run my hands up the front of his thighs , feeling his leg hair under my palms disappear as it reaches the line of his hips ."
"i lean forward , trailing kisses just under his belly button ."
"he smells amazing-a heady mixture of fresh shower combined with the very personal scent of his package ."
"it 's unlike anything i 've smelled before , and though i have n't been with anyone else , i bet the smell is all his own ."
"i wrap my hands around the back of his thighs as i dip my head and kiss the base of his shaft ."
"his cock jumps slightly in response to my touch , and i hear him groan ."
"i wrap my hand around him , pulling him toward my mouth ."
"i circle my tongue lightly around his tip , licking up a bead of liquid that has just appeared there ."
"i move to the base of his dick , pressing my tongue down hard as i make my way back up the underside of his shaft , then flick my tongue around his tip ."
"then i tuck my lips around my teeth and wrap them around him , stretching my mouth wide to receive him ."
"i move slowly down his length , wanting to make him feel as good as he 's been making me feel ."
"and to tease him a little , too , if i 'm being perfectly honest ."
"i look up at him as i pull back , and see him biting his lip as he looks down at me ."
"i circle his tip with my tongue for a minute as he watches me ."
"i feel myself growing wet-why going down on him turns me on so much i do n't know , but it does ."
"his fingers wrap around the back of my head , digging into my hair , as he dips his head back ."
"i take him in my mouth again and begin to move faster ."
"i bring one hand up to massage his balls , and wrap the other around his shaft , following my mouth ."
"i still ca n't fit his whole cock in my mouth , so i figure this is kind of a good cheat ."
"my eyes begin to water a bit as i hear him begin to groan ."
"i move even faster , excited to feel him come in my mouth , and to taste him ."
"`` oh , fuck , fuck , i 'm coming , '' he moans , and suddenly my mouth is filled with liquid ."
"i keep moving my head back and forth even as i feel it leak a little out of the corner of my mouth ."
"should i swallow it ?"
"i do n't know what else to do , so i lean back for a moment and feel it run down my throat ."
"nate 's taking deep breaths above me , his chest heaving , so i lean forward again and kiss his shaft gently as it softens a bit ."
"i guess i expected it to , you know , go down right away , but it stays mostly erect as i stand back up ."
"to my surprise , he wraps his arms around me and kisses me ."
"i thought he might feel some compunction considering where my mouth has been , but his tongue slips readily against mine and i relax against him ."
"his hand slides down my ass and he rubs himself against me ."
"`` how much longer do you think they 'll be gone ? ''"
"he asks breaking away and bringing his other hand up to my cheek ."
"`` no idea . ''"
"`` well , i 'll make this quick , just in case . ''"
"he pushes me away and steps back ."
"`` strip . ''"
"i almost gasp at the pleasure his command sends rushing through me ."
"i pull off my shirt and yoga pants , then unhook my bra and slide my panties to the ground as he watches ."
"my lips part as he wraps his hand around his cock as it hardens completely again ."
"`` i want you to go on birth control soon , ok ?"
"i do n't want to have to wear a condom with you . ''"
"`` does it feel very different ? ''"
"`` oh yeah ."
"and i want to feel myself right up against you . ''"
"he walks over to his bedside table and pulls a condom out and tosses it on the bed ."
"`` come , '' he says , holding his hand out to me ."
"i walk over , and he turns me around , pulling my back against him ."
"i feel his cock hitting the small of my back as he runs his fingers over my stomach and then up over my breasts , gently pinching my nipples ."
"i groan into his touch ."
"i 've never felt anything close to the way he makes me feel ."
"`` a little faster and harder this time , ok ? ''"
"he asks , and i nod , already beyond speaking ."
"his fingers slide down and over my clit , and i can hear the sounds of my wetness as he presses one finger inside me ."
"`` you 're already so wet ... good girl . ''"
"his other hand snakes up to my face and turns my cheek so that i 'm facing him ."
"he kisses me , hard , his tongue ravaging my mouth as his finger circles inside my opening ."
"his thumb flicks over my clit and i cry out in pleasure and surprise ."
"as if he were just waiting for this response , he turns me around and pushes me down on my back on the bed ."
"he picks up the condom next to me and quickly rips it open and pulls it on ."
"he grabs my hips and steps forward , pulling my ass down so that it 's just on the edge of the bed ."
"he bends over me , quickly pulling my breast into his mouth and gently nibbling on my nipple ."
"he moves his weight onto his elbows and i feel him pressing inside me ."
"there 's a slight soreness left over from last night , but also instant pleasure ."
"he stretches me open , pushing slowly but surely until he 's all the way in ."
"my hands dig into his back as he thrusts again , a little harder ."
"then he stands up , still inside me , and pulls my legs up so that my calves are resting on his shoulders ."
"he moves his right hand over my crotch , and i moan as he begins to circle my clit with his thumb ."
"i cry out as he begins to pull in and out of me at the same time , and i watch his face as he watches himself move inside my opening ."
"the combination of his fingers on my clit and his cock inside me is quickly driving me crazy ."
"`` aaggh , '' i cry out intelligibly , and nate 's eyes snap up to my face ."
"he removes his hand from my clit and leans forward so that both of his palms are spread on the comforter ."
"my legs are still on his shoulders , and i can feel a good stretch in my hamstrings in this position ."
"i 'm also completely immobilized as he begins to drive into me in earnest now , his jaw tense and his neck muscles bulging ."
"i close my eyes and lose myself to the sensation of being drilled over and over again ."
"he 's hitting me so deeply , and i 'm absolutely out of control and powerless ."
"maybe it would make me nervous with some other man , but i feel completely safe with nate ."
"as an orgasm begins to rip through me , i feel his hands gripping my shoulders tightly , pulling me down against him as he comes inside me ."
"`` brynn , oh , fuck , brynn ! ''"
"he shouts as he releases himself ."
"my legs fall off his shoulders and splay onto the comforter as he collapses on top of me ."
"i gasp for air , and drowsily wipe the hair out of my face as i feel him stir on top of me ."
"he picks his head up and listens for a moment ."
"`` they 're still not home . ''"
"`` mm , guess not , '' i murmur rather incoherently ."
"`` good , '' he says with a wicked smile , and begins to kiss down the middle of my chest as he slides to his knees on the floor ."
"`` nate , what are you-oh , god , '' i moan , as he takes a long lick of my slit ."
"`` i ca n't wait until tonight to taste you again ."
"it 's like i 'm addicted to this , to you . ''"
"i close my eyes as he begins to flick his tongue across my clit ."
"i thought i was completely worn out , but i 'm coming back to life shockingly quickly under his deft tongue ."
"his hands pin my knees to the sides of the bed , stretching me wide open so that he has complete access and control ."
"i feel his tongue dart in and out of me-a completely different sensation than when he uses his fingers ."
"my back arches off the bed as he moves back to my clit , circling it relentlessly ."
"i whimper as i feel waves of pleasure begin to reverberate through my body ."
"my body wants to rock and shake , but nate 's hands pin me firmly to the bed , and his tongue keeps flicking across me ."
"my energy has no choice but to be completely directed to the reaction he 's eliciting ."
"for some reason , it 's when nate backs off slightly that my body rocks into a full-out orgasm , my back arching wildly off the bed , just the top of my head and my hips remaining in contact with the comforter ."
"`` oh my god , '' i breathe as i relax down ."
"i lift my head slightly and watch him lick his lips before lying down next to me on the bed and lazily flopping an arm over my waist ."
"`` we should get dressed , '' he reminds me , kissing me quickly before jumping back up ."
"i groan ."
"where 's he getting all this energy ?"
"i feel like i could sleep for days ."
"`` do you think there will ever be a day when we can tell them ? ''"
"i ask with a yawn as i sit up ."
"he pauses for a moment as he pulls open a dresser drawer ."
"`` i do n't know ."
"let 's just keep it our secret for now . ''"
"`` no , no , i was n't saying i- '' i break off as we both hear a car pulling up to the front of the house ."
"i hurry over to the pile of my clothes and ball them up in my arms before running to the door ."
"`` see you later ! ''"
"i call quietly over my shoulder as i dash naked down the hallway ."
"as i shut my door behind me and begin pulling on my clothes , i wonder why nate was so quick to suggest that we keep it quiet ."
"not that i want something different-for now , at least ."
"but someday ..."
"i mean , does he just envision keeping our relationship secret forever ?"
"what kind of relationship would that be , anyway ?"
"i sigh ."
"these kind of questions are what allison warned me about in the first place ."
"it 's just ... fuck ."
"what was once a far-off crush has become real for me ."
"too real ."
"and nate has said he has feelings for me , that i 'm different , but he has n't been any more specific than that ."
"on my end , i do n't think this is a purely sexual infatuation ."
"i 'm really falling for him ."
"chapter twenty-three going to work this week and being away from nate during the day has felt like going through physical withdrawal ."
"i really have to force myself to focus , because sometimes i find myself staring off into the distance , remembering what he did to me the previous night ."
"i wish i could just go straight home at six today , but i promised allison i 'd go shopping with her ."
"and there are actually a couple things i 'd like to pick up for myself ."
"i meet her at the anthropologie in georgetown mall , and we start going through the sale racks as we catch up ."
"while she 's not looking , i slip a couple sets of lingerie and sexy bras into my basket ."
"i want to wear something a little sexy for nate , but i do n't want to face allison 's inevitable questions if she sees what i 've picked out ."
"we eventually make our way to the changing rooms and begin trying on our choices ."
"i quickly slip on the first matching set of bra and panties ."
"i admire myself in the mirror ."
"the lace is a pale violet , and not overtly sexy-it 's anthropologie , not victoria 's secret , after all ."
"`` what do you think ? ''"
"allison asks suddenly , pulling the curtain aside and stepping into the dressing room with me ."
"she 's wearing a blue cotton dress and twirls for a second before she realizes what i 'm wearing ."
"her eyebrows raise ."
"`` whoa . ''"
"`` allison , '' i groan , pulling one of the more substantial pieces of clothing off a hanger to cover myself ."
"`` you know , i had a feeling something was different with you , '' she says , beginning to smile ."
"`` really ? ''"
"`` yup ."
"and i was right ."
"i always thought you two would make a good match . ''"
"`` what ?"
"that 's not what you said . ''"
"`` yeah , i totally called it ! ''"
"`` no , you completely warned me against the whole thing , '' i reply , confused and even slightly annoyed ."
"`` wait , '' she says with a frown , `` who are you talking about ? ''"
"`` who are you talking about ? ''"
"`` greg , obviously ... '' `` oh , right . ''"
"`` brynn ... '' `` what ? ''"
"i ask innocently ."
"`` if it 's not greg , who did you think i was talking about ? ''"
"she asks , her eyes widening ."
"`` it 's not important , ok ? ''"
"i reply , blushing ."
"`` brynn , no ."
"please tell me it 's not nate ."
"please ."
"i mean , he 's your stepbrother ."
"it 's ... it 's gross . ''"
"`` thanks a lot , allison ."
"not exactly what i needed to hear right now , '' i snap , turning my back to her to pull off the lingerie ."
"`` um , maybe it 's exactly what you need to hear right now ."
"i mean , what 's with you ?"
"you 're ignoring a perfectly nice guy to go out with some jock like nate . ''"
"`` well , first of all , it 's none of your business ."
"second of all , you 're actually completely right about greg ."
"he is 'perfectly nice . '"
"there 's no spark at all ."
"zero ."
"third of all , nate 's not 'some jock . '"
"he 's really smart , and kind , and funny ."
"and with him ?"
"sparks galore ! ''"
"`` god , brynn , i 'm just trying to look out for you ."
"you 're making some really bad decisions . ''"
"i take a deep breath , not wanting to raise my voice in this public place ."
"`` no , allison , you 're not trying to look out for me ."
"what you 're doing is judging me ."
"completely different ."
"and i really do n't appreciate it . ''"
"i finish pulling on my skirt and quickly slip my flats on as i grab my purse and walk quickly out of the dressing room ."
"i walk straight out of the store and toward the elevator to the parking garage , my cheeks burning with anger , though i also feel a bit like crying ."
"i 've never had a big fight like that with allison before , and i do n't like it ."
"i freeze outside another store just as i 'm about to reach the elevators ."
"victoria 's secret ."
"my relationship with nate is n't `` gross . ''"
"there 's nothing wrong with what we 're doing ."
"if anything , my conversation with allison has made me want to lean into my relationship with nate , not out of it ."
"i march in and straight to the raciest pieces i see ."
"when i get home , i hear my mom and pierce laughing in the kitchen , and the tv from the den ."
"i walk in there and smile in relief at the sight of nate with his feet up on the couch ."
"he moves his legs over and i plop down ."
"`` hi , '' i murmur with a smile ."
"`` hi , '' he replies ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"i frown at him , and he reaches up to his shoulder , miming pulling at something ."
"i stare at him for a moment before realizing he 's mirroring my own action of pulling at my hair ."
"i sigh and drop my hand ."
"`` it 's allison ."
"we had an argument , '' i explain ."
"`` she ... she found out . ''"
"he cocks his head and then lets out a low whistle as he realizes what i mean ."
"`` well , i suppose it 's not that bad ."
"i mean , i always thought ... '' he lowers his voice , looking back toward the kitchen where our parents are still talking ."
"`` i always thought that at school , we could be more open ."
"no one really knows you 're my stepsister there ."
"i mean , allison would have found out then anyway , right ? ''"
"`` i guess so ... she just ... she called it 'gross . '"
"we 're not , are we ? ''"
"`` well , i certainly do n't think there 's anything gross about you . ''"
"`` it 's more than that , though ."
"i feel like we 're drifting apart a little , '' i reveal , swallowing a ball of hurt in my throat ."
"`` mm , '' he replies , considering ."
"`` like me and jackson , sort of ."
"well , maybe you wo n't be quite as close as you were , but there are still things you can enjoy about her . ''"
"`` when 'd you get so wise ? ''"
"i ask , nudging his feet next to me ."
"`` since i started hanging out with you ."
"you 're rubbing off on me . ''"
"before i have time to consider whether he 's being serious or not , we hear my mom call , `` dinner ! ''"
"from the kitchen , and are forced to put our conversation on hold ."
"pierce seems to be in an unusually good mood during the meal , for which i 'm grateful ."
"not for his sake , but for nate 's , because he 's much less likely to snap at his son when he 's feeling jovial ."
"`` well , we have n't made an official announcement , brynn , but thornhill and co. has just landed mark broadman as a client , '' he reveals eventually ."
"`` the hedge fund billionaire ? ''"
"`` that 's right ."
"he has several new holdings , and needs advice on some public policy matters . ''"
"`` wow , that 's huge ."
"congrats , dad , '' nate chimes in ."
"pierce nods at him in a self-satisfied manner ."
"`` i 'm glad it 's all-i 'm glad that 's happened , pierce , '' i correct myself ."
"i almost referenced the scandal earlier this summer , but managed to change course ."
"we never talk about it now , though i know that pierce was concerned that it would negatively impact his business ."
"but landing such a big client is a good sign that people have moved on , and are on pierce 's side ."
"after dinner , nate and i leave the dining room separately , while our parents remain there chatting ."
"we always make a show of going our separate ways , to keep up appearances ."
"i close my bedroom door knowing that he 'll come for me around midnight , as he has every night this past week ."
"my body quivers with excitement just thinking about it ."
"i consider writing an email to allison , but decide i want a little more time to think about what to say ."
"i turn to my purse and pull out the bag from victoria 's secret that i stuffed to the bottom ."
"i touch the black lace panties , a narrow diamond-shaped piece of fabric that just covers the essentials , with several thin strips , string , really , hooking around my hips and latching on to the back ."
"the bra is conservative by contrast , though pretty with its chantilly lace-covered cups ."
"i take a shower and then head downstairs for a cup of tea ."
"i 'm taking a mug down from the top cupboard when i feel nate come up behind me ."
"he wraps his hands around my waist and presses against me ."
"`` nate , not here ! ''"
"i whisper ."
"`` i know , i 'm sorry , '' he murmurs in my ear ."
"`` i just want you all the time . ''"
"`` i have a surprise for you tonight , '' i admit ."
"he grinds his erection into my ass in response , his hands reaching under my shirt ."
"`` you 're killing me , '' he moans , then sighs , and rests his head on mine before pulling away ."
"`` see you soon . ''"
"i lean against the counter as i hear him retreat , my skin tingling where he 's touched it ."
"i know that sneaking around wo n't work forever , but for now , there 's something so hot about it ."
"i take my decaf earl grey up to my room , and change into the lingerie as i drink it , carefully pulling out the tags ."
"i sink into bed with a yawn , pulling the sheet up over me ."
"these late night assignations , while i would n't give them up for anything , are wreaking havoc on my sleep schedule ."
"the next thing i know , i 'm being woken up by someone sinking into bed next to me ."
"i turn into the warmth of nate 's body and slowly open my eyes ."
"`` sorry , should i just let you sleep ? ''"
"he asks , kissing the top of my head ."
"`` no way , '' i reply drowsily ."
"`` you have to have your surprise . ''"
"`` where is it ? ''"
"he asks , looking around ."
"i lift my arm and point down at my body ."
"he grins , and pinches the top of the sheet in his fingers and begins to slowly pull it down ."
"i bite my lip as i hear his sharp intake of breath as he reveals my bra ."
"he pauses , looking up at my face ."
"`` there 's more , '' i promise him ."
"he keeps pulling the sheet down , and finally pulls it over the barely-there panties ."
"he tosses the sheet at my feet and runs his hand from my knee up my inner thigh ."
"`` what shall i do with you tonight , brynn ? ''"
"he asks , eyeing my lingerie ."
"`` whatever you want , '' i breathe ."
"`` stand up , '' he says abruptly ."
"i stand , and he eyes me up and down , licking his lips , then narrows his eyes ."
"`` you have any high shoes ? ''"
"`` you mean heels ? ''"
"i ask , with a smile ."
"`` yeah . ''"
"`` put them on . ''"
"i walk over to my closet and slip them on , then walk back ."
"`` better ? ''"
"i ask , turning a little so he can see me from other angles ."
"`` nothing could make you look any better than you already do , brynn ."
"it was n't about your appearance , it was about your height . ''"
"i frown at him in confusion ."
"`` come here , '' he says , walking over to the bedpost nearest to the door ."
"i follow him ."
"he takes me by the hips and moves me so that my back is pressed up against it ."
"`` you remember what happened in this exact spot ?"
"the first time i tried to kiss you , you denied me . ''"
"i smile ."
"`` i remember how much self-control it took . ''"
"`` good answer ."
"stay there . ''"
"he walks over to my bureau and rummages around until he pulls out a couple of my old t-shirts and then walks back ."
"`` close your eyes . ''"
"i obey , and feel him wrap one of the shirts around my head , tying it in the back but slightly to the side , so that it does n't hit the bed post ."
"as he steps back , i try to open my eyes to test the blindfold , and find i ca n't see anything ."
"`` you trust me ? ''"
"he asks ."
"i nod ."
"`` hands behind your back ."
"grip the bedpost . ''"
"i feel my insides clench as i obey , spreading my palms against the solid wood of the bed ."
"a moment later , i feel the other t-shirt wrapping around both my wrists and the posts , holding me securely against it ."
"`` pull against it . ''"
"i try , but do n't get anywhere ."
"`` good . ''"
"i can sense him leaning in toward me , and feel the heat emanating from his body ."
"`` brynn , tonight i 'm going to make you beg for it , understand ? ''"
"i feel his warm breath against my cheek and squirm in anticipation against my bondage ."
"`` i 'm going to deny you until you ca n't take it anymore ."
"until you beg me ."
"say that you understand . ''"
"`` i understand . ''"
"he 's barely touched me , and i can already feel how wet i am against my new panties ."
"suddenly , i feel his fingertips on my arm , just above where the t-shirt is holding me to the bed ."
"he trails his fingers lightly up my arm , barely touching me ."
"my mouth drops open and i feel my heart rate speed up ."
"his fingers continue across my clavicle , then down my other arm ."
"as they make their way back up , i attempt to arch against him , but i ca n't ."
"he stops for a moment , then continues , his touch leaving a burning trail across my body ."
"his fingers run straight down my chest and over the middle of my bra ."
"just as i think he 's going to skip my breasts entirely , he moves back up and barely grazes the tops of my breasts , just above the cups ."
"i gasp as he makes contact , but he quickly moves away , running his fingers down to my ribcage , then across my stomach ."
"they dip for a moment into my belly button , and i hope he 's going to continue down to my panties , but he skips them entirely , jumping down to the top of my thighs ."
"he traces the length of one of my legs , then moves to the other ."
"as his fingers reach the top of my left leg , he breaks off contact ."
"i feel sweat collect on my palms , despite the coolness of my bedroom ."
"where is he ?"
"suddenly i feel his breath on my neck ."
"then his tongue is inside my ear , taking a long , languid lick ."
"i moan , and my hands grip the bedpost more tightly ."
"i hear him click his tongue ."
"`` brynn , we 've barely even started . ''"
"i let my head fall back against the bedpost ."
"how long is he going to torture me ?"
"as if in response , his hand slides up my neck to my chin , holding my face in place ."
"his lips press against mine , roughly opening my mouth to his tongue ."
"then he steps into me , his legs spreading mine open , his arms wrapping tightly around my waist ."
"the full contact is sweet relief , even if it does make me want him even more ."
"his right hand glides over my ass and pulls me against his erection ."
"my mouth is wide open to his , and our tongues massage each other 's ."
"his other hand glides up my stomach and slips under my bra cup ."
"i moan as i feel his calloused palm against my nipple ."
"he pulls his mouth away quickly and leans his torso back ."
"his fingers brush against the front of my bra for a moment , and then i feel his deft fingers unhook the front closure of my new bra ."
"i feel my breasts spring out , and his thumbs brush against my nipples as he cups them in his hands ."
"he begins to massage them more strongly , and suddenly i feel him sucking my right nipple into my mouth ."
"he flicks his tongue across it as he sucks , then moves to my other side ."
"`` i 'm ready , '' i moan ."
"`` uh-uh , not yet , '' he replies , pulling my breast out of his mouth for a moment ."
"then he begins to trail kisses down my stomach , pausing for a moment to circle his tongue in my belly button ."
"i feel him graze his fingers across the narrow strips of fabric on the sides of my panties ."
"`` i like these very much , '' he murmurs ."
"`` maybe we 'll try to keep these on . ''"
"then he 's gone ."
"i hear the sounds of what could be his shirt being pulled over his head , but i ca n't be sure ."
"there 's silence for another minute , and i 'm suspended in this pool of pleasure where he 's left me , completely under his control ."
"i gasp as i feel him blow a stream of warm breath against my panties and feel my body shake involuntarily ."
"his hands run up my thighs and then under the sides of my underwear , and i know he must be kneeling in front of me ."
"i feel him slowly dip one finger under the right side of my panties , pulling them away from my body and tucking them to the other side ."
"he blows on me again , and now his breath hits my clit directly ."
"`` spread your legs , '' he commands me quietly ."
"i obey , inching myself out on my high heels ."
"his tongue slides into my slit and i cry out ."
"`` oh , nate , '' i moan , and he begins to flick his tongue back and forth across me ."
"i unravel quickly , and he begins to speed up , circling his tongue rapidly ."
"but just as i 'm on the brink , my body arching as much as it can , he slows down again ."
"i whimper ."
"he does n't stop completely , but he 's not going fast enough to bring me release ."
"his right hand slips over my ass , under the fabric of my panties ."
"i gasp as he slips one finger inside me ."
"i 've never had anything back there ."
"he circles it inside me , mirroring his actions with his tongue ."
"once i get over my surprise at the foreign feeling , i find that i like it ."
"on top of everything that he 's already done to me , and is still doing , it 's driving me right toward the edge again ."
"i moan as he slips two fingers from his other hand inside my opening , making a beckoning motion against my g-spot ."
"i feel a spasm begin to rip through my body , but he pulls his mouth away completely ."
"my knees almost buckle at the empty feeling he 's left behind ."
"`` nate ... '' i protest ."
"he leans back in , flicking his tongue once , hard , over my clit ."
"my body ripples in response ."
"the pleasure has built up inside me to such an extent that being unable to let go of it feels painful ."
"i need him to let me come ."
"`` yes ? ''"
"he answers innocently , and tortures me with another hard flick of his tongue , his fingers still circling slowly inside me ."
"`` please ... '' the pleasure is overloading my brain , and i can barely think ."
"`` please what ? ''"
"`` i need you ... please ."
"i need you inside me right now ."
"please , i 'm begging you ."
"i 'm begging you , nate . ''"
"i almost faint with relief as he takes his fingers out of me and i hear the sound of a condom being ripped open ."
"he steps into me and grabs one of my legs , wrapping it around his waist as he thrusts into me ."
"i cry out at the contact ."
"he drives in hard , slamming me against the bed post , and on just his second thrust , i feel my orgasm finally releasing through me as he presses into me again and again ."
"his mouth covers mine as the last waves of pleasure crest over me ."
"even though i 'm exhausted , i can feel that he 's still hard inside me ."
"i feel him reach behind me , and realize that he 's unknotting the t-shirt around my hands ."
"my arms drop to my sides , and he pulls out of me ."
"i feel him taking my hips and turning me , then he presses one hand roughly down on my back and i realize he 's pressing my top half down onto the mattress ."
"i turn my head to the side so i can breathe as he pulls my panties , still bunched to one side , to my ankles ."
"his hand still holding me down , i feel him enter me from behind ."
"even though i 'm spent from my first orgasm and all the build-up leading to it , i feel my body begin to respond again ."
"i feel him slide his thumb into my ass and gasp ."
"i never realized how many nerves endings were back there ."
"`` brace yourself , '' he warns me , and begins to thrust harder into me ."
"my fingers search for the edge of the bed and i 'm just able to grasp it as he drives in deeper than he ever has before ."
"he plunges into me again and again , hitting my g-spot directly every time ."
"a second orgasm takes me by surprise , as though it was lying dormant until he awoke it ."
"my body arches and shakes as i feel him pull out of me and a wetness cover my back ."
"as my body quiets , i hear him hurrying to the bathroom and then him rubbing a tissue on my back ."
"`` i 'm sorry , i do n't know why i did that , '' he murmurs ."
"`` hm ?"
"did what ? ''"
"i mumble , reaching up to remove the makeshift blindfold from my eyes ."
"`` i ... i came on you , '' he replies , halting his wiping motions to look me in the eye ."
"`` nate ... it 's ok ."
"it does n't bother me , '' i assure him ."
"`` really ? ''"
"he asks , looking relieved ."
"`` i 've never done that before , i just ... i just wanted to see it on you , or something ."
"i 'm worried ... i worry i push you too far . ''"
"`` i like what we do together , '' i reply , stretching my arms above my head ."
"`` as far as i 'm concerned , we 're going to do a lot more , so you better get used to it . ''"
"`` is that so ? ''"
"he asks , with a smile ."
"`` yep ."
"now clean me off ."
"if we 're going to do this again tomorrow night , i need to get some sleep . ''"
"chapter twenty-four the next day , thornhill and co. is abuzz with the official announcement of mark broadman becoming a new client ."
"there 's talk that other high-profile investors could follow suit , including some of broadman 's contacts in silicon valley ."
"apparently the tech crowd is quite interested in influencing public policy ."
"i 'm just glad that everyone is in such a good mood , because it helps me fit in ."
"my relationship with nate , not to mention our late night sessions , has me practically glowing ."
"constance talks to me happily in our cubicle , the awkwardness of our first day of working together having finally melted away over the summer months ."
"she swivels in her chair and raises her eyebrows at me as greg walks by , giving me a small wave ."
"`` ok , what happened there ? ''"
"she asks conspiratorially ."
"`` it was nothing , '' i assure her , keeping my eyes on my computer , though i can see out of my periphery that she 's still looking at me ."
"`` oh , come on ."
"i wo n't tell ."
"but it 's obvious ... i mean , for a couple weeks you guys were hanging out a bunch , and now he completely avoids you . ''"
"i sigh ."
"`` we went on a couple dates , and then we decided to break it off ."
"but please keep it between us , alright ? ''"
"`` mmhm , '' constance murmurs , swiveling back around ."
"she can sense , rightfully so , that i 'm not telling her the whole story ."
"greg reacted as well as could be hoped when i told him i did n't want to go on any more dates with him ."
"i blamed the office environment , and said i had extra pressure on me to be professional as the boss 's stepdaughter , but i think he saw through that excuse ."
"at least he could never guess the real reason ."
"now whenever i see him he 's polite but standoffish ."
"i watch the corner of my screen , waiting to see if allison will send me a gchat message , but none arrives ."
"i 'll give it a little more time , and then reach out to her ."
"i do n't want to throw our whole friendship away over my relationship with nate-not that we do n't have some things to talk about ."
"it 's not that i need her approval exactly , but i do need her to stop judging ."
"`` lunch , '' constance says , nudging me ."
"i stand up and see other people making their way to the big conference room ."
"pierce has had lunch catered for the whole office to celebrate the new client ."
"as we walk in , i notice that the temporary wall to the kitchen has been pulled back to make way for everyone ."
"pierce and roderick , his business partner , stand by the buffet , happily talking with their employees ."
"pierce smiles at me as constance and i make our way up to grab some plates ."
"`` roderick , you 've met my stepdaughter brynn , right ? ''"
"`` yes , good to see you again , brynn , '' roderick , a well-dressed man a bit younger than pierce says , then turns away to shake someone 's hand ."
"pierce leans in ."
"`` you look particularly beautiful today , brynn , '' he remarks ."
"`` oh , thank you , pierce , '' i reply , a bit taken aback ."
"constance and i stand around the conference room for a while talking to the other interns , everyone sharing their plans for once they get back to school , and the rising seniors , like me , discussing what we 'll do after we graduate ."
"eventually the crowd begins to thin out , and constance and i each take a cupcake back to our cubicle ."
"`` what 's that ?"
"vanilla ? ''"
"she asks ."
"i peer at the frosting ."
"`` i think so , though i heard there were some coconut- '' i break off as my desk phone rings ."
"i look at it in surprise for a second-no one ever calls me on it-then reach forward to pick it up ."
"`` brynn speaking . ''"
"`` brynn , it 's pierce ."
"could you come into my office for a moment ? ''"
"`` oh , sure , i 'll be right there . ''"
"i hang up and stand ."
"`` pierce , '' i explain to constance ."
"`` probably wants to see if i 'll be home for dinner tonight . ''"
"she nods , and i walk down the hallway to his corner office ."
"`` he asked me to- '' i explain to his secretary , gwen ."
"`` sure , go on in , '' she replies , waving me in ."
"i knock softly as i open the door ."
"he beckons me inside and indicates i should take a seat across from his desk ."
"`` brynn , thanks for coming in , '' he says , standing and walking around his desk as he takes his reading glasses off and places them on his desktop calendar ."
"i look at him curiously as he sits on the edge of his desk in front of me ."
"`` i know that i 'm just your stepfather , but i hope that you know that you can always come to me with any ... difficulties . ''"
"`` um , sure ."
"yes , thanks , '' i stumble , surprised by the direction of the conversation ."
"he stands and begins to pace behind my chair ."
"`` you 're a very beautiful young woman , and i hope that you can see me as a sort of protector . ''"
"i feel him come up and stand behind the chair ."
"i start as he brushes my hair to the side and i feel his fingers graze against my skin just above the fabric of my dress ."
"`` i could n't help but notice this , '' he says ."
"`` what ? ''"
"i ask , frowning ."
"`` this bruise , '' he explains , still holding my hair to the side ."
"`` oh . ''"
"my mind races ."
"shit ."
"i bet i got it last night when nate had me up against that bed post , and of course it 's not in the sort of position where i 'd see it ."
"`` um , it 's nothing ."
"it 's probably old , maybe from when i fell on that hike . ''"
"`` i doubt it ."
"i mean , how far does it extend ... '' i 'm horrified to feel him unzip the top of my dress , all the way down to my bra strap ."
"he spreads his fingers across my back and a sickening feeling spreads through my body with them ."
"`` brynn , you have such a beautiful body ."
"you should n't be with someone who treats you with less respect than you deserve . ''"
"his fingertips just touch the top of my bra strap ."
"`` pierce ! ''"
"i exclaim , and jump up ."
"`` i really do n't think this is appropriate , '' i admonish him with as much confidence as i can muster , while reaching behind myself to pull my zipper up ."
"`` brynn , i 'm just trying to look out for you ."
"you clearly need a father figure in your life . ''"
"`` i 'm just fine , thank you very much , '' i reply shortly , glaring at him as i manage to zip my dress ."
"i march to the door , taking a deep breath to compose myself as i walk through the door ."
"i walk right past my desk and into the bathroom , quickly locking myself inside a stall ."
"i lower the toilet seat and sit down , pressing my hands onto my burning cheeks ."
"i know pierce 's words were saying one thing , but his actions , his touch , were saying quite another ."
"it just felt wrong ."
"by the time i sit back down at my desk , i 'm already second-guessing myself ."
"maybe i misread his behavior ; maybe he was just trying to look out for me , but he 's never had a daughter , so he did n't realize he was making me uncomfortable ."
"`` you ok ? ''"
"constance asks over her shoulder ."
"`` i 'm fine , '' i reply , pushing my uneaten cupcake away ."
"i 'm not hungry anymore ."
"i manage to make it through the rest of the work day , though i know that i 'll just have to see pierce at home for dinner ."
"as i drive home , i wonder if i should say i 'm sick or something so i 'll be able to just be by myself in my room ."
"but as i walk in through the garage , my mom calls me into the kitchen ."
"i carefully spread my hair over my neck to hide the bruises , then walk in ."
"`` oh , brynn , honey , i 'm so glad you 're home ."
"come look , '' she gushes , pulling me into the dining room ."
"i see that she 's set it with fine china and crystal , and a massive vase of white lilies sits in the center ."
"`` i thought i 'd do something a little special tonight to celebrate ."
"what do you think ? ''"
"`` looks great , mom , '' i reply half-heartedly ."
"if she notices my downtrodden mood , she does n't mention it , she just sweeps me back into the kitchen to show me the extravagant meal she 's spent the day preparing ."
"when pierce comes home about half an hour later , he quickly enters his study , calling to us that he has to make a quick call ."
"my mom asks me to carry the roasted duck out on a silver tray , and i acquiesce , knowing i 'd feel too guilty to fake sick when she 's spent so much time on the food ."
"when i walk back into the kitchen , pierce is murmuring into my mom 's ear as she blushes , so i quickly back out again ."
"i hear nate enter through the front door , and he walks into the dining room just as i 'm leaning on the back of my chair ."
"`` hey , '' he says with a smile ."
"`` i was thinking about you- '' he breaks off as my mom and pierce walk in ."
"pierce brandishes a bottle of champagne and walks around filling up our crystal flutes ."
"i step back to give him a wide berth , and then we all sit down as he finishes filling up his own glass ."
"`` cheers , '' he says ."
"i avoid his eye contact as we all clink our glasses ."
"nate frowns at me slightly and i know he can tell there 's something up ."
"oh god , i ca n't even think about talking to him later tonight ."
"he can always tell when i 'm lying , so i do n't know what i 'm going to say ."
"`` brynn , did you messenger those envelopes like i asked ? ''"
"pierce says , turning to me ."
"`` hm ? ''"
"i ask , startled by his question ."
"`` the envelopes ."
"i wanted to double check because you 've seemed so distracted lately , and they 're quite important . ''"
"i frown at him ."
"what the hell ?"
"`` you did n't ask me to messenger anything today , pierce . ''"
"`` brynn , '' he sighs in a patronizing way , setting down his champagne glass ."
"`` you did n't ! ''"
"i reply , a little more defensively than i mean to ."
"i glance at nate and see him raising his eyebrows at me ."
"`` you know that i did ."
"and it 's not like this is the first time this has happened , '' pierce counters ."
"`` maybe we should- '' my mom breaks in ."
"`` wait , no , '' i say to her , holding up my hand ."
"`` i honestly do n't know what you 're talking about pierce . ''"
"`` well , this clearly is n't the time to discuss it , but since you 're pressing me , i 've heard from some of your immediate superiors that you have n't been very responsible . ''"
"`` what ?"
"like who ?"
"when ? ''"
"`` obviously i ca n't give you exact dates , and i need to protect their anonymity- '' `` wow ."
"wow , '' i snap , tossing down my napkin ."
"`` you are just making all this up , are n't you ? ''"
"`` brynn , calm down , '' nate murmurs from across the table ."
"`` calm down ?"
"seriously ?"
"he 's lying ! ''"
"`` he has no reason to- '' nate argues ."
"`` he damn well does ."
"he called me into his office today and unzipped my dress , and i told him to back off , and now he 's pissed . ''"
"`` you know that 's because i was worried about those bruises on your neck , brynn ."
"do n't get hysterical . ''"
"`` you 're a liar , '' i whisper ."
"he slams his hand down on the table , causing me to jump ."
"`` i will not be spoken to that way in my own house ! ''"
"i glance back and forth at my mom and nate , speechless ."
"are they really just going to sit there staring at me ?"
"i stand up so abruptly that my chair almost falls over backward ."
"i ca n't take being surrounded by this bullshit anymore ."
"i walk quickly around the table and then out the front door , clenching my fists to try to contain my anger until i 'm outside ."
"as i close the door behind me , i pick up my pace , walking straight down the driveway and out of the gates ."
"the woods rise up quiet and dark around me as tears of frustration and humiliation begin to stream down my face ."
"i do n't know where i 'm going-i just need to get away from that house ."
"`` hey !"
"wait ! ''"
"i hear a woman 's voice call out behind me , but i keep walking ."
"`` you 're brynn , right ? ''"
"i freeze and take a deep breath before turning around ."
"`` look , if you 're a reporter or something , i 'm really not in the mood . ''"
"i can just see her blonde hair reflect the moonlight as she takes a couple steps closer ."
"`` i 'm not a reporter ."
"i 'm nate 's mom , eileen . ''"
"chapter twenty-five `` are ... are you alright ? ''"
"she asks , taking another step toward me ."
"`` i 'm , i 'm just- '' i break off as a sob escapes my lips ."
"`` i 'm sorry . ''"
"`` it 's alright ."
"i 've got some tissues in my car-why do n't you come sit down for a moment . ''"
"i nod ."
"in a saner moment , i might have questioned the safety of getting into a strange woman 's car , but this is not a sane moment ."
"she wraps her arm around my shoulders and leads me to the passenger side of her blue sedan , parked just down the street from the gates of the house ."
"she sits me down then hurries around to the driver 's side and gets in ."
"`` here you go , '' she says , pulling a box of tissues from the floor of the back seat ."
"`` thanks , '' i murmur rather incoherently ."
"she flips on the car 's overhead light ."
"`` oh ! ''"
"i exclaim ."
"`` you 're the woman from the boathouse parking lot . ''"
"she smiles wryly ."
"`` i thought you saw me that day ."
"i 'm not a stalker or anything ."
"it 's just , sometimes i like to get a glimpse of him , that 's all ."
"see what he looks like , how he 's doing . ''"
"`` i understand . ''"
"`` but what 's happened to you ?"
"is there anything i can do ? ''"
"`` it 's pierce , '' i murmur as more tears fall from my eyes at the mention of his name ."
"`` what 'd he do now ? ''"
"`` he ... he made a pass at me at work ."
"i mean , i actually was n't sure that 's what it was right after , but then tonight he got on my case about something i did n't even do , and that 's when i knew for sure . ''"
"`` oh , sweetie , i 'm sorry , '' she says , rubbing my shoulder ."
"`` pierce has a serious case of entitlement ."
"he thinks that anything with a vagina is fair game , even his stepdaughter , it seems . ''"
"`` i mean , i already knew he was an asshole from the way he treats nate , but i just had n't felt it directed at me yet . ''"
"she stills ."
"`` he does n't treat nate well ? ''"
"she asks quietly ."
"`` oh , oh , i 'm sorry , '' i reply , looking at her through bleary eyes ."
"`` he 's ... he 's very hard on nate ."
"he calls him entitled , selfish , when i think those are really things he knows deep down are true about himself . ''"
"`` my little nate , '' she murmurs to herself ."
"`` but he 's really ... nate is a good person , you should know that ."
"well , to be honest , at first i thought he was more like pierce , but that 's just a cover ."
"maybe it 's that half his genes are yours , or maybe his father raised him to be a better person than he is himself , i do n't know ."
"but he 's smart , funny , hardworking ... '' `` thank you , '' she says , taking my hand ."
"`` i 'm sorry you have to go through this ."
"did you tell your mom ? ''"
"`` she found out at dinner , but ... '' i shake my head ."
"`` she 's completely under pierce 's spell ."
"she gets like that about men , but i 've never seen her quite so enamored of one before him ."
"she looks a lot like you , actually , '' i realize , studying her beautiful , slightly lined face ."
"`` pierce certainly has a type , '' she says with a sad smile ."
"`` there 's another thing you should know ... about nate ... i found out after you called : he thinks you left because he was too much for you , because he was a bad kid , basically ."
"i tried to talk to him about it , really , but he would n't hear it . ''"
"`` nate was a wonderful child , and even if he 'd been the devil incarnate , i still would n't have left him . ''"
"`` yeah , i figured as much ."
"he said that the night before you left , you and pierce had a big fight over him , because he misbehaved , and that 's why you left the next day . ''"
"`` oh , god , '' she murmurs , covering her face in her hands ."
"`` he must have felt so alone , so responsible ."
"no ... i remember that fight , because it was our last ."
"we 'd been to some big gala that night , and we 'd seen this woman there who was in our circle at the time ."
"i knew he 'd cheated before , but he promised me he 'd stopped , and then at this party , i could just tell by the way they looked at each other that they were sleeping together ."
"i confronted him about it at home , and he barely even bothered to deny it ."
"i was yelling at him , asking what kind of example he was setting for his son ."
"i left ... i never thought that would be one of the last times i 'd see nate ."
"i never thought that was even a possibility . ''"
"`` i want to help you , '' i say suddenly ."
"`` what ?"
"no ."
"you have too much going on already , '' eileen says , shaking her head emphatically ."
"`` no , i want to ."
"not just for you , either ."
"for nate ."
"he needs you in his life ."
"i can tell that you 're good , and kind , and he needs people like that to love him ."
"please let me help you . ''"
"`` i do n't want to put you in a position ... i do n't want to jeopardize anything ."
"you and nate , you have a special relationship . ''"
"`` um , sure , yeah , he 's a great guy , '' i hedge ."
"`` brynn ... it 's ok ."
"i know . ''"
"i swallow ."
"`` know what ? ''"
"`` when i saw you that day at the boathouse , i could just tell ."
"at first i thought you were his girlfriend , and then i realized who you were , and i saw the way you two looked at each other ."
"you 're in love , '' she whispers ."
"i begin to tug at my hair nervously ."
"shit ."
"shit ."
"`` you 've acted on your feelings ? ''"
"it 's all i can do to nod ."
"`` do your parents know ? ''"
"i shake my head ."
"`` brynn , you do n't have to be embarrassed ."
"life 's messy ."
"people find love wherever they can ."
"hell , it 's not like you 're breaking any laws . ''"
"my tears begin to slip down my face again , renewed ."
"`` i ca n't believe it 's so obvious . ''"
"`` maybe i just caught you two in an unguarded moment ."
"but , see , if nate and you are together , i do n't want to come between you . ''"
"`` honestly , i 'd like him to meet you ."
"i think it might do him some good ."
"when pierce was chewing me out tonight , he did n't say anything . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry . ''"
"`` so you 'll meet with him ? ''"
"`` if you 're sure it 's ok with you . ''"
"`` i 'm not sure how i 'll set it up yet , but write down your number for me , and i 'll get in touch with you when i know . ''"
"she nods and tears a slip of paper from a paperback book in the back seat ."
"as she hands it to me and i get out of the car , she leans over into the passenger seat ."
"`` brynn , if i could just give you a little advice ... i would avoid pierce for the next few days ."
"he does n't like it when people stand up to him . ''"
"i nod and shut the door , walking slowly back to the house as i run my fingers over her phone number ."
"i peer cautiously through the first floor windows , not wanting to walk back in on dinner , but it looks like they 've finished and the plates have all been cleared ."
"i quietly open the front door and tiptoe up the stairs to my bedroom , locking my door behind me ."
"i put eileen 's phone number on my bureau and am just about to change out of my dress when i hear a soft knock on the door ."
"usually nate just comes in now , so he clearly knows that i 'm upset with him ."
"i walk over and unlock it , then open it a few inches ."
"`` you locked it ? ''"
"he asks , looking hurt ."
"`` i want to be alone right now , '' i murmur , though a knot forms in my throat at the thought of spending the first night in a week without him ."
"`` i ... i ca n't choose between you , '' he whispers ."
"he looks so forlorn , and i see a glimpse of the little boy that he once was , overhearing his parents ' arguments ."
"`` i know . ''"
"`` they 're going to some charity lunch tomorrow afternoon ... maybe we could spend some time together . ''"
"`` ok , '' i nod , my mind already moving in a different direction ."
"he pauses , unsure if he should kiss me ."
"`` alright , goodnight , '' he says , and walks down the hallway to his bedroom ."
"i close and lock the door after him , then grab my cell phone and put in eileen 's number ."
"tomorrow afternoon , i text her ."
"i 'll let you know when my parents are gone , and then you come meet nate ."
"chapter twenty-six i yawn as i sit by my window , waiting for the sounds of my mom and pierce leaving ."
"i was n't able to sleep well at all last night ."
"there were too many worries rattling around in my brain ."
"mainly , though , it felt strange not to see nate ."
"i missed his presence in my bed with a physical ache that gnawed away at me ."
"finally i hear some movement in the rest of the house ."
"i walk to my door and crack it open , sticking my head out into the hall ."
"i can just hear my mom murmuring something to pierce as they make their way to the garage ."
"soon i hear the car pulling out of the driveway and i glance at the clock ."
"i 'll give them ten minutes ."
"i wait impatiently , and as soon as it 's up , i text eileen and head down to the foyer ."
"luckily nate has been safely ensconced in his room all morning ."
"i do n't know if he even got up to train this morning , which is highly unusual for him ."
"i glance out the window next to the door and see eileen walking up the driveway ."
"`` hi , '' i murmur quietly as she reaches the steps and i open the door ."
"`` hi , '' she replies nervously , smoothing her blouse ."
"`` do i look alright ? ''"
"`` you look fine , '' i assure her ."
"i ca n't imagine how she must feel , finally seeing her son face-to-face after all these years ."
"she looks around the foyer ."
"`` god , this place is even bigger than it looks from outside . ''"
"`` i know ."
"it 's ridiculous , '' i agree , and usher her into the den ."
"`` pierce and my mom are at some charity lunch , so they 'll be gone for a while , '' i tell her ."
"she bites her lip nervously and takes a seat on the couch ."
"`` i 'll call nate down , alright ?"
"i have n't told him anything ... i was n't sure he would come otherwise . ''"
"she nods , and i head to the stairs ."
"`` hey , nate ? ''"
"i yell , and hear his bedroom door open ."
"`` you wan na come down to the den ? ''"
"i feel a fissure of guilt as he replies happily , `` sure !"
"be right there , '' and i hear him moving around ."
"i do n't like the idea of setting a trap and lying to him , but i rationalize that it 's in the service of a greater truth , that of the true nature of his parents ' relationship , and his father 's character ."
"i walk back into the den , and stand nervously next to the couch where eileen 's sitting ."
"she stands as we hear nate walking down the stairs , and then he turns the corner and sees us ."
"his face is a blank as he surveys the scene before him ."
"he takes a step forward , looks like he 's going to say something , and then steps back ."
"`` nate , it 's me , your mom , '' eileen whispers ."
"`` i know who you are , '' nate replies quietly ."
"he turns to me ."
"`` you did this ? ''"
"`` i think you should hear what she has to say ."
"please , will you just sit for a minute ? ''"
"nate 's face twists into a sneer-an expression i have n't seen in weeks ."
"`` you 're unbelievable , '' he spits at me , and storms out the front door , slamming it behind him ."
"eileen sits down with a muted cry , and i run after him ."
"`` nate ! ''"
"i call as i shut the door behind me and head down the front steps ."
"he 's walking around the side of the house , probably headed for the garage and his car to make an escape ."
"`` would you just listen to me for a second ? ''"
"`` why ?"
"so you can try to poison my mind against my dad some more ? ''"
"he yells , reeling around ."
"`` i 'm trying to tell you the truth about him !"
"eileen can tell you- '' `` oh , so this is all about you !"
"you can try to paint it as some benevolent way of getting a mother and son to reunite , but really , this is all about getting me to believe your story , '' he turns again and begins to walk away across the grass ."
"`` no !"
"that 's not true ! ''"
"i protest , pursuing him ."
"`` your mom is a good person-i wanted to help her , and you . ''"
"`` you 're pathetic , you know that ? ''"
"he says , spinning around again ."
"`` stop following me ."
"whatever mistakes we made together this summer , it 's over . ''"
"`` what ?"
"nate , i- '' i feel like he just punched me in the gut ."
"how did this all go so wrong ?"
"`` i thought maybe you were different than all the other girls i 've fucked , but you 're not , ok ?"
"from now on , let 's just smile at each other politely from across the room at family events , like normal stepsiblings do . ''"
"`` no , no !"
"we are different , we are . ''"
"`` you 're just attached because i was your first ."
"do n't worry about it , you 'll get over it soon ."
"you were nothing special to me , brynn , '' he says and walks through the garage 's side door ."
"i stand in shock as i watch the garage door slide open and his wrangler come speeding out ."
"i watch him head down the driveway , then disappear around the corner ."
"i hear the front door open behind me , and eileen approach me ."
"`` i 'm so sorry , brynn , this is all my fault . ''"
"`` no , it 's not , '' i reply , biting my lip to keep from sobbing ."
"she puts her arm around me ."
"`` he 's just angry ."
"he 'll come to his senses . ''"
"`` no , he 's just as stubborn as i am ."
"it 's really over . ''"
"i collapse against her , burying my head on her shoulder as i begin to cry ."
"`` first love always hits the hardest , '' she murmurs as she rubs my arm ."
"`` come on-your parents wo n't be back for a while ."
"i 'll make you some tea . ''"
"after eileen leaves and i 've hidden away in my room , i ca n't help but marvel at her kindness ."
"it 's been a long time since my own mother has taken care of me and comforted me the way she did , even though the afternoon might have gone even worse for her than it did for me ."
"she told me that she 's learned not to get her hopes up for a reunion over the years , though it does still hurt ."
"i keep picturing the anger on nate 's face as he ended our romantic relationship ."
"i could tell he really meant the things he was saying ."
"my body aches at the thought that i wo n't get to touch him again , and feel him against me ."
"already i feel like it 's been ages since i 've seen him ."
"i hear my mom and pierce come home in the late afternoon , and i glance at my locked door ."
"i do n't want to see them now , or anytime soon , for that matter ."
"i think of how nate begins to resemble his father when he gets angry , but his mother in his kindness ."
"even though she was only in his life until he was eight or nine , she must have had some influence on him in those early years , in addition to whatever good traits she passed down to him genetically ."
"i suppose i wanted to tip the scales in her direction , to make sure that nate keeps listening to the side of himself that his mother has passed on to him ."
"but clearly , i do n't have the power to make such a thing happen ."
"mistake ."
"he referred to what happened between us as a mistake ."
"my body curls around myself as though i 've just been punched in the gut ."
"i can feel the pain reverberating in my bones ."
"i thought maybe you were different than all the other girls i 've fucked , but you 're not ."
"you 're nothing special to me , brynn ."
"his words keep echoing around in my head , and i ca n't make them go away ."
"i do n't know if i 've ever felt so completely hollow before ."
"eventually , i fall asleep , my body finally giving in to the exhaustion i feel ."
"when i wake up , it 's almost ten at night ."
"my mom did n't even try to wake me for dinner , i realize ."
"i feel a surge of anger against her ."
"mothers are supposed to protect their children , but of course she 's taking pierce 's side ."
"she thinks he 's some kind of savior , rescuing her and her abandoned daughter from some lonely life ."
"i want to scream ."
"i want her to be stronger , to be there for me like i 've been there for her countless times ."
"but i know my anger is useless ; i 've long ago realized that i ca n't change her , ca n't expect her to be any different from the way that she is ."
"my stomach grumbles , reminding me that i 've skipped a meal or two today ."
"i do n't even feel like eating , but i know that i 'll never be able to get to sleep again tonight without a little something in my stomach ."
"i sigh and get out of bed and head over to my bureau , pulling a sweatshirt on over my t-shirt ."
"i cautiously open my door and listen ."
"i think i can just hear the sounds of the tv from my mom and pierce 's room ."
"should be safe , then ."
"i tiptoe down the hallway , pausing at the open door to nate 's dark room ."
"still out , i guess ."
"probably drinking somewhere ."
"how long can this situation last ?"
"i wonder as i walk quietly down the stairs ."
"i feel like we 're all tightly-wound strings , and one of us is bound to break sometime ."
"i know i for one ca n't keep creeping around the house like this , avoiding everyone ."
"in the kitchen , i fix myself a grilled cheese sandwich , feeling the need for some comfort food ."
"i 'm just turning off the stove top when i hear the door to pierce 's study open ."
"i hurry to grab the spatula and slide the sandwich onto my plate before he comes in , but i 'm too late ."
"`` brynn , '' he says from the doorway ."
"`` we missed you at dinner . ''"
"ugh , that asshole , acting like nothing happened ."
"`` just fixing something now , '' i answer shortly ."
"as i put the spatula and pan into the sink , i see over my shoulder that he 's walking toward me ."
"he plants himself between the island and the fridge , trapping me by the counter ."
"`` your mother is very upset , '' he tells me , his eyebrow bending into a concerned frown ."
"`` is she ? ''"
"i ask through gritted teeth ."
"if he expects me to apologize , as though her mood is my fault , then he 's mistaken ."
"`` brynn , i think you 've gotten the wrong idea about me , '' he murmurs , taking another step toward me ."
"i reluctantly turn to face him ."
"`` you have no idea how hard it is for a man , to have a beautiful woman like you in the house . ''"
"`` i 'm your stepdaughter , pierce , '' i practically growl as my heartbeat jumps in my chest ."
"`` you 've really blossomed this summer , brynn ."
"you 've become a woman , '' he says , stepping into me ."
"i can feel his warm breath on my face ."
"`` i want you to get away from me , '' i whisper , my throat tightening ."
"`` just for a moment ... i need to feel ... '' he moans pitifully , sliding his hand onto my hip and then over my ass ."
"my anger ignites at his touch , blasting away my fear ."
"i get my arms up between us and shove him away ."
"`` get off me , you fucking asshole ! ''"
"i scream ."
"he looks at me in shock ."
"`` you think you 're some gentleman with your fancy suits and your mansion , but inside you 're just some sick pervert , taking advantage of anyone you can ."
"i see who you really are , even if no one else does . ''"
"his face twists with anger , and i feel my cheek light up with pain before my brain can process that he 's slapped me ."
"i bring my hand up to my burning face , my head still pulled to the side , just as pierce disappears in a blur ."
"i straighten up with a gasp as i realize nate has just tackled him to the floor , and they are now grappling fiercely on the kitchen tiles ."
"`` do n't you fucking touch her ! ''"
"he yells at his father , whose face is turning red in an effort to defend himself against his much stronger son ."
"i hear footsteps from the stairwell and see my mom running down the hallway and manage to unfreeze myself ."
"`` nate !"
"nate , stop ! ''"
"i yell , as he manages to find the top position ."
"my mom screams as nate punches pierce hard across his jaw ."
"i throw myself on nate 's back as he cocks his arm back in preparation for another punch ."
"`` nate , i 'm ok , i 'm ok , '' i repeat in his ear ."
"i feel him relax a little and begin to pull him up ."
"he drops his arm and stands up with me ."
"pierce pushes him away as he stands up , too , and they face off , each breathing heavily , pierce with a trail of blood dripping from the corner of his mouth ."
"`` what 's going on ? ''"
"my mom finally whispers , her voice full of fear ."
"`` i saw everything , '' nate growls , addressing his father ."
"`` you hypocrite . ''"
"to my shock , pierce begins to laugh ."
"`` i knew it , i knew it !"
"look at you two ! ''"
"he says , pointing at us ."
"`` what 's he talking about ? ''"
"my mom asks , glancing at me ."
"`` they 're fucking ! ''"
"pierce bursts out ."
"`` no ... what ? ''"
"my mom murmurs ."
"`` oh , christ , holly , are you really that fucking stupid ?"
"you did n't even suspect ? ''"
"my mom shakes her head ."
"`` that 's why you 're fighting ? ''"
"`` no , '' nate says , turning to her ."
"`` i saw him trying to feel up brynn , and then she told him to stop , and he slapped her . ''"
"a look of horror spreads across my mom 's face ."
"she looks at me , then at pierce ."
"`` is this true ?"
"is it true ? ''"
"pierce does n't even bother responding to her accusations , just turns his palms upward and shrugs ."
"a wailing cry escapes my mom 's lips ."
"for a second i think she 's going to collapse , but then she throws herself at pierce , her limbs a blur as she attacks him ."
"`` i trusted you !"
"i trusted you ! ''"
"she screams ."
"pierce puts his arms up to defend himself as nate steps forward and wraps his arms around her , hemming her in and then pulling her away ."
"`` my own daughter !"
"my own daughter , you son of a bitch ! ''"
"with a strangled cry , she turns her head and begins to sob against nate 's chest ."
"pierce surveys the three of us , aligned against him on the other side of the kitchen ."
"`` nothing ? ''"
"nate whispers , as he rubs my mom 's shoulder ."
"`` you have nothing to say for yourself ? ''"
"`` come on , nate ."
"you 're really going to believe them ? ''"
"pierce says , a sneer of contempt on his face ."
"`` i do n't have to-i saw you with my own eyes ."
"but i should have believed brynn in the first place , '' nate says quietly , though i can hear the strength in his voice ."
"pierce can only manage a snort of derision before he walks toward the hallway ."
"`` my mother , '' nate says , and pierce stops , his back still toward his son ."
"`` you made everything up , did n't you ? ''"
"pierce stands frozen for a moment , his head slightly cocked to the side ."
"i ca n't see his face , and ca n't imagine what could be going on inside his mind ."
"his carefully crafted history , now falling apart around him ."
"he shakes his head slightly , as if waving away an unpleasant smell , then continues to walk down the hallway ."
"he heads straight to the front door , and shuts it behind him ."
"as we hear the sound of his car heading down the driveway , my mom straightens up , and nate 's arms fall to his sides ."
"`` i need to be alone for a little while , '' she murmurs , her gaze on the floor , and walks unsteadily toward the stairs ."
"i watch her leave , wishing she had the strength to comfort me for even a moment ."
"`` she 's just in shock , '' nate says , reading my mind like always ."
"`` i know , '' i reply with a nod , struggling to keep myself together ."
"`` i should have believed you . ''"
"`` i had no reason to lie . ''"
"`` i know ."
"i just could n't believe he was capable of that kind of thing , or maybe i did n't want to believe . ''"
"`` you said some awful things to me today ."
"god , was that just today ? ''"
"i ask with a sad laugh , reaching up to rub my forehead ."
"`` i 'm so sorry , brynn ."
"i was angry ... sometimes my temper ... i did n't mean any of those things ."
"the time we 've spent together- '' he says , taking a step toward me ."
"`` no , no ."
"i 'm not ready for that ."
"i do n't know if we can go back ... '' i murmur , a tear slipping down my face ."
"`` brynn , please , i ca n't lose you . ''"
"`` you were so ready to turn on me , '' i whisper ."
"`` so ready to push me away and be done with me . ''"
"`` i was in shock at seeing her again ."
"i did n't actually mean it . ''"
"`` but you said it , did n't you ?"
"the way i care about you ... i would never treat you that way , would never want you to hurt ."
"but you wanted me to hurt ."
"you do n't feel the way about me that i feel about you ."
"you ca n't . ''"
"`` that 's not true !"
"you have no idea how much i care about- '' `` i love you . ''"
"there 's a long silence ."
"i stare up into his beautiful face , my heart shattering as he does n't reply ."
"he just looks back down at me , some unknowable emotion flickering across his eyes ."
"`` well , there you go ."
"there you go ."
"goodbye , nate , '' i say , turning my back to him ."
"he does n't move ."
"`` what are you going to do ? ''"
"he finally asks quietly ."
"`` um , well , '' i begin with a cold laugh ."
"`` i think i 'm going to eat this cold grilled cheese sandwich , and then i 'm going to start packing . ''"
"chapter twenty-seven i survey my mom 's old beat-up station wagon ."
"both the car and our old house were just on the verge of being sold , but my mom was able to back out ."
"luckily she was taking her time in the process because she did n't think she had to worry about money anymore ."
"the car is n't even full-the only things that belonged to us here were our clothes and some knick-knacks ."
"it only took me a few hours this morning to pack it up ."
"it 's both sad and comforting ."
"our old life is still waiting for us , almost as though this whole summer never happened ."
"but of course it did ."
"i wondered last night if i would take these last few months back if i could ."
"if i were given a magic wand that could make it so that my mom had never met pierce , that i 'd returned to our old house for the summer , that my relationship with nate had never gone beyond that encounter in the crew house , would i wave it ?"
"i do n't know if i 've ever felt so much pain as i have recently , but also never so much happiness ."
"i was held in such a tight little shell before , never really experiencing the depths or heights of anything , and i suppose you ca n't have one without the other ."
"to never have held nate in my arms ... no , i ca n't imagine it ."
"despite so many terrible things having happened , i would never want to erase the time i spent with him , even if it would take away the pain i 'm feeling right now ."
"the pain that i can feel even in my bones , causing a throbbing ache throughout my whole body ."
"it 's like i 'm detoxing from some powerful , addictive substance ."
"one that i know only hurts me in the end ."
"i catch a glimpse of my slightly swollen lip in the car window from where pierce hit me last night ."
"we have n't seen him today-he must be holed up at a friend 's house or a hotel ."
"i do n't even want to think of the divorce proceedings that my mom will be wrapped up in now ."
"i hear the front door shut behind me and turn-will it be nate coming to say goodbye ?"
"but it 's my mom , carrying one last small suitcase , her eyes covered in large , round sunglasses ."
"`` ready ? ''"
"she asks , without looking at me ."
"i nod , then remember one last thing i 've forgotten ."
"`` i 'll be right back , '' i say , and hurry in through the front door without explanation ."
"i walk straight up the staircase and down the hall into my bedroom ."
"it looks exactly the same as the first time i saw it ."
"i pause for a moment , taking in the beauty of the furnishings for the last time , before walking over to my desk and opening the top drawer ."
"i reach my arm all the way to the back and fish out the small slip of paper i stashed there ."
"i walk out and down the hallway ."
"nate 's bedroom door is slightly open and i can tell from the silence that he 's not inside ."
"i push it open all the way and walk to his bed ."
"i run my hand over his bedspread and breathe in his smell ."
"i pull down the comforter and lay the piece of paper on top of his pillow , then pull the comforter back up over it ."
"i certainly do n't want pierce to find the scrap of paper where eileen wrote her phone number ."
"i 'm about to leave when something makes me cross over to his window overlooking the river ."
"my eye catches on a flash of white on the lower lawn : nate sitting on the top step of the stairs leading down to the rocky shore ."
"he sits completely still , his white t-shirt stretched across his broad back ."
"i resist the urge to wonder what he 'll do now-it 's really none of my business anymore ."
"i hurry back down to the car and see my mom sitting in the passenger seat ."
"i open the driver 's door and see that she 's placed the keys on the seat ."
"i get in without a word and turn the car on then pull away from the house ."
"i glance in the rearview mirror to get one last glimpse at it as i turn the corner out of the gate ."
"my mom is silent on our drive back to our old house , just staring out the window as we get on the highway that takes us further away from the city , back to our much less expensive neighborhood ."
"a seed of resentment that 's been building inside of me all summer , or perhaps longer , finally takes root as i glance sidelong at her impassive face ."
"`` you have n't even looked at me all day , '' i finally say , gripping the steering wheel with white-knuckled hands ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"she asks faintly , still not turning to me ."
"`` you have n't looked at my face , '' i repeat ."
"`` brynn ... '' she sighs ."
"`` no , it 's true ."
"your husband slapped me last night and you never even came to check on me ."
"and now you wo n't look at the bruise . ''"
"`` brynn , i 've been very upset . ''"
"`` and i have n't ?"
"he feels me up , hits me , and you have n't asked me if i 'm ok. '' `` it 's not my fault that he did those things ! ''"
"she shouts , suddenly hysterical ."
"`` mom , i 'm not blaming you for his actions , alright ?"
"but you 're my mother ."
"you should have believed me-you should have taken care of me ."
"i 've been taking care of you for years , and this time , i needed you . ''"
"my mom sobs once , reaching up to cover her mouth with her hand ."
"`` i wanted to believe you , brynn , i really did , '' she finally gasps ."
"`` i just knew that if i did , everything would fall apart , and it all seemed so perfect . ''"
"`` but it was n't . ''"
"`` no , it was n't . ''"
"i feel her hand reach up tentatively to touch my face , and her fingers graze over the small cut in the corner of my mouth ."
"`` oh , i 'm so sorry , my darling ."
"does it hurt much ? ''"
"`` hardly at all , '' i reply , swallowing the tears that have sprung up at her touch ."
"`` i never guessed ... about you and nate , i mean , '' she whispers ."
"`` that 's over , too , '' i reply shortly as my emotions threaten to overwhelm me ."
"`` ah , '' is all she says ."
"`` well , i know that might not be the kind of thing you ever want to talk about with your mother , but i 'm here ."
"you cared about him a lot ? ''"
"`` yes , '' i answer , my voice raspy with held emotion ."
"`` so i guess you have to get a lawyer ? ''"
"i ask , changing the subject ."
"`` oh , god ."
"i suppose so , '' she replies ."
"`` i think i 'll be able to get my old job at the salon back , at least ."
"i talked to anita and she said the new girl they got is terrible . ''"
"`` did you sign a pre-nup ? ''"
"i ask , thinking of eileen ."
"i know i 'll have to fill my mom in on what i know about her soon , but it would just be too much for me right now ."
"`` yes , '' she sighs ."
"`` iron-clad . ''"
"chapter twenty-eight i close the door behind me and dump my newly-purchased textbooks on my thin mattress , then straighten up to survey my lawn room ."
"it 's not much to look at , with its sparse furnishings and lack of bathroom access , though it does have a framed list of every inhabitant that 's lived here , going back to uva 's very first class ."
"for the last month , i 've just been sitting around our old house , doing my best to help my mom with getting her old job back and hiring a lawyer , but there really was n't much for me to do ."
"i felt both relief and fear when it was finally time to drive back down to charlottesville ."
"relief because i 'll have schoolwork to occupy my mind , and fear because i might run into nate on campus ."
"foolishly , i had hoped that he would try to get in touch with me after my mom and i moved out , but he did n't ."
"it really was stupid of me ."
"i told him that i loved him , and he did n't say it back ."
"simple as that ."
"even though he was angry , there must have been some truth to his words when he told me i was n't special to him ."
"i glance at the clock ."
"just after four-almost time for my dinner shift in the cafeteria to be starting ."
"i change into my work clothes and head over ."
"at least i know i wo n't run into nate there-the athletes all have a separate dining hall serving far tastier and more nutritious food ."
"i open my door to the lawn , smiling halfheartedly at another female student a few doors down as she exits her room at the same time ."
"i walk quickly , keeping my head down , not really wanting to interact with anyone i know ."
"i enter the dining hall and cross around to the side door , back into the kitchen ."
"`` oh , brynn ! ''"
"roberta , my manager , waves to me from a table by the front , where she 's doing some paperwork ."
"i wave back and head over ."
"`` there 's been some issue with your work-study , '' she tells me quietly as i reach her ."
"`` an issue ? ''"
"i ask frowning ."
"`` do you know what it is ? ''"
"`` something related to your scholarship-that 's all the dean 's office told me when they called . ''"
"i rub my forehead in frustration ."
"this is the last thing i need ."
"`` if you head over to monroe hall now , you might be able to talk to someone who knows more than i do . ''"
"i nod ."
"`` sorry , '' she adds , before continuing with her work ."
"i hurry out of the dining hall and follow roberta 's advice to see if i can get some more answers , though i fear i already know what happened ."
"my mom has been so frazzled lately , i bet she forgot to make a payment on the portion of the tuition that we still owe ."
"i explain the situation to a secretary at monroe , who points me toward the office in charge of the work-study program ."
"a man in his early thirties stands to greet me as i walk through the open door of his office ."
"`` francis delton , '' he introduces himself , shaking my hand ."
"`` how can i help you ? ''"
"`` well , i was told there 's some issue with my work-study program , or with my scholarship , or something , '' i reply , reaching to tug at my hair before realizing it 's pulled up in a ponytail ."
"`` ok , your name ? ''"
"he asks , sitting down and motioning me into the chair across from him ."
"`` brynn atwell , '' i respond , spelling it out for him ."
"he types my name into his computer and then clicks around for a moment ."
"`` ah , this is quite unusual , '' he says , raising his eyebrows at his screen ."
"`` ok ... '' i reply nervously ."
"`` you can no longer participate in the work-study program , because your tuition has been paid in full . ''"
"i stare at him ."
"`` you mean , for this semester ? ''"
"`` no , i mean all of your tuition . ''"
"i shake my head , unable to believe him ."
"`` for this year ?"
"or ... i mean , not all all ? ''"
"he smiles ."
"`` all all . ''"
"`` but that 's ... that 's impossible ."
"how ?"
"who ? ''"
"i stammer ."
"`` i have no idea ."
"i can only see that you 're ineligible for the program . ''"
"`` ok , ok , '' i reply , trying to gather my thoughts ."
"`` thank you ."
"thank you so much . ''"
"i wander out of his office and out onto the quad ."
"with pierce and my mom getting divorced , i knew i 'd have college tuition loans to deal with again , and i took it in stride ."
"i was used to the idea , anyway ."
"what the hell 's going on ?"
"i reach into my back pocket and dial my mom ."
"i have no idea if she 'll know either , but i can at least tell her the good news ."
"`` oh , brynn !"
"brynn , i was just going to call you ! ''"
"she says as she picks up ."
"`` let me guess , is it about my tuition ? ''"
"i ask , hearing excitement in her voice ."
"`` yes !"
"how did you know ? ''"
"`` well , i showed up for my shift at the dining hall , and was told that my tuition 's been taken care of ."
"what 's going on ? ''"
"`` i was literally just picking up the phone to tell you ... it all happened so quickly this afternoon ."
"pierce 's lawyer offered me a settlement in the divorce !"
"and it specifically included payment of your tuition . ''"
"`` pierce paid my tuition ? ''"
"i ask , my mind reeling ."
"`` yes !"
"as soon as i signed , the money was wired over . ''"
"`` but ... but mom , was it a good settlement ?"
"i mean , did you have a lawyer look it over ? ''"
"`` yeah , it was the same lawyer who told me i 'd get nothing because of the pre-nup i signed ."
"he was completely floored , and told me i 'd better sign before pierce changes his mind . ''"
"`` but ... why ?"
"i mean , it seems so out of character for him . ''"
"`` i know !"
"i can hardly believe it either ."
"it 's crazy !"
"i 'll be able to pay off the mortgage on the house and have a little left over ."
"i mean , we 're not rich or anything , but we have a bit of leeway now . ''"
"`` was it , you know , 'hush money , ' do you think ? ''"
"`` i doubt it ."
"the lawyer said that there 's no less reliable witness than a woman trying to defame her ex-husband , so i do n't really think pierce would be worried about me going to the press with stories or anything-not that i 'd want to do that anyway ."
"but honey , it 's done now ."
"it 's really over ."
"we do n't have to worry about him anymore . ''"
"`` well , i 'm glad that you 're happy with it ."
"if you 're happy i 'm happy ."
"man , this is the first good news we 've gotten in a while , huh ? ''"
"i touch my lips with my fingertips , wondering when the last time i smiled was ."
"`` have you seen him yet ? ''"
"my mom asks quietly ."
"she does n't need to specify that she 's referring to nate ."
"`` not yet , '' i reply ."
"`` though i 've convinced myself that every brown-haired guy i 've seen from the back is him . ''"
"`` that 's normal , '' my mom assures me ."
"`` you 'll see him everywhere for a while ."
"but it will pass soon , my darling ."
"i promise . ''"
"chapter twenty-nine realizing i now have the evening off , i take a deep breath and call allison ."
"i 'm still in a daze , but i want to share my good fortune with her and miriam ."
"allison and i have n't talked since our argument over the summer , so i 'm relieved when she accepts my invitation on behalf of both of them ."
"i pick a rather fancy restaurant , and assure her that it 's my treat ."
"half an hour later , i 'm walking out of my room in a light summer dress-the weather here in virginia is still sweltering , even though it 's september ."
"i walk slowly across the quad to the off-campus restaurant , trying not to work up a sweat ."
"i watch a group of freshmen girls giggling as they head out for a group dinner ."
"new hall mates , no doubt ."
"i remember how nervous i was my first year here , worrying that i would n't make any more friends than i did in high school ."
"my insides contract as i pass the spot where i first saw nate crossing the grass , just a couple weeks into my freshman year ."
"i shake my head at myself ."
"i have to forget him ."
"when i reach the restaurant , an upscale mexican place known for its flavored margaritas , i 'm relieved to feel the ac hit me ."
"the hostess smiles at me just as i see allison sitting in a booth by herself ."
"she stands with a nervous smile and i walk over ."
"`` i hope you do n't mind , '' she murmurs as we hug awkwardly ."
"`` i sort of lied to miriam and told her you pushed back dinner by fifteen minutes so we 'd have a chance to talk . ''"
"a short bark of laughter escapes my mouth ."
"`` i do n't know if i 've ever heard you lie before . ''"
"to my surprise , she blushes as we sit down across from each other ."
"`` well , i 've been thinking about what you said ... about my being judgmental ... and maybe i am a bit of , you know , a goody two-shoes ."
"maybe i need to loosen up a little ."
"what i 'm trying to say is , i 'm sorry for what i said . ''"
"i reach over and place my hand over hers ."
"`` thanks ."
"it means a lot to hear you say that ."
"i 've hated not talking to you . ''"
"`` me too , '' she replies ."
"i see her glance over my shoulder ."
"`` and here i thought i was early ! ''"
"i hear miriam say ."
"i stand up to give her a hug ."
"`` i see you two have synced your watches , being in the same city together all summer !"
"ugh , i was so jealous ! ''"
"she sits down with a dramatic sigh in the booth next to allison , her bright red hair falling onto her shoulder ."
"`` so ."
"catch me up on everything that 's been happening . ''"
"to my horror , i begin to tear up ."
"`` oh , god , sorry , '' i murmur , reaching for a napkin ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"allison gasps ."
"the waiter walks over and is about to ask for our drink orders but they wave him away ."
"`` it 's ... it 's ... '' i grab a napkin to hide my face and try to take deep breaths ."
"`` is it a boy ? ''"
"miriam guesses ."
"i nod ."
"`` nate . ''"
"`` wait , wait ... not your stepbrother ? ''"
"she asks incredulously ."
"allison glances at me and i nod at her ."
"she turns to miriam ."
"`` they started , you know , seeing each other over the summer ... but i guess something happened , '' she fills miriam in ."
"`` long story short , '' i say , catching my breath ."
"`` pierce is a jerk , our parents got divorced , and we broke up . ''"
"`` wow , '' miriam breathes , her eyes wide ."
"`` you had quite the summer . ''"
"`` tell me about it , '' i say with a wry smile ."
"`` i could really use a drink . ''"
"allison flags down the waiter , and by the time our first round has arrived , my tears have stopped ."
"`` so , can i tell you guys my own secret ? ''"
"miriam asks , leaning over the table conspiratorially ."
"allison and i nod ."
"`` i had sex ! ''"
"`` oh , god , now i 'm the only virgin , '' allison moans ."
"`` how was it ? ''"
"`` honestly ... not that great the first time ."
"but the third time , i think i had an orgasm , '' miriam whispers ."
"`` you think ? ''"
"allison asks , cocking her head in confusion ."
"`` yeah , i think ."
"what about you , brynn ? ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"`` did you and nate ... '' she trails off suggestively ."
"`` um , yes . ''"
"`` and ? ''"
"allison leans forward ."
"my heartbeat quickens at the memory of his touch before sadness washes over me ."
"i shake my head ."
"`` i 'd rather not think about it . ''"
"i finish the rest of the dinner trying to engage in the conversation , but knowing that i 'm often forcing the smile on my face ."
"allison and miriam do their best to raise my spirits , and i try to act excited about classes starting on monday , but my mind , and my heart , are n't quite in it ."
"after i pay the bill , allison and miriam volunteer to walk me back to my room , but i demur , feeling like a walk by myself before bed ."
"after i hug them goodbye , i stroll along the edge of campus , watching all the action unfold as everyone enjoys the last weekend free of homework ."
"it 's not long before i realize my feet are leading me past the crew house ."
"just a quick look , i tell myself ."
"i begin to walk more slowly as i see it up the street ."
"the lights are on inside the house , and i can see some people hanging out on the front porch ."
"the late summer night has just darkened , and i stand under a street light peering up at the house ."
"i can see several of the crew guys up there , and a petite blonde leaning on the railing with her back toward me ."
"the front door swings open and i press my lips together as i see nate walk out with two bottles of beer in his hand ."
"he 's so close ... just across the street and up the hill , and yet i ca n't be with him , this person with whom i 've shared such intimate moments ."
"my heart stops as he smiles at the blonde ."
"it ca n't be ... he ca n't have moved on already ."
"but there he is , offering her one of the beers , and sitting down next to her on the railing and wrapping an arm around her shoulders ."
"a chill comes over me despite the warm air ."
"i really am a fool ."
"i jump as a bottle crashes on a campus path just behind me ."
"i glance up to see the denizens of the porch also looking at the source of the sound , and freeze for a moment as nate stares right at me ."
"fuck ."
"i turn around , cursing myself for walking this way ."
"i walk quickly down the street , turning right onto a path to take me into campus ."
"`` brynn ? ''"
"i hear him call out behind me , and the sound of footsteps coming down the steps ."
"i pick up my pace , hoping to lose him in the darkness ."
"i ca n't let our first meeting after breaking up be him finding me spying on his house ."
"`` brynn ! ''"
"i hear a woman 's voice yell behind me , and almost trip over my own feet in surprise ."
"`` brynn ! ''"
"she calls again , and i turn around ."
"`` eileen , '' i say in surprise as she emerges out of the darkness , slightly out of breath ."
"`` was ... was that you up there ?"
"with nate ? ''"
"she nods , a wide smile covering her face ."
"my eyes dart over his shoulder as i see nate stop by the entrance to the path ."
"`` i 'm down here visiting him for the weekend , '' she says happily ."
"`` oh , oh , '' i murmur , covering my face in embarrassment ."
"`` i 'm sorry i ran ... i thought ... i mean , from the back , i thought you and he were ... '' `` oh ! ''"
"she exclaims ."
"`` well , i suppose i 'm flattered ... i mean , i do put my time in at the gym . ''"
"she steps forward and takes my hands ."
"`` i 'm so glad to see you brynn ."
"if you had n't gotten involved , i would n't be here with nate today . ''"
"i try to blink back tears , but they roll down my cheeks anyway ."
"`` i 'm so sorry for everything you 've been through-nate told me- '' `` mom ? ''"
"nate says , stepping forward ."
"`` mind if i talk to brynn alone for a minute ? ''"
"`` of course ! ''"
"she calls over her shoulder , then turns to me ."
"`` it 's so nice to hear him call me 'mom , ' '' she says , then leans forward and whispers in my ear , `` do n't give up hope . ''"
"i blink at her in surprise as she pulls away and walks back toward nate ."
"they share a smile and a few murmured words before she continues back toward the crew house and nate approaches me ."
"`` hi , '' he murmurs as he walks up to me ."
"`` hello , '' i reply , a bit more stiffly ."
"`` i found her number where you left it , '' he explains ."
"`` we met several times while i was still up in maryland , but it hardly seemed like enough time , so she drove me back down here and is staying for a few days . ''"
"he takes a deep breath ."
"`` when you told me you loved me- '' i raise my hand to stop him ."
"`` you do n't have to explain ."
"you told me from the beginning that you did n't do relationships ... that you did n't lead girls on ."
"so i should have known ."
"i should n't have expected- '' `` brynn , please ."
"just give me two minutes , ok ? ''"
"i nod , shifting from foot to foot as i wish i could just run away , all the way back to my room and pull the covers over my head ."
"anything so that i do n't have to hear all the reasons why he does n't love me ."
"`` when you told me you loved me , '' he resumes , `` i felt empty . ''"
"tears spring to my eyes-oof , that was worse than i thought ."
"`` no , not like that ! ''"
"he says , seeing my reaction ."
"`` i mean , i felt ... inadequate ."
"like i had nothing inside me to give back to you ."
"here you were , so strong , and smart , and intelligent , and i felt like such a failure . ''"
"i 'm shocked to hear his voice break ."
"he clears his throat before he continues ."
"`` i had failed you ."
"i felt ..."
"i mean , everything my dad had ever told me was a lie ! ''"
"he exclaims , his voice rising ."
"`` in that moment , i do n't think i knew if i was capable of love ."
"what my father had shown me for years was n't love , i do n't think , it was control ."
"i felt so undeserving to be loved by you , and for me to even tell you that i loved you , it would n't mean anything , because it would be from someone who was empty . ''"
"`` you 're not empty , '' i murmur , unable to hear him talk about himself like this even though he broke my heart ."
"`` i 'm starting to realize that ."
"it 's been good , seeing my mom , talking to her , hearing the truth about my past ."
"all the things that you were trying to help me with ."
"you were right all along . ''"
"`` i was n't trying to be right . ''"
"`` i know , that 's not-sorry , this is coming out all wrong ."
"i 've been thinking about you every day , imagining us meeting up back on campus , and it 's just happened a lot quicker than i thought it would ."
"i wanted to call you every day , but i needed to make sure i was ready ."
"that i had done some work on myself before i tried to reach out to you ."
"i know the kind of relationship i want to have with you , and i want to make sure i 'm ready for it . ''"
"i blink at him , feeling confused ."
"`` so , what are you saying ? ''"
"`` i 'm saying that you 're not my stepsister anymore , first of all , '' he says with a small grin ."
"`` they filed today . ''"
"`` you talked to your dad ? ''"
"`` just once ."
"i couch-surfed with friends after you left ."
"i did n't want to stay in the same house with him . ''"
"i stare at him as a realization begins to trickle through my brain ."
"`` it was you , was n't it ?"
"you got him to give my mom a settlement . ''"
"he runs a hand through his hair ."
"`` well , after talking with my mom , and hearing what happened to her in their divorce , i was worried he would n't be fair in dealing with your mom either ."
"so , i , um , told him that if he ever wanted to see me again , he 'd have to give your mom some money in the divorce ."
"and your tuition , well , i figured after what he put you through , that you deserved it . ''"
"`` i ca n't believe you did that . ''"
"`` actually , i was n't sure it would work ."
"i mean , i was n't sure if he wanted to see me again anyway . ''"
"`` i think , in his own twisted way , he does love you . ''"
"`` his very twisted way . ''"
"he steps forward and reaches for my hand , which is still entwined in my hair ."
"he pulls it down and laces his fingers through mine ."
"`` i ca n't promise you that i 'll know how to be in a normal relationship right away , but please , give me another chance ."
"i know how badly i fucked up , but i want to do better ."
"please ."
"i want to learn with you . ''"
"i pause , uncertain ."
"can i really put myself out there with him ?"
"risk my heart being broken again ?"
"i feel him begin to pull my hand gently behind his back so that i 'm forced to take a step in ."
"he leans forward , tucking my arm against the small of his back ."
"`` no fair , '' i whisper , as the heat of his body envelopes me ."
"he wraps his other arm around me ."
"`` i know , '' he says with a sly grin ."
"`` but can you blame me ?"
"i 'd do anything for another chance with you . ''"
"everything about him is so intoxicating ."
"i 'm dizzy with desire for him after not being near him for close to a month ."
"i turn my face up to his ."
"`` ok , ok , '' i relent ."
"`` one more chance . ''"
"the words have barely left my lips when he covers my mouth with his ."
"my legs almost give out as we touch-a mix of pleasure and relief overwhelming my body ."
"`` god , i 've missed you , '' he murmurs , breaking away for a moment ."
"i pull his head back down to mine and sink my tongue into his mouth ."
"`` get a room ! ''"
"we break away as a group of guys , probably freshmen , walk past us , hooting and hollering ."
"nate glares at them for a moment , then rolls his eyes ."
"`` come on , there 's something i 've wanted to do for a long time anyway . ''"
"he leads me by the hand back out of campus and across the street to the crew house ."
"i 'm wondering if he means something sexual , and worries he forgot his mom is visiting him ."
"we walk up the steps and i see her and the crew guys turn to us as we step onto the porch ."
"`` everyone , this is my girlfriend , brynn , '' he announces proudly ."
"chapter thirty eileen 's face breaks into a huge grin as i blush ."
"his teammates slap him on the back and needle him about his lack of previous relationships , then begin to introduce themselves to me ."
"i 'm quickly offered a beer and pulled into multiple conversations , but nate is there every few minutes with a hand on my back , making sure i 'm ok. as the night goes on , the porch fills up with more people , and , particularly , more women ."
"i 'm happily overwhelmed by all these new faces , but also glad to just lean on the railing for a minute to sip my beer ."
"`` brynn ? ''"
"i hear a woman 's voice call ."
"i turn to see cara walking up onto the porch ."
"`` hey ! ''"
"i say , and stand up to give her a hug ."
"`` how was your summer ? ''"
"`` um ... '' i murmur , unable to find the words to describe the last few months ."
"i look over her shoulder and watch a girl i do n't know place her hand on nate 's chest ."
"before i can even frown , though , he steps back and smiles politely , then makes his way over to me ."
"`` it was pretty crazy , '' is all i can come up with before nate 's arm snakes his way around my waist ."
"`` i just saw my mom yawning , so i think she 's about to go back to her hotel , '' he says ."
"`` oh , hey cara . ''"
"`` nate ... are you two ... ? ''"
"cara asks , her eyes darting back and forth between us ."
"`` we are , '' i confirm , as nate grins down at me ."
"it does feel good to say it out loud ."
"`` and you 've already met his parents ?"
"wow ! ''"
"`` yeah , we 've met , '' i reply a bit evasively , as nate bites his lip to keep from laughing ."
"i elbow him in the ribs ."
"`` we better go say goodbye to his mom . ''"
"sure enough , eileen is shouldering her purse and looking around as we walk over ."
"`` i hope i did n't take up too much of your time with nate tonight , '' i say as we walk up ."
"`` not at all ."
"i would n't be here at all if it were n't for you , '' she says , wrapping me up in a big hug ."
"`` will you join us for brunch tomorrow before i head back home ? ''"
"i glance at nate , who 's looking at me encouragingly ."
"`` i 'd love to . ''"
"`` great , i 'll see you tomorrow then ! ''"
"she says , giving nate a hug before walking down the steps ."
"`` is it weird that i want to be friends with your mom ? ''"
"i ask him as we watch her get into her car ."
"`` not weirder than sleeping with your stepbrother , '' he murmurs wickedly in my ear ."
"`` you think you 've had enough of this party ? ''"
"i shiver at the implication of his words ."
"`` i think so . ''"
"he nods over his shoulder toward the front door of the house and i follow him inside ."
"the living room has several people in it now , but he continues up the steps and to his bedroom down the hall ."
"`` there is n't going to be another girl under your covers , is there ? ''"
"i ask him teasingly as he opens the door ."
"he turns to me with a grin ."
"`` only you now , brynn . ''"
"he wraps his arms around my waist and pulls me across the threshold , shutting the door behind me and then pressing me up against it ."
"my body lights up with desire as his mouth covers mine and he pulls my arms over my head , keeping them pinned to the door with one hand over my wrists ."
"i feel his other hand pulling up the hem of my summer dress as his legs push between mine ."
"`` alright if this one 's a little quick ? ''"
"he asks , nibbling on my ear ."
"`` i just want to feel you , '' i breathe , arching my back and pressing my breasts onto his chest ."
"with a grunt , he pulls away , reaching into his pocket ."
"i pull my dress over my head as he yanks his zipper down and pushes his boxers and khakis to his knees , rolling the condom over his length ."
"i barely manage to get my panties to the floor when he steps back into me , grabbing my ass and hoisting me up ."
"i moan as i feel his tip press against my opening ."
"i must have tightened up a bit in the time we 've spent apart because there 's a shot of pain as he slides me down his shaft ."
"i wrap my arms around the back of his neck and lock my ankles just above his ass as he leans me back against the door ."
"`` oh fuck , '' he murmurs as he reaches his depth inside me ."
"he circles his hips , letting me feel him inside me at every angle before pulling back out again ."
"i marvel at his strength as he 's able to hold me in place and thrust in and out of me with almost no support from me ."
"the pain is gone by just his third thrust , and pleasure begins to course through my veins ."
"my toes curl and i run my hands through his hair , then lean forward and slide my tongue inside his mouth ."
"to my surprise , he steps away from the door , wrapping one arm around my back to keep me supported ."
"he sinks down onto the edge of his bed so that i 'm sitting on top of him ."
"i unlock my ankles and move my legs so that i 'm kneeling on the mattress ."
"i rise up onto my knees as he leans back on his hands , getting used to the feeling of riding him ."
"i reach my arms back , bringing my hands to the top of his thighs as i slide down him , feeling him stretching me open ."
"he 's hitting me in all the right places and i begin to move faster and faster ."
"i keep my eyes open , watching as his mouth drops open and his jaw clenches ."
"i love seeing that i 'm pushing him right to the edge even as an orgasm is quickly building inside of me ."
"his hips begin to pick up off the bed , slamming into me as i sink down ."
"the extra power is just what i need , and i feel myself explode on top of him just as he begins to cry out ."
"i keep rising up and down as i come , feeling how slick i am inside ."
"he pulls me tight against him , resting his head between my breasts , as we both take deep , gasping breaths ."
"but he 's not done yet ."
"i feel his hands creep up to my bra strap , unhooking it and sliding it down my arms ."
"even though i 'm exhausted , i lean back and lift up my arms so he can slide it all the way off ."
"he tosses it onto a nearby chair then sighs and runs his fingers down my neck , across my clavicle , then down my shoulders ."
"`` i missed you , '' he murmurs kissing me softly in the middle of my chest ."
"i bend my head down and kiss his hairline , then reach down and tug at his shirt ."
"he obediently lifts his arms up so i can slide it off ."
"`` mm , '' i mutter as i lean forward against him , relishing the skin-to-skin contact ."
"suddenly i feel him lift me up and turn me around , depositing me with my back on the bed ."
"he reaches down to hold the condom on as he pulls out of me , grabbing a tissue from his side table and finally kicking his pants and underwear all the way off ."
"he slides back next to me on the bed as i glance around his room ."
"it 's neat in here , as i 'd expect , except for floor-to-ceiling shelves next to his metal desk that are overflowing with textbooks ."
"`` had to have them put in , '' he says , seeing me looking at them ."
"`` but i 'll give you the tour later . ''"
"i feel his hand slide over my hips , pulling me toward him ."
"that hand slowly inches down as his tongue slides against mine , now working slowly , his urgency gone ."
"he groans as he feels the wetness between my legs and slides one finger inside me ."
"his thumb just grazes my clit and i gasp , pressing back against him ."
"`` do i still get to order you around in bed ? ''"
"`` yes , please , '' i whimper , closing my eyes as he begins to circle his thumb ."
"`` good , '' he murmurs , and his fingers pull away , but are immediately replaced by his mouth ."
"i moan as he takes a long lick of me , pulling my legs apart and repositioning his body between them ."
"he holds my knees out wide , opening me to him completely ."
"his tongue moves down to my opening , darting in and out of me-such a different sensation than his fingers or his cock ."
"as he moves up again to my clit , flicking his tongue mercilessly back and forth across it , i feel another orgasm begin to pool deep in my belly ."
"`` wait , wait , come here , '' i say , touching his hand on my knee ."
"`` i want to taste you , too . ''"
"he looks up at me with a grin , and sits up ."
"i press my legs together and he works his way up my body on his knees ."
"i pin my arms to my sides as he comes up and kneels on either side of my shoulders ."
"i pick up my head and he takes his hard cock in his hand , placing it between my lips ."
"i can taste the latex of the condom we just used , mixed with both of our own scents ."
"`` fuck , brynn , '' he growls as he slowly presses his hips forward until his cock hits the back of my throat ."
"he begins to move a little faster , but he 's careful not to overwhelm me , knowing that i 'm completely helpless under him ."
"i keep my eyes on his face as sweat begins to break out on his brow and his neck muscles tense ."
"with a groan , he pulls out of my mouth ."
"`` turn over , '' he orders me as he swings one leg over me so that i can follow his command ."
"i obey , feeling my breasts squish against the plain blue comforter ."
"i hear the rip of another condom and a moment later he lies down on top of me , sweeping my hair off the back of my neck as he does so ."
"i feel his breath on my ear as his cock pushes inside me ."
"i 'm so wet and he drives deep inside-maybe it 's the position , but i do n't know if i 've ever felt him so deep before ."
"he pulls out and moves back in slowly , eliciting a long cry from me ."
"i feel tears spring to my eyes at the intensity of the sensation ."
"`` squeeze your legs together , '' he whispers ."
"i inch them together , feeling my muscles clench even more tightly around his dick ."
"his legs are on either side of me now , and i can feel that he has more traction as he thrusts in harder now ."
"his tongue finds my ear and my body begins to shake as his tongue flicks inside me ."
"i hear myself begin to moan as though it 's coming from someone else , though i also feel completely at one with my body and his ."
"`` yes , yes , fuck , '' he grunts on top of me ."
"`` come with me , come with me ! ''"
"i have no choice but to obey again , unraveling beneath him as he releases himself inside me ."
"after a few final strokes , i feel him let go of his weight , relaxing on top of me ."
"his nose nuzzles into the side of my cheek , his lips just finding the edge of my mouth to give me a kiss ."
"`` you know what the best part is ? ''"
"he whispers ."
"`` mm ? ''"
"i murmur back , my tired brain unable to follow his train of thought ."
"`` you can stay the night . ''"
"epilogue `` man , i 'm glad this place has central air , '' i say , setting down the last of the boxes in our new apartment ."
"i 'm sweating even with it on , and use the bottom of my t-shirt to wipe my forehead ."
"`` yeah , i thought boston was supposed to be cooler than virginia , '' nate says , shaking his head with a smile as he hoists a box onto the counter as though it weighed nothing , though i know for a fact it has our heavy dishes in it ."
"we flew up here for a weekend last month to find an apartment , and were quite lucky that this charlestown two-bedroom was just our third stop ."
"the realtor described the neighborhood as `` up-and-coming , '' and nate loved the cozy feel and exposed brick ."
"neither of us start our jobs in town for another week , but i 'm glad we came early ."
"we have all the unpacking to do , we still need a lot of furniture ... `` are you going to get tired of me ? ''"
"nate asks , walking over and wrapping his arms around my waist ."
"`` living together , you mean ?"
"absolutely ."
"are you going to get sick of me ? ''"
"`` absolutely , '' he says , nodding seriously , then he grins ."
"`` i love you . ''"
"`` i love you , too , '' i reply as he leans in to kiss me ."
"once such a big deal for him to say , nate now tells me he loves me regularly ."
"i squirm happily as his tongue darts quickly against mine ."
"a year later , and his kisses still make me weak in the knees ."
"`` what 's that box ? ''"
"i ask as he releases me and i glance over his shoulder ."
"`` which ? ''"
"he asks , looking around ."
"`` there , '' i say , pointing to a medium-sized box sitting where we plan to put the couch , when we get one ."
"`` dunno , '' he says with a shrug ."
"`` clothes ? ''"
"`` mm , no , i do n't think so , '' i reply , walking over to it and picking it up ."
"`` it 's really light . ''"
"i shake it and can just hear the crinkling of paper ."
"`` that 's weird . ''"
"i set it back down on the floor and kneel next to it , scratching at the corner of the packing tape sealing it shut ."
"i finally get enough up to get my finger under it , and pull it across the boxes flaps ."
"nick comes to stand near me as i pull it open ."
"`` i really do n't remember packing this one , but maybe i 'm going crazy . ''"
"it has been an eventful week ."
"we graduated last weekend , and played host to both of our moms , and then just a few days later we were driving up to boston ."
"we both managed to secure jobs here , nate with a historical society , and me in the research side of a non-profit ."
"i pull the brown packing paper out of the box , piling it on the floor next to me ."
"`` oh dear , did i pack an empty box ? ''"
"i ask , just as my fingers close around a much smaller box at the bottom of the larger one ."
"`` what 's ... '' my eyes widen as i realize i 'm holding a jewelry box ."
"i glance up at nate , who 's grinning at me ."
"he kneels down onto the hardwood floor next to me ."
"`` oh my god , '' i murmur , as he takes the small box out of my hands ."
"of course we 've discussed marriage , but i did n't think he would propose so soon ."
"`` brynn , '' he whispers , `` i 've come alive since i met you ."
"my world before you came into it was cold and dark , and then you showed up and brought light into it ."
"every day , i find a new reason to fall more in love with you ."
"i know we 're still young , but i want so much to have the honor of calling you my wife ."
"will you marry me ? ''"
"he asks , opening the box ."
"i stare at the simple , beautiful diamond ring sitting in the middle of the red velvet box as my eyes fill with tears ."
"`` yes , yes , of course i 'll marry you , '' i gasp , wrapping my arms around his neck and covering him with kisses ."
"he laughs joyously and lifts me off the ground with his free arm ."
"`` here , try it on , '' he finally says ."
"`` i measured your ring finger while you were sleeping . ''"
"`` sneaky ! ''"
"i tease him as he slips the ring on my hand ."
"`` it 's a perfect fit , '' i say , holding it toward the nearest window so the light catches it ."
"`` should we call your mom ? ''"
"he asks , wrapping his arms back around my waist ."
"`` let 's wait until tomorrow ."
"for today , only you and i will know . ''"
"`` only you , '' he echoes , pressing his forehead against mine ."
"`` only you . ''"
"the end chapter one `` i thought you said this was going to be a small gathering , '' i shout , raising my voice above the blaring music ."
"i can feel the pounding bass line vibrating through my body as i hesitate at the edge of the gigantic house party ."
"`` did i say that ? ''"
"my best friend , riley , grins back ."
"`` i meant to say that this was going to be an 'epic rager unlike anything you 've ever seen ' . ''"
"i roll my eyes at her as we 're swallowed up by the teeming crowd of our classmates ."
"i should have known better than to think that riley would spend her saturday night anywhere but at a legendary party ."
"she and i have been best friends for all seventeen years we 've been on the planet ."
"but even so , our ideas of what makes a `` good time '' are starkly different ."
"if i had any sense at all , i would never have let her drag me to this party ."
"i 'd much rather be curled up at home with my sketch pad and a cup of tea ."
"but seeing that the damage is done , i suppose there 's nothing to do but try and have a good time ."
"`` here you go ladies , '' a burly junior boy says , sidling up to us with a red plastic cup in either hand ."
"`` first drink 's on me . ''"
"`` warm beer , now with extra roofies ? ''"
"riley says , cocking a perfect eyebrow at him ."
"`` we 're all set , champ , '' i tell the boy , producing a flask full of my dad 's very fine whiskey from my purse ."
"it 's not like he 's using it much , these days ."
"`` better luck next time . ''"
"`` what a couple of buzz kills , '' the kid grumbles , sulking away ."
"`` great party so far ri , '' i laugh sarcastically , unscrewing the top of the flask ."
"`` just remember , abby-in less than a year , we 'll never have to deal with high school boys again , '' she points out , accepting the flask as i pass it her way ."
"`` i ca n't wait , '' i say wistfully , `` i know you 're not supposed to wish away your youth or whatever , but the sooner high school can be over with , the better . ''"
"`` what ?"
"you 're not enjoying your glory days ? ''"
"riley asks with mock astonishment , gesturing toward our fellow partygoers ."
"i look around at the party unfolding all around us ."
"some rich kid 's parents are out of town , and the entire school has descended on their mcmansion to spend the night getting wasted , listening to someone 's crappy ipod playlist , and making questionable choices about who to sleep with ."
"i nearly step on two people going at it right in the foyer , writhing all over each other in a drunken tizzy ."
"with a wild yell , some kid tries to swing on the crystal chandelier , only to miss and fall flat on his face to onlookers ' uproarious laughter ."
"`` if these are our glory days , '' i say to riley , `` we 're in serious trouble . ''"
"`` come on , '' she laughs , slipping her fingers through mine , `` i 'm sure we can find a quieter corner somewhere ."
"there must be , like , a hundred rooms in this place . ''"
"i let riley tug me off through the party , ignoring the tipsy dudes who make lesbian jokes about us along the way ."
"as gorgeous as my best friend is , with her silky black curls , tanned skin , and amazing curves , i 've never been the least bit interested in `` experimenting '' with her ."
"we 've only ever loved each other as sisters ."
"but the fact that i 've never had a real boyfriend leads some people in my school to question whether i 'm into guys at all ."
"the short answer is , i 'm plenty into guys ."
"but finding one that 's worth the time of day at my connecticut high school has proven to be impossible ."
"well ... just about impossible , anyway ."
"the party is just a forest of legs and torsos from my vantage point ."
"at five foot three , i 'm what you might call `` vertically challenged '' ."
"being petite is great for hide-and-seek , but not so great for feeling like anything close to an adult ."
"or being treated like one ."
"but in a couple weeks ' time , the world will have no choice but to acknowledge my adulthood-at long last , i 'll finally be turning eighteen ."
"the only question that remains is how quickly i can get out of town and be on my own once i 'm officially a grown-up ."
"as riley and i climb the sweeping staircase and sidle into the master bedroom suite , we pass a passed out classmate who 's had his face graffitied with permanent marker penises ."
"yep ."
"adulthood ca n't come soon enough ."
"we poke our heads into the master bedroom , and i note with relief that it 's far quieter in this corner of the house ."
"maybe we can just hang out here and ride out this shit show in peace ."
"`` uh-oh , '' riley mutters , glancing down at me with a wicked glint in her eye ."
"`` look who 's here , abby . ''"
"i peer around my best friend , scanning the dozen or so people already hanging out in the master bedroom ."
"it only takes half a second for me to see who it is she 's talking about ."
"my solar plexus rocks on its axis as a very familiar set of blue eyes turns my way from across the room ."
"`` shit ! ''"
"i squeak , ducking back around riley 's taller form ."
"`` i did n't know he was going to be here ! ''"
"`` the entire school is here , abby , '' riley laughs , `` you could have guessed . ''"
"`` he 's supposed to be too cool for this sort of thing ."
"or whatever , '' i say , rolling my hazel eyes ."
"`` come on ."
"i do n't think he saw me ."
"let 's just go- '' `` hey , sis ! ''"
"a rough baritone calls from across the room ."
"`` what are you doing here ?"
"is n't it past your bedtime ? ''"
"i groan as a volley of chuckles goes up around the room , and turn to see emerson sawyer , my blue-eyed nightmare , striding toward me ."
"he 's easily six feet tall , with broad shoulders , a tapered torso , and effortlessly defined muscles ."
"his mop of shaggy , chestnut brown hair is artfully tousled , a stray lock swooping across his forehead ."
"he 's making jeans and a crimson tee shirt look as good as a three piece suit , and has a lit cigarette cradled in his full , firm lips ."
"naturally , my personal nightmare looks like an absolute dream come true ."
"`` do n't call me that in public ."
"or ever , '' i tell him , crossing my arms to hide the fact that my heart is slamming against my ribcage at his approach ."
"`` why not , sis ? ''"
"he grins rakishly , taking a long drag of his smoke ."
"`` because it 's creepy as hell , '' i reply , exasperated , tucking my long , ash blonde hair behind my ears ."
"`` and it 's not even true . ''"
"`` sure it is ."
"for all intents and purposes , '' he shrugs ."
"i 've known emerson sawyer for nearly four years , now ."
"or , rather , i 've known of him for four years ."
"our connecticut town has two elementary schools that feed into the same high school ."
"emerson and i attended separate grade schools , which were pretty starkly divided between the richer and poorer families in town , but ended up at the same high school together ."
"i noticed him the very first day of freshman year , when he mouthed off to our sex ed teacher for taking a hard line in favor of abstinence ( the most characteristically emerson thing ever ) ."
"he , on the other hand , had no idea i existed ."
"until this year , that is , when both of our lives-personal and social-got turned upside down ."
"`` what 's the matter ?"
"you ashamed to have a brother from the wrong side of the tracks ? ''"
"emerson presses , jostling me out of my thoughts ."
"`` do n't put that on me , '' i snap back , `` as if you can stand having a prissy rich girl for a would-be-sister . ''"
"`` you are kind of a bummer , '' he says flatly , `` but if it makes you feel any better , it 's your personality i hold against you , not your money . ''"
"i stare wordlessly at emerson , knocked into sullen silence once again by his masterful putdown ."
"by now , but emerson has figured out exactly how to get to me ."
"about two months ago , i got the shock of my life when my widower father , robert rowan , announced that , after four years of refusing to date , he had just met the new love of his life ."
"her name was deborah , he told me ."
"they 'd met at aa and `` really hit it off '' ."
"he talked about her incessantly , stayed out all night like he was a teenager again , and generally weirded the hell out of me ."
"after just two weeks , dad told me that he was in love , and wanted to introduce this deborah to me as soon as possible ."
"i begrudgingly agreed to be around for dinner the following night to meet his mystery woman ."
"we lost my mother sandy to a terrible car accident just before i started high school , so the idea of a new woman in my father 's life was a little hard to swallow ."
"still , i did my best to put on a happy face and be as supportive as possible ."
"i 've never been very good at saying `` no '' or standing up to my dad , so it 's not like i had much of a choice ."
"as our doorbell rang the next night , signaling deborah 's grand entrance into our family 's life , my dad asked me to answer the door ."
"it was n't until i was en route that he mentioned deborah 's son would also be joining us for dinner ."
"when i swung open the door to welcome our guest and her plus one , i 'm surprised that my jaw did n't crack from hitting the floor so hard ."
"there , standing on my doorstep , was emerson sawyer ."
"and i could tell from the blank , disinterested look in his eye that he had no idea who i was ."
"`` what 's this ? ''"
"emerson interrupts my thoughts , grinning as he snatches the metallic flask out of my back pocket ."
"a trail of sensation sears along the skin just above my belt as his fingers brush against my bare flesh ."
"goosebumps spring up where his fingertips glanced against my body ."
"it 's like my every cell is hard-wired to respond to him ."
"i need to give each and every one of those cells a stern talking-to ."
"emerson knocks back a slug of booze without checking to see what it is first , and lets out a raucous hoot as he tastes the strong whiskey ."
"`` you brought the good stuff ! ''"
"he crows , draping a muscled arm across my shoulder ."
"`` this must be from daddy 's stash , huh ? ''"
"`` give it back , sawyer , '' i demand , trying half-heartedly to push him away from me ."
"if i 'm being perfectly honest , the feel of his hard , solid body against mine is something i 'll never stop secretly jonesing for-but he can never know that ."
"`` come on , sis ."
"sharing is caring , '' he teases , holding the flask up in the air , just out of my reach ."
"mocking my height-or lack thereof-is one of his favorite hobbies ."
"i sigh , refusing to engage in his game ."
"sometimes , i miss the days where emerson did n't even know my name ."
"we do n't go to a gigantic school-there are about three hundred kids in our senior class ."
"so for the first three years of high school , i was able to harbor a huge , unrequited crush on emerson without ever actually having to speak to him ."
"emerson 's a lacrosse player , part of the `` in '' crowd ."
"because our school is so diverse , socio-economically speaking , popularity does n't depend on how much money your family has ."
"if it did , i might actually be known around school as something other than `` that short girl who 's always drawing . ''"
"but the gods of popularity did not decide to favor me , it would seem ."
"my very petite , nerdy , soft-spoken self is just about invisible in the halls of mccarren high school ."
"in fact , these days , the thing i 'm best known for there is being the daughter of the guy emerson 's `` hot mom '' is dating ."
"oh , goody ."
"`` just take the damn flask , '' i mutter , turning on my heel to go , `` i 'm out of here anyway ."
"enjoy yourself , sawyer . ''"
"but as i attempt to make my grand exit , emerson steps directly into my path , his staggeringly built body blocking my way ."
"i collide with his muscular form , my hands landing flush against his abdomen ."
"i have to swallow a moan as i feel his insanely cut six pack rippling beneath my fingers ."
"i step quickly away , catching riley 's amused gaze ."
"she knows all about my feelings for emerson , being my best friend and all ."
"hopefully , the other dozen people here in this room ca n't see right through me , too ."
"especially emerson himself ."
"`` do n't be such a downer , '' he laughs , handing me the flask and extinguishing his smoke in someone 's discarded red cup ."
"`` stay and have fun for once in your life . ''"
"`` i 'm not a downer ."
"you 're just a pain in the ass , '' i reply , snatching the flask out of his strong hands ."
"`` hey ."
"i had a very troubled childhood , '' he says over-dramatically , laying a hand over his heart and arranging his features into an anguished pout ."
"`` i ca n't help myself . ''"
"`` who am i , officer krupke ? ''"
"i ask , laughing despite myself ."
"`` give me a break . ''"
"it 's no wonder emerson is so popular , with his wicked sense of humor , his bad boy good looks , and his devil-may-care attitude ."
"he could have his pick of any girl in our school , of that much i am absolutely certain ."
"i 've been keeping careful tabs on his romantic life for years now , and he definitely does n't seem to be the `` relationship type '' ."
"he 's hanging out with a new girl every weekend , just about ."
"and it seems that this weekend is no exception ."
"`` hey emerson , '' a breathy voice says from over his shoulder ."
"two thin , manicured hands slide around his torso from behind , and a beautiful , green-eyed face peeks around his built form ."
"my heart clenches painfully as i recognize courtney haines , a gorgeous redheaded girl in our senior class ."
"she 's our resident thespian , the beautiful star of every single school play , talent show , and choir concert ."
"she 'll probably head to new york after graduation and become some broadway sensation ."
"but right now , she seems pretty happy in the role of girl who gets to make out with emerson sawyer tonight ."
"i have to admit , i would be too ."
"stop that , i chide myself , shaking off my discomfort ."
"you 're not allowed to like him like that anymore ."
"your parents are dating ."
"plus , he thinks of you as an annoying little gnat ... when he thinks of you at all ."
"get a grip , abby ."
"`` hey riley ."
"hey abby , '' courtney haines says , draping emerson 's arm over her shoulder ."
"`` glad you guys could make it to my little shindig ! ''"
"`` this is your house ? ''"
"i exclaim , looking around in wonder ."
"my dad 's place is pretty stately , but her home is truly a den of luxury ."
"it 's more of an estate than anything else ."
"our area of connecticut is chock full of gigantic homes , but her family 's puts them all to shame ."
"`` yep ."
"and would be my room , '' she smiles smugly , letting her hand travel down into emerson 's back pocket ."
"`` my parents were nice enough to give me the master suite and everything , their dear hearts . ''"
"`` how nice , '' riley says flatly , stepping up beside me ."
"riley 's family is distinctly working-class , and the trappings of wealth have never interested her much ."
"she 's never held my family 's financial situation against me , of course ."
"but that 's only because i 'm aware of the privilege that comes along with having a family that 's `` old money '' ."
"she has no patience for the rich kids in our school who seem oblivious to how good they have it ."
"and courtney is most certainly one of that number ."
"`` come on babe , '' the redheaded girl says to emerson , `` we 're just about to play a little game ."
"you girls should play too ! ''"
"`` what sort of game are we talking about ? ''"
"riley asks , stealing a nip of my booze ."
"`` darts ?"
"poker ? ''"
"`` seven minutes in heaven , '' courtney squeals , bouncing up and down excitedly on the balls of her feet ."
"`` are you serious ? ''"
"i blurt out ."
"`` sure , '' courtney replies , miffed by my less-than-enthusiastic response ."
"`` what 's the problem ?"
"we 're doing it ironically ."
"you 're some kind of hipster , are n't you ?"
"you should appreciate that . ''"
"`` i 'm not a hipster , '' i reply , `` i just like to read , occasionally . ''"
"emerson tries to cover up a hearty chuckle with a cough ."
"i glance over at him , amazed ."
"did i actually just make my detractor-in-residence laugh ?"
"`` whatever , '' courtney chirps , towing emerson back toward the group , `` join in or do n't . ''"
"`` let 's get out of here , '' i mutter to riley , as emerson strides away ."
"`` and miss your chance to wind up in the closet with your otl ? ''"
"she grins back ."
"`` my what ? ''"
"i ask blankly ."
"`` your one true love , obviously , '' she says , looping an arm around my waist and dragging me toward the group ."
"`` oh please , '' i whisper , `` it was just a crush !"
"and besides , it 's over now . ''"
"`` right , '' she says , rolling her eyes , `` because i did n't just see you fawn over his six pack for a long , steamy moment back there . ''"
"`` i did n't fawn over anything , '' i hiss , `` i just- '' `` ok ! ''"
"courtney chirps , rubbing her hands together and looking around at her assembled guests ."
"`` let 's do this ."
"everyone know the rules of seven minutes in heaven ? ''"
"her eyes land on me ."
"`` abby ? ''"
"`` ha ."
"ha . ''"
"i murmur , wanting very badly to melt into a puddle ."
"`` yes , i know the rules ."
"i was in eighth grade once , too . ''"
"the group chuckles , surprised by my swipe at the queen bee ."
"courtney is n't the kind of girl who gets talked back to very often ."
"which , in my opinion , is why she should be talked back to at every opportunity ."
"even emerson cocks his head at me in something that looks faintly like admiration ."
"or at least , something other than generally bored disdain , which is his default attitude toward me ."
"`` ok ."
"so who wants to pick our first two victims ? ''"
"courtney asks , her green eyes sparkling with mischief ."
"`` me !"
"dibs ! ''"
"riley says firmly , thrusting her hand into the air before anyone else has a chance to ."
"a cold stab of panic rips through me as my best friend smiles wickedly ."
"`` great , '' courtney chirps ."
"`` riley , you start ."
"who should we stick in the closet first ? ''"
"`` do n't you dare , '' i mutter under my breath , `` riley , i mean it- '' `` emerson and abby ! ''"
"riley crows triumphantly , shooting me a smile that clearly says , you know you want it ."
"you 'll thank me for this someday ."
"`` oh , '' courtney replies , the corners of her pretty mouth turning down ."
"`` i mean ."
"i guess that 's fine ."
"if you 're into incest or whatever . ''"
"our classmates laugh with delight as that taboo word drifts through the air like some smoke from one of emerson 's cigarettes ."
"a deep pang of shame twists my core ."
"i 've spent many a sleepless night berating myself for still being attracted to emerson ."
"i 've hurled the `` i word '' at myself a million times , hoping to break the spell he 's cast over me ."
"but no dice ."
"no matter how wrong the rest of the world might think it is , i 'm crazy for this gorgeous , cool , sneakily intelligent boy ."
"our parents little affair ca n't change that ."
"`` super twisted , riley , '' emerson laughs , crossing his thick arms ."
"`` i like it . ''"
"courtney 's eyes flash with jealousy as she swings her gaze my way ."
"`` fine , '' she snaps , clearly annoyed not to be heading into the closet with emerson herself ."
"`` but you two had better make good on it ."
"no twiddling your thumbs in there ."
"we 'll want some proof that you actually did something ."
"right everyone ? ''"
"a chorus of assenting murmurs sounds off around the circle ."
"i look around at my classmates , befuddled and humiliated ."
"`` what the hell kind of proof do you want ? ''"
"i ask , `` i 'm not the sex tape sorta gal . ''"
"`` figure it out yourself , '' courtney sniffs , shoving emerson toward me ."
"`` you can thank your bestie riley for her suggestion . ''"
"`` thanks bestie , '' emerson grins at riley , coming to a stop in front of me ."
"he makes a grand sweeping gesture , offering his arm as if we were going to a ball ."
"`` ma'am ? ''"
"he teases ."
"`` let 's just get this over with , '' i grumble , storming past him to the closet door ."
"the crowd makes kissy noises as i wrench open the door and march inside with emerson on my heels ."
"as i step into the space , i 'm taken aback ."
"i was expecting some kind of coat closet , with barely enough room to move around ."
"but of course , courtney 's closet is an enormous walk-in affair , with rows and rows of clothing , shoes , and accessories lining the huge space ."
"her closet is fancier , and perhaps even as big , as my bedroom at home ."
"there are golden-plated fixtures , a sparkly chandelier hanging overhead , and a decadent , velvet fainting sofa standing front-and-center ."
"emerson steps up beside me as both of our gazes fall on the couch ."
"we steal simultaneous glances at each other , then quickly look away ."
"my cheeks flame red as i try and dislodge the sexy image playing out in my mind 's eye : emerson laying me out across that sofa , ripping my clothes off , and having his way with me as the smooth velvet upholstery caresses my bare skin ."
"he , on the other hand , is probably preoccupied with counting down the minutes before this little joke is over ."
"`` see ?"
"this is why i never come to parties , '' i murmur , crossing my arms tightly across my chest ."
"`` really ?"
"i thought it was 'cause no one ever asked you to , '' he says wryly , taking a seat on the fainting sofa and stretching out his long , toned body ."
"tormenting me , is more like it ."
"`` i would have expected you to have better plans , at least , '' i reply ."
"`` we need to start coordinating with each other so this does n't happen . ''"
"`` what , this ? ''"
"he asks , gesturing around at the closet as our seven minutes unfold ."
"`` not this specifically , '' i say , rolling my eyes , `` i just mean we should avoid seeing each other any more than we absolutely have to ."
"especially now that you and your mother ... '' i trail off , shaking my head ."
"`` since we what ? ''"
"emerson snaps , suddenly on the defensive , `` invaded your precious ivory tower ? ''"
"i bite my lip , intimidated by his heated tone ."
"my dad and deborah have recently decided to move in together ."
"or rather , they 've decided that deborah and emerson are going to move in with us ."
"they 're going to rent out their apartment on the other side of town and shack up in our place for the time being ."
"one big , utterly strange , less-than-happy family ."
"as if crushing on emerson was n't weird enough for me , now the object of my unfortunate desire is going to be sleeping under the same roof , as well ."
"college really ca n't start soon enough for me ."
"`` you have to admit , it 's kind of strange , '' i murmur , averting my eyes ."
"`` dad and deborah 's whole thing , i mean ."
"they 've known each other for , what , two months ?"
"and they 're already moving in together ? ''"
"`` my mom 's a crazy , impulsive bitch , '' emerson shrugs , `` and your dad seems like someone who does whatever the fuck he wants without thinking about the consequences ."
"what about this is surprising to you ? ''"
"`` good point , '' i laugh hollowly , daring to sit on the very edge of the couch beside him ."
"the mere proximity of his body to mine has my stomach twisting in anxious knots ."
"has it been seven minutes yet or what ?"
"`` well , '' emerson sighs , swinging his legs around so that he 's sitting beside me ."
"`` are we gon na get it on now or what ? ''"
"`` ugh , '' i groan , giving him a shove , `` stop it , would you ?"
"why do you get so much pleasure out of making me miserable ? ''"
"`` i do n't , '' he replies , `` it 's just so goddamn easy that i ca n't help myself ."
"how the hell did you get to be such a little prude ? ''"
"`` who says i 'm a prude ? ''"
"i shoot back , `` you do n't know anything about my life . ''"
"`` i know that i 've never seen you even talk to a guy , '' emerson shoots back ."
"`` what 're you , keeping track of my lovers or something ? ''"
"i reply ."
"`` get a life , sawyer . ''"
"of course , i do n't mind at all that emerson 's taking notice of my love life , paltry though it may be ."
"as insane as it is , i ca n't help but hope that there 's some chance he could come to feel the same way about me as i do him ."
"call me a dreamer , i guess ."
"a dirty dreamer ."
"`` what are brothers for ? ''"
"emerson grins , slipping an arm around my waist ."
"my head sets to spinning as the nearness of him entrances me ."
"i look up at his gorgeous , sculpted face , mere inches away from my own ."
"i 've never been this close to him before ."
"i memorize the contours of his perfect features-his high cheekbones , his aquiline nose , the scruff along his razor sharp jaw , and of course those dark blue eyes ."
"from this close , i can see that there are specks of gold gleaming in his irises , and a dash of freckles across the bridge of his nose ."
"at last , my eyes land firmly on his full , firm lips , half curled into a devilish grin ."
"his arm is still circled around my tiny waist ."
"am i imagining things , or is his grip growing the slightest bit tighter ?"
"a silence blooms over us , heavy and thick ."
"my eyes flick back up to his ."
"a cast of seriousness has come over his gaze ."
"to my amazement , i watch as his face moves closer to mine , by barely a millimeter- `` five minutes ! ''"
"i hear courtney call from outside the door ."
"`` shit , '' i mutter , tearing my eyes away from his perfect face ."
"my whole body is on fire with scattered anticipation ."
"for a second there , i actually thought he was going to kiss me ."
"talk about wishful thinking ."
"`` so ."
"how are we going to please the horny masses ? ''"
"i ask , nodding toward the door ."
"`` i have an idea , '' emerson says , his grin returning at full force ."
"`` you 're going to give me your panties . ''"
"my jaw falls open as i whip around to face him ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"i splutter ."
"`` you heard me ."
"hand them over , '' emerson says , punching me lightly on the arm ."
"`` i can hold them up as proof that we did the deed , and everyone will know that you 're not a frigid , virginal weirdo . ''"
"`` that is so messed up , '' i say , jumping to my feet ."
"i 'm just going to leave the whole `` frigid virgin '' thing alone for now , i decide ."
"no use opening that can of worms ."
"`` let those assholes think what they want ."
"i 'll never have to see any of them again in a few months . ''"
"`` come on , sis ."
"do it for me , then , '' emerson says , standing to meet me ."
"he catches my arm , giving me a soft tug toward him ."
"`` do n't you want to help me protect my reputation ? ''"
"`` not really , '' i reply , as he closes the space between us ."
"i wonder if he can see my heart pounding through my black sweater , see my knees trembling beneath my tartan miniskirt ?"
"`` what if i ask you nicely ? ''"
"he returns , his voice softer , huskier than i 've ever heard it ."
"he runs his hands down my arms , not an inch of air between our bodies ."
"that seriousness has hardened his features once again ... or is he just fucking with me ?"
"`` are you really capable of that ?"
"asking nicely ? ''"
"i try to joke , but my own voice seems to have dropped a lusty octave ."
"my breath catches in my throat as his hands land firmly on my slender hips ."
"`` give me your panties , '' he growls , his fingers tightening ever-so-slightly , `` please . ''"
"i stare up at him in amazement ."
"he 's totally serious ."
"if i had any sense at all , i 'd step away , laugh off his request , and wait for the next five minutes to tick by ."
"but my sense has been fully eclipsed by my want to please him in any way that i can ."
"maybe he 's joking after all , but i 'm not going to let this moment slip away between my fingers ."
"i have to show emerson sawyer what i 'm made of ."
"it 's now or never ."
"`` you have to turn around , '' i whisper hoarsely ."
"his eyes spark with intrigued wonder ."
"slowly , silently , he pivots away from me ."
"keeping my eyes fixed firmly on his face to make sure he does n't peek , i reach up under my skirt and slip my thumbs under the elastic band of my panties ."
"thank god i thought to wear one of my sexiest pairs tonight ."
"i do n't usually go for fancy underthings , but this black lace g-string is an exception ."
"my breath comes hard and fast as i slowly lower my panties over my firm ass and thighs , balancing carefully as i ease them down ."
"i step out of them , wobbling just slightly , and shiver as i feel the cool air against my sex ."
"i can feel myself getting wet , standing so close to emerson , bare and ready ."
"god , i hope he wo n't be able to tell ."
"unless he intends to make good on it , that is ... `` here , '' i tell him , holding up the delicate lace g-string ."
"emerson turns back to face me , looking taken off guard for the first time since i 've known him ."
"`` damn , '' he murmurs , taking the panties carefully-almost reverently-from my hand ."
"`` there 's more to you than i thought , abby . ''"
"he called me abby , not `` sis '' , i think to myself , a grin spreading across my face ."
"maybe seven minutes in heaven is n't such a terrible game after all ... `` now , my question is , '' i begin , easing toward emerson once more , `` what do you intend to do with those ? ''"
"those soft , sculpted lips part , ever-so-slightly , as he draws in a deep breath ."
"`` well , '' he starts , letting his blue eyes travel down the length of my body ."
"`` i can tell you what i 'd like to- '' a shrill scream rings out from somewhere within the massive house , a wave of frantic noise building from below ."
"the din rises , tearing my and emerson 's attention away from each other ."
"the pounding music cuts off abruptly , and through the cacophony ringing out beneath our feet , a new set of voices can be heard loud and clear ."
"`` police !"
"everybody out ! ''"
"`` break it up , break it up ! ''"
"`` anyone still here in five minutes is under arrest ! ''"
"`` fuck me , '' i mutter angrily , shoving a hand through my blonde hair ."
"`` certainly no time for that now , '' emerson laughs roughly , playing off our intense moment ."
"or maybe i was just imagining that intensity ?"
"i 'll never know now ."
"i squint as bright light floods the closet once more ."
"someone 's ripped open the door , revealing the chaos unfolding in the master bedroom suite ."
"courtney is bawling frantically as everyone else makes a beeline for the exits ."
"emerson shoves my panties into his pocket just in time , before riley darts into the closet to fetch us ."
"`` we have to go ! ''"
"she says firmly ."
"`` how are we going to make it past the cops ? ''"
"i ask worriedly ."
"running from the police is n't exactly my strong suit ."
"luckily , emerson is a bit more experienced on this front than i ."
"`` come on , '' he commands , a daredevil smile spreading across his face as he takes my wrist in his hand ."
"riley gives me a big wink as emerson carts me away into the frenzy of escaping partygoers ."
"we dive into the fray , the voices of police officers and drunken high schoolers commingling in a deafening clash ."
"as we run along the second story landing , i watch as one incautious classmate takes a swing at a cop , then finds himself in handcuffs a moment later ."
"i stay as close to emerson as i can as he barrels through the crowd , protecting me from the surge of moving bodies ."
"we careen into an empty bedroom and slam the door behind us , our chests heaving with exertion ."
"`` where did riley go ? ''"
"i ask , panicked ."
"`` no time to look for her , '' emerson says gruffly , striding toward the bedroom window , `` if i get arrested again , my mom 's gon na ship me off to the army or something . ''"
"he wrenches open the window and kicks the screen clear out of the frame ."
"`` is that really necessary ? ''"
"i hiss , as he peers out into the night ."
"`` jackpot , '' he says , ignoring my question , `` we can climb right down this trellis ."
"and your dad 's place-sorry , our place-is close enough to make a run for it . ''"
"`` how am i supposed to keep up with you , mr ."
"varsity athlete ? ''"
"i demand , planting my hands on my hips ."
"`` run fast , '' he winks , swinging a leg over the window sill ."
"i let out a frightening yelp as he disappears out the window , and rush forward to make sure he has n't fallen ."
"i look on as emerson dismounts gracefully onto the lush green grass below , looking up at me expectantly ."
"`` i ca n't do that , '' i call down to him ."
"`` you have to , '' he insists , `` do n't be such a little chicken shit , sis . ''"
"`` no ."
"i mean , i ca n't ... '' i trail off , blushing wildly , `` you still have my ."
"you know . ''"
"a wild , raucous laugh rips out of emerson 's throat as he remembers that my panties are still in his pocket ."
"i 'm totally commando ."
"and wearing a skirt ."
"not exactly the best trellis-climbing attire ."
"`` i promise i wo n't peek , '' emerson says , getting a hold of himself ."
"`` just come on . ''"
"`` no fucking way ! ''"
"i reply , crossing my arms ."
"`` look ."
"it 's either scamper down here , bare-assed , or get arrested ."
"your call , '' emerson shoots back ."
"`` i 'm pretty sure your precious colleges wo n't be thrilled with your having a criminal record . ''"
"i bite my lip , glancing over my shoulder as the din of the raid reaches its peak ."
"he 's right ."
"i 'm all out of options ."
"`` you have to close your eyes , '' i tell him ."
"`` i mean it , sawyer . ''"
"`` yeah , yeah , '' he says , screwing his eyes shut ."
"`` get a move on , weirdo . ''"
"a cool breeze brushes against my most intimate flesh as i scoot onto the window sill ."
"as far as strange sensations go , this has to be up near the top ."
"checking once more to make sure emerson 's eyes are really closed , i grab onto the vine-covered trellis beside the window ."
"with a deep breath , i swing out into the open air ."
"i 've never been very good with heights , so this is not exactly my idea of a good time ."
"`` oh , for fuck 's sake , '' i groan , as the breeze lifts up my skirt ."
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"emerson asks , one eye almost cracking open ."
"`` no ! ''"
"i screech , my stomach dropping at the thought of him getting an eyeful of my cooch from down below ."
"in a desperate , unthinking moment , i try and smooth down my skirt , losing my grip on the flimsy trellis ."
"i feel my body pitching backward , plummeting through the air ."
"i brace myself for the impact , waiting to hear my bones crackling as i hit the ground ."
"but in the next moment , i feel two thick arms wrap firmly around my small body ."
"i blink up at emerson from where i lay cradled in his grasp ."
"he did n't even stagger when i fell into his embrace , he 's that much bigger than i am ."
"for a moment , it 's all we can do to stare at each other in wonder ."
"we 're closer than we 've ever been before ."
"so , so close ..."
"i glance down at my legs and see that one of emerson 's hands is gripping my bare ass , full on-the tips of his fingers dangerously close to my exposed sex ."
"`` oh , '' i say faintly ."
"`` oh ... '' he replies , realizing what it is that he 's got a handful of ."
"he lowers me unceremoniously to my feet , brushing himself off brusquely ."
"am i crazy , or is that a slight blush creeping into his cheeks ?"
"`` let 's get out of here , '' he says gruffly , shoving my panties back into my hands and taking off at a jog ."
"i stare at his retreating back for a long moment before coming to ."
"with trembling hands , i step back into my lacy underwear and set off in his wake ."
"no way is he going to wait around for me-i should know that much by now ."
"chapter two we spend the next hour darting through the thick , shadowy woods that blanket the town , slowly making our way home ."
"barely a word is spoken by either of us as we make our way along , pausing whenever we hear a siren in the distance ."
"by the time we stumble through the brush and land in our backyard , i 'm covered in scrapes and dirt ."
"emerson , for his part , seems to be mostly unscathed ."
"but of course he is ."
"the lights are all out as we tiptoe into my childhood home-a stately but relatively modest tudor house ."
"dad and deborah must be asleep by now ."
"it is , after all , past two in the morning ."
"hopefully dad wo n't ask too many questions about what i 'm doing home in the morning-i told him i 'd be sleeping over at riley 's ."
"but he 's not exactly the type to check up , and i doubt that deborah even goes through the motions of keeping tabs on emerson anymore ."
"with a little bit of luck , we 'll be in the clear ."
"emerson and i slip through the back doors and plod up the carpeted staircase , skipping the creaky stair , coming at last to the second story landing ."
"there are three bedrooms in my dad 's house : the master bedroom just off the landing , which he and deborah are sharing now , and two smaller rooms at either side of the hall ."
"my room is down to the right , emerson 's is to the left ."
"he does n't even bother saying goodnight before turning away and slipping into his room ."
"with a sigh , i trudge back to my own quarters at the opposite end of the hall ."
"closing the door gently behind me , i belly flop onto my bed , burying my face in the fluffy pillow and fighting the urge to scream ."
"i ca n't sort through everything that happened between emerson and i tonight ."
"between the tense moments during seven minutes of heaven to his accidental but steamy caress after i took a tumble off the trellis , i 'm totally at a loss ."
"tonight was the first time we 've seen each other outside of school and home since he and deborah moved in ."
"and it 's certainly the first time anything so ... charged has passed between us ."
"i flip over onto my back , staring up at the ceiling ."
"the glow-in-the-dark stars i put up as a kid still hang overhead , despite my near-adult status ."
"with a pang of heartache , i realize that emerson and i are bound to part ways once we turn eighteen and graduate high school ."
"i 'll never know what could have been between us , if our parents had n't ruined everything by getting together ."
"then again , he probably never would have even learned my name if not for them ."
"so i guess i should be somewhat grateful ."
"emphasis on somewhat ."
"knowing that i 'll never fall asleep with all this tension built up inside of me , i roll over and slide open the top drawer of my night table ."
"there , hidden among a jumble of makeup and jewelry , is a tiny device disguised to look like a tube of lipstick ."
"its actual purpose is a whole lot more in line with what i need right now ."
"i press a hidden button on the little bullet and smile as it whirs to life ."
"my reliable vibrator-the best battery-operated boyfriend around ."
"laying back , i bring the vibrator down between my legs , slipping it beneath the lace panties that emerson held in his hands not hours ago ."
"the mere thought of his broad , capable hands is enough to get me off almost at once ."
"swallowing a low moan , i come into that black lace g-string , with emerson 's face suspended in my mind 's eye all the while ."
"`` hopefully that wo n't make breakfast too awkward , '' i whisper to myself , savoring the relaxing wave that washes over me as i drift into a deep , satisfied sleep ."
"the silence that first fell between emerson and i after he saved me from breaking my neck persists for the better part of the next two weeks ."
"my handsome housemate may as well be a ghost , for all i see of him ."
"he leaves for school early in the morning , stays out late at night , and generally avoids me like the plague ."
"did i totally wig him out that night at the party ?"
"i could have sworn that he was sending me some flirtatious signals , but maybe i totally misread him ."
"maybe he just thinks i 'm an incest-loving freak show now ."
"i 've never been the best flirt , i guess ."
"riley almost dies when i give her all the juicy details a few days after the party ."
"turns out she let us get separated when the cops showed up , so that emerson and i could have an `` adventure '' all on our own ."
"`` so , he basically took off your panties and finger-banged you , '' she sums it up as we head off on a coffee run during our school lunch hour ."
"`` that is a very liberal translation , '' i say , blushing like crazy as i stare out the passenger side window ."
"`` he is so into you , '' riley grins ."
"`` i ca n't believe it , after all this time . ''"
"she catches my frown and backtracks ."
"`` i mean , i can totally believe why he 'd be into you , it 's just- '' `` i know that 's he a bit above my pay grade , ri , '' i tell her , leaning back against my seat ."
"`` i 'm not exactly up to par with the girls he usually hangs out with . ''"
"without preamble , riley swerves violently onto the shoulder of the main road , causing me to yelp in abject terror ."
"`` listen to me , '' she says firmly , taking my face in her hands ."
"`` you are every bit as sexy and bitchin ' as emerson sawyer ."
"he 'd be lucky to have you , abby . ''"
"`` you do n't have to do that , '' i insist ."
"`` he 's the badass , gorgeous lacrosse star , i 'm the weird , short , artsy girl ."
"if this were a teen movie , maybe we 'd stand a chance ."
"but i know my place on the food chain ."
"guys like emerson do n't go for girls like me . ''"
"`` oh please , '' riley moans , rolling her eyes , `` in a few months ' time , we 're all gon na be out in the real world ."
"you could take your high-waisted shorts and dark lipstick-wearing self to any major city and be an 'it girl ' in three second flat ."
"the rest of these assholes will have already peaked in high school , so count your blessings that you 're a weirdo now . ''"
"`` thanks ?"
"i think ? ''"
"i laugh , `` really , ri ."
"you always know how to cheer me up . ''"
"`` damn straight i do , '' she says , tossing her black curls over her shoulder ."
"`` that 's what best friends are for-assuring you that boning your maybe-someday-stepbrother is totally chill as long as your dad does n't put a ring on it first . ''"
"i shake my head as riley laughs , pulling back onto the road with the radio blasting ."
"i try my best to keep riley 's words of encouragement close to my heart as the silence between me and emerson continues on ."
"you 'd think we were locked in a nuclear arms race , for how cold things have become between us ."
"i catch glimpses of him at school , and have the unfortunate experience of watching courtney try to stick her tongue down his throat on more than one occasion ."
"but as the days until my eighteenth birthday tick away , the silent treatment goes on ."
"a few days before my grand entrance into adulthood , i arrive home from school irritated and disgruntled ."
"the stress of college applications and ap course work coupled with the ongoing radio silence between me and emerson has me way on edge ."
"so the very last thing i want to see when i walk in front door of my home is dad and deborah , making out like a couple of teenagers against the kitchen island ."
"`` jesus , '' i mutter , starting for my room , `` is everybody getting some action around here besides me ? ''"
"`` oh !"
"abby ! ''"
"deborah giggles from the kitchen , `` good ."
"you 're home . ''"
"`` hi dad ."
"hi deb , '' i mutter gloomily , standing at the foot of the stairs ."
"`` i 'm just gon na head up to my room and get some studying in- '' `` nooo , come on ."
"come chat with us first ! ''"
"deb insists , bustling out into the foyer to apprehend me ."
"though emerson and i are the same age , deborah is about ten years my dad 's junior ."
"truth be told , she looks even younger than her biological age ."
"her voluminous platinum blonde hair is always arranged in luscious curls , her makeup applied perfectly ."
"this stands to reason , given that she works as a freelance makeup artist , mostly doing weddings and the like ."
"she 's way taller than i am , especially given her penchant for wearing three-inch heels ."
"and , i have to admit , the lady 's got a killer rack ."
"between the tits and her habit of wearing loud neon colors , it 's no wonder that my dad took notice of her ."
"my question is , what does she see in him ?"
"i would n't say that my father is unattractive ."
"he 's just very ... unremarkable ."
"he was quite the looker as a younger man , but my mom sandy was the real beauty ."
"their wedding pictures look like something out of a movie ."
"i inherited my mom 's facial features , but missed out on her vibrant red hair and hourglass curves ."
"ca n't pick and choose what you inherit from your parents , i guess ."
"and you certainly do n't get to choose who your parents are in the first place ."
"`` it 's been ages since we 've had a good talk , '' deb gushes , plunking me down at the kitchen table ."
"`` tell me everything ."
"how 's school ?"
"any boyfriends ?"
"spill , girl ! ''"
"i glance over at my father , silently begging him not to make me engage in small talk with his girlfriend ."
"but he just grins at the two of us like we 're some big , happy family ."
"as grating as deb can be , i have n't seen my dad smile like this in years ."
"it 's the least i can do to muscle through some mindless chatter ."
"`` well , '' i begin , `` i dunno ... '' the sound of the front door opening is my saving grace ."
"i look over my shoulder and see emerson stride across the threshold , making a beeline for his room ."
"but deborah has other plans , and rushes out to greet him with a squeal ."
"`` not so fast ! ''"
"she cries , seizing her son by the arm ."
"`` it 's not every day that i can manage to snag you and abby for a chat ."
"come on !"
"we 're having family time ! ''"
"`` are you high or something ? ''"
"emerson grumbles ."
"i can tell by his inflection that it 's an honest question ."
"i wonder what it must have been like for him , growing up with a single mom who had substance abuse issues ."
"my dad 's drinking did n't get bad until mom passed away , and by then i was already fourteen ."
"but from what i understand , deb 's drinking has been going on for most of emerson 's life ."
"my heart twists painfully just thinking about what a rough go he must have had ."
"no wonder he 's got more defense strategies than the pentagon ."
"`` this is so wonderful , '' deb goes on , forcing emerson into a chair across the table from me ."
"we immediately avert our eyes , looking anywhere but at each other ."
"the uncomfortable silence between us is deafening in this enclosed space ."
"what i would n't give for a trap door or an ejection seat right now ."
"`` while we 've got you both here , '' my dad finally cuts in , wrapping an arm around deb 's waist ."
"`` we should talk about your birthdays this weekend . ''"
"`` birthdays ? ''"
"emerson asks , his brow furrowing ."
"`` as in plural ? ''"
"i add , looking up at my dad ."
"`` sure !"
"have n't you guys figured it out yet ? ''"
"dad laughs , `` your birthdays are only one day apart !"
"abby 's is may 4th , and emerson 's is may 3rd . ''"
"a satisfied grin spreads across emerson 's face as he leans back in his chair ."
"for the first time since that night at the party , he swings his gaze directly my way ."
"`` look at that , '' he says , keeping those blue eyes locked on mine ."
"`` i am your big brother after all . ''"
"`` oh , that 's so precious ! ''"
"deb swoons ."
"`` i 'm so glad you two are feeling more like family ."
"that makes me so , so happy ."
"what should we do to celebrate your eighteenth birthdays ?"
"bowling ?"
"the movies ? ''"
"`` i was gon na buy a shit load of porn , cigarettes , and scratch off lottery tickets and have myself a private party , '' emerson says bluntly ."
"`` you all are more than welcome to join in ."
"though things might get a little ... awkward . ''"
"i tear my eyes away from his at this last bit , feeling my cheeks burning hotly ."
"he 's baiting me ."
"i can tell ."
"`` honestly , emerson , '' deb says , her cheerful veneer cracking , `` do you have to shit all over every nice thing i try to do for you ? ''"
"`` do n't worry , deb ."
"he was just kidding , '' my dad coos , planting a kiss on his girlfriend 's forehead ."
"`` were n't you , emerson ? ''"
"`` whatever helps you sleep at night , sport , '' emerson replies shortly , slapping his palms against the table ."
"`` now , as fun as this has been , i 've got things to do . ''"
"he strolls out of the kitchen , pausing for half a second to snatch a bag of chips out of the cupboard ."
"deb is so pissed off at his behavior that she and my dad do n't even try to stop me as i hurry off after emerson ."
"`` hey , '' i call to him , taking the stairs two at a time to catch up ."
"`` emerson , wait . ''"
"`` what ."
"did i steal your afternoon snack ? ''"
"he grins over his shoulder , holding the chips up over my head ."
"his favorite game ."
"`` if you can grab 'em you can have 'em ! ''"
"`` yeah , no ."
"i 'm not interested in your chips , '' i say , standing before him on the landing ."
"`` i just wanted to know if we 're on speaking terms again now or what . ''"
"`` what do you mean , sis ? ''"
"he asks , ripping open the bag and popping a chip into his mouth ."
"this boy can even making chewing sexy ."
"goddamn him ."
"`` i mean ... are you done giving me the cold shoulder ? ''"
"i press him ."
"`` you 've been avoiding me since that party the other night ."
"when we- '' `` whoa , whoa , '' emerson chuckles ."
"`` you are way paranoid ."
"i have n't been avoiding you ."
"i just have n't noticed you ."
"there 's been other shit going on ."
"and you 're pretty easy to miss . ''"
"`` bullshit , '' i snap , taking a step toward him ."
"`` i know you 've been going out of your way not to see me ever since that stupid game in the closet ."
"something ... happened between us , and- '' `` i do n't know what you 're talking about , '' he says , the joking laughter fading from his voice ."
"`` but i do know that i do n't want to hear another word about it out of you ."
"ok ? ''"
"`` you ca n't just pretend that nothing happened ! ''"
"i cry out , exasperated ."
"`` keep your voice down , '' he growls , glancing down at the kitchen where our parents are still talking in hushed tones ."
"`` i wo n't ."
"not unless we can have a real conversation about this , '' i say at full volume , crossing my arms ."
"`` you owe me that , at least . ''"
"`` you are so fucking impossible , '' he says , shoving a hand through his chestnut hair ."
"`` ok. fine ."
"you wan na take a drive or something ?"
"will that shut you up ? ''"
"despite the context of his offer , my stomach still does a thrilled somersault at the idea of being alone with him ."
"`` sure , '' i say , `` let 's hit the road ."
"bro . ''"
"`` i hope you know i 'm just using you as an excuse to get out of this house again , '' he grumbles , dropping the chips onto the floor and storming off down the stairs ."
"i follow right behind him , wondering whether or not he 's fucking with me ."
"at this moment , it does n't much matter ."
"i 'm just happy that he 's speaking to me again at all ."
"you 're just pathetic , i berate myself silently ."
"berating myself is something i 'm pretty great at-i have a lot practice ."
"`` are you leaving again already ? ''"
"deb cries from the kitchen as we try to make our exit ."
"`` you just got home ! ''"
"`` yes mother , '' emerson sighs , in his most over-the-top cordial voice ."
"`` abigail and i are going to take a spin around town ."
"take in some fresh air ."
"cheerio ! ''"
"`` oh ."
"well ."
"good ."
"you guys are spending some time together , '' deb says uncertainly ."
"`` um ."
"be back ... sometime ? ''"
"`` will do ! ''"
"emerson says , tipping an imaginary hat to our parents ."
"i step out the door after him , shaking my head in amused befuddlement ."
"`` and i 'm the weirdo , right ? ''"
"i laugh ."
"`` have n't you figured it out yet , sis ? ''"
"he says , striding over to the beat up chevy parked in the driveway ."
"`` we 're both weirdoes , you and me ."
"get in the car . ''"
"i trundle into the front seat , trying not to gawk as i settle in ."
"i 've never been allowed in emerson 's car before ."
"true , he and his mother have only been living with us for a few weeks ."
"but still ."
"being admitted into this `` sacred vessel '' of his feels pretty significant ."
"it 's all i can do to keep myself from caressing the worn out leather seats , the dusty dashboard , as if this car were a shrine to the boy i 'm crazy for ."
"`` so ."
"what kind of shit do big brothers do with their little sisters ? ''"
"he asks , rolling down his window and lighting up a smoke ."
"`` want me to take you to the playground or something ? ''"
"`` no ."
"but you could bum me a cigarette , to begin with , '' i say lightly ."
"`` you do n't smoke , '' emerson scoffs , looking over at me sharply ."
"`` not anymore ."
"but i did , '' i inform him ."
"`` no fucking way , '' he says , narrowing his eyes ."
"`` yes fucking way , i assure you , '' i reply ."
"`` come on ."
"gim me one . ''"
"`` if you do n't mind my saying , '' he goes on , passing me his pack of camels and a lighter , `` smoking does n't really seem like your kind of thing . ''"
"`` there are lots of things you do n't know about me , emerson , '' i reply , plucking out a cigarette and lighting it up ."
"`` but if you 're real nice to me , i might just tell you a couple . ''"
"he stares at me for a long , silent moment ."
"the same look he trained on me the night of the party-in the closet when i handed him my panties , when he caught me in his arms after i fell-is there in his eyes again now ."
"i do my best to draw deep breaths , hoping he ca n't read my thoughts ."
"my desires ."
"but instead of giving me any sort of clue as to what he 's thinking , he just starts the car and drives off toward town ."
"we zoom along in silence , unsure of what to say ."
"or at least , i 'm unsure ."
"maybe he just does n't care to spare any words on me ."
"after a while , he flips on the car radio ."
"a song by the foo fighters comes on , and i sit up a little in my seat ."
"they 're one of my favorite bands-just heavy enough for my taste ."
"i start singing along , nodding my head with the beat ."
"emerson lets out a short , surprised laugh ."
"`` would have taken you for more of a taylor swift kind of girl , '' he says over the music ."
"`` but i 'm not supposed to make assumptions about you anymore , right ? ''"
"`` that 's right , '' i smile ."
"`` can i at least assume that you 'll want dinner at some point tonight ? ''"
"he asks ."
"i have to fight hard from letting a dopey , love-struck look escape across my features ."
"he just wants to grab food ."
"it 's not a date ."
"i just happen to be along for the ride ."
"but still ."
"`` yeah , i 'm starving , '' i tell him ."
"`` great ."
"me too ."
"let 's swing by the crystal dawn , '' he says , turning off onto a main road in town ."
"chapter three the crystal dawn is our local diner , frequented by just about everyone in our relatively small town ."
"high school kids , senior citizens , working class parents-no one can resist the crystal 's dawn 's greasy spoon appeal ."
"emerson rolls up to the silver diner and swings into a parking space , cutting off another car with a laugh ."
"`` do you just go out of your way to antagonize people ? ''"
"i ask , stepping onto the sidewalk ."
"`` i do n't mean to antagonize them ."
"most people just happen to be assholes ."
"i just treat them the way they deserve . ''"
"he shrugs , tossing his smoke into the gutter ."
"i follow suit , relishing my final drag ."
"it 's been over a year since i 've had a cigarette ."
"damn , do i miss them sometimes ."
"`` what a charming attitude , '' i say , rolling my eyes ."
"`` thanks sis , '' emerson winks , holding the door open for me like a real gentleman ."
"or so i think , until he lets it fall in my face at the last possible second ."
"yeah ."
"maybe all this lovey-dovey nonsense is just in my head after all ."
"we walk across the crowded dining car , over to a red vinyl booth in the back corner ."
"one of the regular waitresses , a woman in her forties with heavy blue eye shadow and a perm , plunks a couple of menus down onto the table ."
"we do n't even have to look at them , of course ."
"we 've both lived in this town long enough to know exactly what we want ."
"it 's said that you can tell a lot about a person by their usual crystal dawn order ."
"`` what 're you having ? ''"
"i ask emerson with a playfully grave tone ."
"he wiggles his eyebrows conspiratorially , perfectly aware of the weight of the question ."
"`` bacon burger ."
"medium rare ."
"chipotle mayo . ''"
"`` of course you 're a raging carnivore , '' i groan , shaking my head ."
"`` well , what are you getting ? ''"
"he shoots back ."
"`` broccoli and cheese soup in a bread bowl , '' i smile ."
"`` wait , '' he replies , laying his hands on the table ."
"`` you 're not ... a vegetarian , are you ? ''"
"`` i sure am , '' i reply with a chipper smile ."
"`` of fucking course , '' he grumbles , looking downright appalled ."
"`` you know factory farming is destroying our planet , right ? ''"
"i tease him , putting on my best goodie-two-shoes voice ."
"`` you know that tofu is a sin against humanity , right ? ''"
"he shoots back ."
"that one takes me by surprise , drawing a real laugh out of me for once ."
"`` to be perfectly honest , i did n't start being a vegetarian for the environment 's sake , '' i tell him ."
"`` i wish i was that noble ."
"but the real reason is way stupider . ''"
"`` well ."
"why did you start ? ''"
"he asks , halfway interested ."
"that 's still halfway more than usual , at least ."
"`` when i was eight , my dad let me watch jurassic park with him , '' i reply ."
"`` you know that scene where the goat gets eaten by the t-rex , and its leg flies up and sticks to the window ? ''"
"`` yeah , obviously , '' emerson replies ."
"`` shit was groady . ''"
"`` yep ."
"that 's what did it , '' i admit ."
"`` i have n't eaten meat since watching that movie ."
"my mom was so pissed at my dad for turning me off chicken nuggets , i do n't think she spoke to him for days ."
"they kept waiting for me to grow out of it , but i never did ."
"and so , here we are . ''"
"`` that 's hilarious , '' emerson says , smiling genuinely for perhaps the first time i 've known him ."
"it 's not like his usual , sarcastic grin ."
"it 's something warmer , more honest ."
"and it just about does me in ."
"luckily , the waitress comes back for our orders right at that moment , so i do n't end up throwing myself at him right then and there ."
"we lapse into silence again as we wait for our food to arrive ."
"he agreed to talk to me about what 's been going on between us , since the night of the party ."
"but now that the moment has arrived , i ca n't think of how to begin ."
"`` so ."
"are you and courtney a thing or what ? ''"
"i blurt out ."
"smooth , abby , i grumble internally ."
"`` courtney ?"
"nah , '' emerson shrugs , `` a little too high maintenance for me ."
"and crazy as shit , too ."
"plus she 's always got show tunes on ... who listens to show tunes for fun ? ''"
"`` i 'm sure she 's ... nice ."
"when you get to know her , '' i reply ."
"the last thing i want to do is go shitting on other girls just because they happen to have sucked face with emerson ."
"if i did that , just about every pretty girl in our school would be on my shit list ."
"girl on girl hate is something i try and avoid altogether , if i can help it ."
"`` i 'm not really that interested in 'nice ' , is the thing , '' emerson scoffs , picking at a bit of loose paint on the table ."
"`` what ... are you interested in ? ''"
"i ask , my voice going soft on me ."
"emerson lifts his eyes to mine , the gold specks reflecting in the dying spring light outside the diner window ."
"i swallow hard , waiting for him to go on ."
"`` i 'm interested in someone who can teach me things ."
"show me things , '' he says ."
"i 'm totally taken aback by his direct answer ."
"`` oh ? ''"
"i say meekly ."
"`` i could hang out with hot girls who do n't give a damn about me as a person , or look for someone who seems interested in something other than my fantastic body , '' he continues , `` i 'm gon na go with the latter . ''"
"of course , he ca n't let a serious phrase go by without turning into a joke ."
"is that a defense mechanism or what ?"
"`` have you ever met someone like that ? ''"
"i dare to ask him , `` someone you could be interested in for more than a weekend ? ''"
"he lets me writhe under his gaze , taking his sweet time to formulate an answer to my question ."
"i can feel my cheeks growing hotter by the second before he finally says one word : `` maybe . ''"
"the rest of the restaurant seems to fall away around us as emerson trains his eyes on me ."
"i have to choose my response very , very carefully here ."
"this one little moment could be a turning point ."
"a transformation ."
"with my heart in my throat , i let my hand rest on the table , only a couple of inches away from his ."
"those mere inches of space spark with electricity , searing my already frayed nerves ."
"i wish i could tell him that i want the same thing from a relationship-to be with someone who challenges me , like he does ."
"someone who 's not interested in being nice or normal , like he is ."
"someone who could show me a life i 'd never be able to dream up on my own ."
"like he very well could ."
"`` emerson , '' i say softly , letting my hand drift slowly toward his , `` i- '' the front door of the diner flies open , slamming against the wall with a loud clatter ."
"emerson turns to look over his shoulder at the sound , and just like that , the spell is broken ."
"shit ."
"i glance up , annoyed , to see who 's disrupted our near-perfect moment ."
"but when i recognize the group that 's just sauntered inside , i feel myself going numb ."
"`` goddamn it , '' i whisper , `` not now . ''"
"i quickly hiding my hands under the table , not wanting emerson to see how they 've begun to shake ."
"i pretend to be very interested in something out the window as i hear the boisterous voices of three guys from my school fill the enclosed space , one of whom i 'm very intimately , and very unfortunately , acquainted with ."
"to my horror , i watch from the corner of my eye as emerson waves at the trio ."
"of course ."
"they 're his lacrosse teammates ."
"he has no idea why flagging them down is the worst thing he could possibly do to me right now ."
"against my silent prayers to any god that 's listening , the three boys stroll over to our table ."
"emerson swings his body around to greet them ."
"`` hey guys , '' he says to his three teammates ."
"`` hey tank , '' says one of the guys , a blonde junior named steve , using emerson 's lacrosse nickname ."
"`` what 's up ? ''"
"`` nothing ."
"as usual , '' emerson laughs , `` what 's happening tonight ? ''"
"`` some people will be over at my place , '' says roger , a lanky senior ."
"`` got a couple of dime bags , if you want in . ''"
"`` you know i do , '' emerson replies ."
"`` we interrupting you ? ''"
"steve asks ."
"i feel their three sets of eyes fall on my face like laser beams ."
"shit ."
"i was hoping i 'd get out of this without having to say a word to them ."
"`` just grabbing some food , '' emerson says , `` right abby ? ''"
"with great reluctance , i raise my eyes to the four boys before me ."
"i try to keep my gaze trained on emerson , or even steve and roger , but my eyes ca n't help themselves ."
"they flick masochistically up to the third boy standing next to our table ."
"he 's as tall as emerson , with jet black hair slicked away from his hard jaw , his full lips ."
"his own dark eyes skirt away from mine the second we make eye contact ."
"he has n't looked at me in years ."
"i like to believe it 's because he ca n't bear to , that the guilt and shame are too much for him to deal with ."
"but in reality , it 's probably just cold indifference that repels his gaze from me ."
"his name is tucker jacoby ."
"he very nearly derailed my entire life , back when we were fifteen ."
"and it 's abundantly clear that emerson has no idea ."
"`` yeah ... '' i finally manage to say , my voice barely audible ."
"`` just getting some food . ''"
"`` you guys know abby , right ? ''"
"emerson says to the trio ."
"i can feel my skin starting to crawl with every passing moment they ... he lingers beside me ."
"`` sure ."
"yeah , '' steve nods , `` you do all those cartoons in the school newspaper , right ? ''"
"`` right , '' i say shortly , my hands shaking violently under the table ."
"`` that 's me . ''"
"`` i liked the one with the duck , '' roger puts in , `` did n't really get the joke , but- '' `` i 'm starving , '' tucker cuts in ."
"the sound of his voice is like an ice pick to my composure ."
"`` let 's get a table ."
"see you , tank . ''"
"he turns away without acknowledging me , just as he 's done for the past couple of years ."
"emerson raises an eyebrow at his retreating back before glancing over at me ."
"he freezes as he catches a glimpse of my upset expression , taken off guard by the extremity of my discomfort ."
"`` see ya , tank , '' roger says , turning toward the table that tucker 's claimed for them ."
"`` think you 'll swing by my place tonight ? ''"
"`` yeah ."
"i 'll get back to you on that , '' emerson says , his eyes still fixed on my troubled face ."
"the sudden concern clouding his handsome face is enough to make my own eyes prickle with hot tears ."
"roger and steve trundle away after tucker , leaving emerson and i alone again at last ."
"our food has yet to arrive , but i 've lost any trace of my appetite ."
"the air in the crystal dawn feels poisonous now ."
"contaminated ."
"i 'm finding it harder to breathe with every shallow gulp of air i can manage to force down ."
"`` abby , are you ok ? ''"
"emerson asks , reaching for me across the table ."
"`` i. i need ... '' i gasp , struggling to form the simplest words ."
"`` can we go ?"
"please ? ''"
"`` of course we can , '' emerson says , his voice soft but firm ."
"he rises to his feet and offers me a hand as i stand , shakily ."
"i feel the comforting weight of his arm as he drapes it over my shoulders , holding me snugly against his muscled side ."
"usually , i 'd be all butterflies and giddiness to be this close to him ."
"but in the midst of my anxiety attack , all i can feel is icy panic ."
"i ca n't help but glance over at tucker as emerson leads me out of the diner ."
"i should be used to the uncaring expression he saves just for me by now ."
"i should n't let the mere sight of him unravel me like this ."
"but i 'm just not strong enough to not give a shit ."
"i never have been ."
"after what feels like a decade , i settle into the passenger seat of emerson 's chevy ."
"as he rounds the car , sinks into the driver 's seat , and slams the door shut behind him , the bubble of my fear and apprehension bursts ."
"shame and relief crash simultaneously over me , rendering me speechless as emerson turns to take me in ."
"his look , infused with compassion , undoes me completely ."
"fat tears roll down my cheeks as i stare straight ahead , wishing that i could actually be as small as tucker makes me feel ."
"if i was , it would be easy enough to slip through the cracks and disappear forever ."
"`` abby , '' emerson says quietly , `` can you tell me what 's going on ? ''"
"i draw in a deep , ragged breath , trying to muster the strength for words ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' i finally manage to whisper ."
"`` i 'm so sorry . ''"
"`` you do n't need to apologize for anything , '' he says , his brow furrowing ."
"`` abby , is it ok if i hold your hand ? ''"
"his simple request acts as a life preserver , saving me from going under in this rush of emotion ."
"i look over at him and nod silently ."
"without pause , emerson reaches for the hand that is currently gripping my thigh , uncurls my fingers , and laces them with his own ."
"i cling onto him like a drowning woman , amazed that he took the time to ask me if i wanted to be touched ."
"i remember , through my thick fog of misery , that he must have plenty of practice being the comforter ."
"how many times has he sat with deb as she descended into a depressive stupor ?"
"`` thank you , '' i manage to tell him through my tears ."
"`` any time , '' he replies , giving my hand a squeeze ."
"`` are you with me now ? ''"
"`` i am ."
"i 'm here , '' i gasp ."
"his simple touch was enough to drag me through the thick of my panic ."
"i can feel the world coming back into focus around me ."
"`` if you want to talk about what just happened back there , '' emerson says , rubbing his thumb against my still-trembling hand , `` we can . ''"
"i look over at him , leaning toward me from the passenger seat ."
"i 've never seen him like this before ."
"he 's calm ."
"gentle ."
"caring ."
"and all for me ."
"i desperately want to explain myself , to tell him why i had to get out of that diner the second tucker walked in ."
"but letting him in on my shameful secret ... what if it wiped that compassionate look right off his face ?"
"what if he was never able to look at me the same way again ?"
"we 're so close to figuring out how to talk to each other , how to spend time together despite everything ."
"i do n't want to ruin that ."
"not for anything ."
"`` would you mind if we just ... went home ? ''"
"i ask , forcing my voice to remain steady ."
"`` sure , '' emerson says , `` yeah ."
"we can go home , abby . ''"
"he holds my gaze for a long moment before turning back to the wheel ."
"delicately , he extricates his fingers from mine to start the car ."
"but the second we 're in motion , i reach for it again ."
"his hand is my anchor in this moment ."
"i need it ."
"i need him ."
"we ride home in utter silence ."
"the radio stays off , the windows stay closed ."
"i gaze out the window at the darkening landscape , the familiar contours of the town i 've called home all my life ."
"the incident at the diner only makes me want to speed up the days until i finally get to leave this place behind , go somewhere where nobody knows me at all ."
"but how can i wish these days away knowing that my flight from here will mean being separated from emerson ?"
"anger floods in to replace my fear and shame ."
"tucker has already taken so much from me ."
"caused me so much pain ."
"now my long-awaited conversation with emerson about where we stand has been ruined , thanks to him ."
"if he proves to be the thing that keeps emerson and i from every truly getting a chance at being close , i 'll never forgive him ."
"then again , i never plan on forgiving him anyway ."
"there are some things that no amount of time or patience can mend ."
"i know that from experience ."
"chapter four despite emerson 's offer to listen if i want to talk about the `` diner incident '' , we do n't get into it upon arriving home ."
"dad and deborah have gone out for dinner , as they do most nights when emerson and i are n't around ."
"the house feels cavernous and cold tonight ."
"this place has n't felt like home since mom passed away , but after what just happened with tucker , the entire town feels uninhabitable to me ."
"i feel like i 'm fifteen years old again ."
"scared , confused , and so , so lonely ."
"only now , there 's actually someone here to help me through it ."
"`` we still need to rustle up some grub , '' emerson says , moving ahead of me into the kitchen ."
"he does n't seem to mind my radio silence about what just went down at the restaurant , but there 's definitely been a shift in his demeanor ."
"his usual grin has been replaced by a comforting smile , and his entire attitude toward me seems gentler ."
"nicer ."
"it is n't that he 's pitying me , thank god ."
"it 's almost as if he 's recognized something of himself in me ."
"go figure-i 'm sure he has more pain hidden inside of him than anyone should be made to live with ."
"`` well , i 'm a terrible cook , '' i tell him , leaning my elbows on the kitchen island ."
"`` could n't even boil water if i tried . ''"
"`` huh ."
"lucky for you , i happen to be an excellent chef , '' emerson says seriously , opening up the kitchen cupboard ."
"`` wait ."
"really ? ''"
"i ask , surprised ."
"`` really , '' he replies , `` i had to cook for mom most of the time growing up ."
"letting a wasted person near sharp knives and open flames is a terrible idea . ''"
"`` that follows , '' i reply ."
"`` so , what do you have in mind , master chef ? ''"
"`` well , '' he says , plucking a few items down off the cupboard shelf ."
"`` how do you feel about risotto ? ''"
"`` are you kidding ? ''"
"i blurt ."
"that 's one of my all-time favorite foods ."
"i used to ask my mom to make it every year for my birthday ."
"but there 's no way he could have known that ."
"`` i 'll take that as a 'fuck yeah ' , '' emerson smiles , plunking a container of arborio rice down onto the counter ."
"`` why do n't you find us a movie on demand to watch or something ?"
"i 'll get this thing whipped up in no time . ''"
"i follow his suggestion and head for the living room ."
"stealing a glance at emerson over my shoulder , i feel my heart warm up a few degrees ."
"his face is composed , free from the scowl that usually rests there ."
"with dad and deb out for the night , i can almost imagine that this is our place-mine and emerson 's alone ."
"we 've never once spent time like this together ."
"he hardly ever stays in for a night , and i 'm mostly preoccupied with extracurriculars and long study sessions at the library ."
"after our disastrous outing before , this evening is suddenly looking up ."
"maybe we 'll even get around to discussing this sudden shift in our relationship ."
"he 's cooking me dinner , after all ."
"clearly , miracles do happen ."
"i scroll through dozens upon dozens of movies as emerson cooks ."
"the savory fragrance of his recipe makes my stomach growl in eager anticipation ."
"`` jesus ."
"was that you ? ''"
"he calls from the kitchen ."
"`` not very ladylike , sis . ''"
"`` what do you want from me ? ''"
"i grin back ."
"`` your gourmet masterpiece is taking forever ."
"i 'm starving in here . ''"
"`` i could always just scrap it and make you some easy mac instead , '' he teases ."
"`` you 're not that inhumane , '' i shoot back ."
"`` that is true , '' he chuckles , filling two bowls with the steamy , decadent meal he 's prepared ."
"`` besides , this looks too good to waste . ''"
"emerson walks over to the deep sectional couch where i 've made myself a nest of pillows and blankets ."
"i let out a low moan as i smell the garlicky , mushroomy goodness of the food ."
"emerson hands me a heaping bowl topped with a mound of parmesan cheese and plops down onto the couch beside me , kicking his feet up onto the coffee table ."
"almost reverently , i scoop a bite of risotto onto my gigantic silver spoon and raise it to my mouth ."
"emerson watches expectantly out of the corner of his eye as i sample his cooking ."
"`` oh my god , '' i mumble around a mouthful of rice , `` i think i just came . ''"
"emerson lets out a bark of surprised laughter at my crass joke ."
"`` so you like it then ? ''"
"i nod eagerly , burrowing into the couch while i take bite after delicious bite of the food he 's prepared ."
"it occurs to me , as i nosh , that i have n't had an honest-to-god home cooked meal since my mom died ."
"that awareness only makes this gesture of emerson 's that much more meaningful to me ."
"`` so , what 're we watching ? ''"
"he asks , taking a bite of risotto for himself ."
"i grab the remote and click through to the film of my choice ."
"it 's an old favorite of mine ."
"`` ta-da ! ''"
"i say happily ."
"`` the fuck ? ''"
"emerson scoffs as he sees what movie i 've picked out for us tonight ."
"`` i thought you were gon na go for something with super heroes ."
"or vampires ."
"anything but this . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"i reply ."
"`` dr. zhivago is a classic ! ''"
"`` classically depressing , '' he says ."
"`` have you ever even seen it ? ''"
"i press ."
"`` well ."
"no , '' he admits , `` but look at all that snow and shit on the poster !"
"unless we 're talking about snow dogs , that 's never a sign of a cheerful movie . ''"
"`` cheerful is overrated , '' i tell him , `` and this movie is fantastic ."
"just give it a chance ."
"i promise , you 'll love it . ''"
"he raises an eyebrow at my fervid vow ."
"`` well ... '' i amend , `` i promise you wo n't absolutely despise it , anyway . ''"
"if it were any other day , i 'm sure emerson would never submit to watching an old , tragically romantic movie with me ."
"i can practically see him swallowing his pride like a big old bite of mushroom risotto as he says , `` fine ."
"put it on ."
"i 'll try not to fall asleep . ''"
"with a gleeful squeak , i queue up the film and settle back against the couch ."
"as the opening theme swells to fill our living room , emerson eases over on the couch so that our bodies are almost , almost touching ."
"his closeness , his kindness , and his understanding very nearly erase the upsetting events of this afternoon ."
"i let myself get swept up in the film , in his company , in the wonderful , unprecedented feeling of comfort that 's wrapped around me like so many blankets ."
"as we fill our bellies and turn our attention toward the movie , i 'm amazed at how normal this all feels ."
"spending time with emerson feels natural ."
"easy ."
"maybe there was a little silver lining to being so vulnerable in front of him earlier today , scary as it was ."
"of their own accord , our bodies drift closer together over the course of the long film ."
"the big meal has made me happy and sleepy , and i can feel my eyelids growing heavy ."
"emerson 's long , built body relaxes next to mine ."
"and as we both lose ourselves in epic story , he casually encircles me with a strong , muscular arm ."
"i 'm elated to be close to him , but more surprised at how effortlessly our bodies fit together ."
"i snuggle against his side , resting my head on his shoulder ."
"the warmth of his body is like a balm to my frayed nerves , and we stay cozied up for the duration of the film ."
"at long last , when the final credits roll , i 'm reluctant to reach for the remote , to let reality come sweeping into this perfect , suspended moment ."
"i think i can sense hesitation in him too , but that could just be a lot of wishful thinking ."
"at long last , the screen goes black ."
"the house is almost entirely dark without the blue glow of the tv ."
"but even so , neither of us makes the first move to disentangle our bodies ."
"if there was any question before , i know that this embrace is more than merely platonic ."
"emerson 's hand moves slowly along my side , sending sensation sparking along each nerve he brushes ."
"i turn my face gently toward his , peering up in the dim light ."
"his blue eyes gleam even in the darkness , and his caring expression gives me the courage to rest a hand on the firm panes of his chest ."
"i take a deep , steadying breath , willing myself to be strong ."
"steady ."
"`` thank you for this , '' i say , unsurprised to find that my voice has slipped low in my register with wanting him ."
"`` i know you were out to make me feel better after this afternoon , and ... well ."
"it worked ."
"this was exactly what i needed . ''"
"`` i 'm glad , '' he says , tugging me just a hair tighter against him ."
"`` i hated seeing you so upset back at the restaurant ."
"i figured dinner and a movie was the least i could do ."
"was that a panic attack , or- ? ''"
"`` anxiety attack , yeah , '' i reply , scooting up so that our faces are level ."
"`` i 've been having them for a few years now . ''"
"`` did they start when your mom passed away ? ''"
"he asks ."
"`` um ."
"no , '' i say , averting my eyes , `` not exactly . ''"
"`` you do n't have to tell me anything you do n't want to , '' emerson insists ."
"`` no ."
"i do want to ."
"i want you to know what today was about , i just ... '' i sigh , trying to find the right words ."
"`` hardly anyone knows ."
"and this whole us-getting-along thing is pretty new , you know ?"
"i just need to know ... that i can trust you . ''"
"i swallow a gasp as emerson lays a hand on my cheek , his eyes burning intently into mine ."
"`` you can trust me , '' he says , `` i promise you that much , abby ."
"how can i prove it to you ? ''"
"`` trade me a secret for a secret ? ''"
"i laugh , only half joking ."
"`` ok , '' he replies , his gaze unwavering , `` deal . ''"
"`` wait , seriously ? ''"
"i ask , sitting up a little straighter ."
"`` seriously , '' he says , letting his fingertips trail over my shoulder , down my arm ."
"`` i want you to know i 'm for real ."
"i 'll tell you a secret if you 'll let me in on one of yours . ''"
"i try my best to take deep breaths , suddenly afraid of knowing emerson 's secrets , being bound to share mine as well ."
"but i know i have to be bold , now ."
"i 've spent too much time living in shame and fear ."
"`` ok , '' i whisper , inching closer toward him , `` tell me a secret , emerson ."
"make it a good one , too . ''"
"`` all right , '' he says , his voice hoarse and low , `` i have n't stopped thinking about you for two weeks straight ."
"since the night of the party ."
"i got to see a side of you that night i 'd never seen before ."
"in the closet , during that stupid game ... you were so direct ."
"so ready ."
"and so fucking sexy ."
"if the cops had n't shown up , i do n't know what would have happened ."
"but i damn well know what i wanted to happen . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"i breathe , so close to him that i can feel his warm breath against my skin ."
"`` what did you want to happen ? ''"
"his eyes glint with something that looks like longing ."
"lust ."
"can this seriously be happening right now ?"
"is someone about to leap out from behind a houseplant and tell me i 've been punk 'd or what ?"
"`` it would probably be better for me to show you than tell you , '' he growls ."
"`` is that ok ? ''"
"unable to formulate a single word , i simply nod my assent ."
"with a fiery intensity i 've never seen in him before , emerson catches my face in his broad hands ."
"i can feel my heart barreling against my ribcage as he takes one long , steady look at me ."
"before i can take another breath , he 's brought his lips to mine in a searing , earnest kiss ."
"the entire world shrinks down to our two bodies as i feel myself subsumed by the sensation ."
"his lips are unbelievably soft , his mouth so strong as it works against mine ."
"i open myself to him , closing my eyes in rapturous bliss as his tongue glances against my own ."
"the taste of him electrifies my senses ."
"in this moment , there is nothing but him ."
"i gasp softly as emerson pulls me onto his lap ."
"i straddle him , wrapping my arms around his shoulders as his tongue probes deeper and deeper ."
"pressing myself flush against him , i let a low groan escape from between my lips ."
"i can feel through his signature blue jeans that he 's hard for me ."
"the full , stiffening length of him presses against my sex , exactly where i 've been dreaming of feeling him for the better part of four years ."
"my body has never been this alive with want ."
"not with anybody ."
"moving with him feels intuitive in a way it never has with any other guy ."
"i grind my hips slowly , feeling him grow even harder beneath me ."
"his hands slide down over my ass , running along the firm rise in my jeans ."
"he pulls me tighter , letting me feel just how much he wants me ."
"in a moment of daring , i close my teeth around his bottom lip , tugging gently ."
"he looks up at me in wonder ."
"`` where the hell did you come from , abby ? ''"
"he breathes ."
"`` i 've been here all along , '' i smile , running my hands through his chestnut hair ."
"`` you just have n't noticed until now . ''"
"`` please , '' he chuckles , wrapping his arms around the small of my back , `` you honestly think i never noticed you before ? ''"
"`` well ... you never said a word to me before our parents met , '' i point out , bringing my lips to his scruffy throat and kissing deeply ."
"`` why would i ?"
"you were way out of my league , '' he replies , running his down my sides ."
"`` i did n't want to risk making an ass of myself . ''"
"i start laughing so hard that i nearly topple off of him ."
"`` now that is hilarious , '' i crow , steadying myself ."
"`` me ?"
"out of your league ? ''"
"`` of course , '' he says , `` can you seriously not see that ? ''"
"`` all i can see right now is you , mr. drop dead gorgeous lacrosse star , '' i smile , feeling emboldened by his words ."
"`` and since we 're being honest , here ... i 've been carrying quite the torch for you these past four years ."
"i 've sort of been crushing on you from afar since ... oh ... the minute i saw you in school for the first time . ''"
"`` no shit ? ''"
"he grins ."
"`` no shit , '' i assure him ."
"`` how messed up is it that we only figured this out because our parents started boning ? ''"
"he laughs ."
"`` ughh , '' i groan , rolling off of him onto the couch , `` please do n't talk about our parents having sex right now ."
"or ever , for that matter . ''"
"`` fine by me , '' he says , shifting his body my way ."
"without another word , he lays me out on the sofa , lowering his muscled body onto mine ."
"he runs his index finger along my jaw , tipping my chin up toward his face ."
"`` i do n't want to talk right now anyway . ''"
"he kisses me again , his hands roving all over my body ."
"my back arches as he cups my breasts through my thin cotton tee shirt , letting his thumbs brush over my hard nipples ."
"as he kneads and caresses me , a low , pulsing pressure starts to build in my core ."
"i ca n't remember the last time i got off without my handy dandy vibrator ."
"it 's been ages since i 've hooked up with anyone , and the intensity of the pleasure emerson is bestowing on me is almost too much to bear ."
"almost ."
"`` i 've been dreaming of this for so long , '' i sigh , letting my head fall back against the couch cushions ."
"`` you have no idea , emerson ... '' `` oh , i think i do , '' he chuckles , pressing his hips against me , letting me feel that staggering length ."
"`` is that the secret you were going to trade me for ? ''"
"`` w-what ? ''"
"i stammer , my eyes springing open ."
"`` you know ."
"a secret for a secret ."
"like we said , '' emerson clarifies , propping himself up on his forearms ."
"`` oh , '' i say softly , feeling the wonderful peace this evening has brought slipping away as the moment of my big reveal approaches ."
"`` um ."
"no , i- '' `` shit , '' he mutters , brushing a lock of hair away from my face , `` i 'm sorry ."
"i 'm totally killing the mood , here ."
"i ca n't be trusted not to fuck up something as awesome as this . ''"
"`` you have n't fucked anything up , '' i insist , but it 's too late ."
"i can already see his expression darkening ."
"i need to backpedal , right things before it 's too late ."
"deep dark secrets can wait for a spell ."
"i need to show him that we 're on the same page ."
"and like emerson says , better to show than tell ."
"without a word , i reach for his belt buckle , whipping it open with a metallic clank ."
"emerson 's eyes go wide as i slowly ease down the zipper of his jeans ."
"i guide him onto his back , climbing on top of him as i work to release his member from his jeans ."
"his hardness strains against the thick denim , ready to burst through- we both sit bolt upright as the sound of keys in the front door lock ring through the empty house ."
"giddy giggles sound from beyond the door as emerson and i look at each other in abject horror ."
"no more playing house for us ."
"deb and dad are home ."
"`` shit , '' emerson fumes , buckling in his staggering erection and covering his lap with a throw pillow ."
"`` fucking shit . ''"
"`` it 's ok ."
"they 'll never know , '' i assure him , smoothing down my hair ."
"`` how would they ever even guess , right ?"
"i 'll still be right down the hall , you know ."
"this is n't over . ''"
"we trade wary smiles as the front door bursts open ."
"if i did n't know any better , i 'd say that our parents are absolutely trashed ."
"my dad all but carries deb over the threshold , humming some sort of ridiculous-vaguely familiar-marching tune ."
"but taking a closer look , it 's plain to see that they 're just excited , not drunk at all ."
"thank god for that ."
"a two-for-one relapse is not what we need right now ."
"`` abby !"
"emerson ! ''"
"deb squeals , kicking her high-heeled feet in the air as dad spins her around the foyer ."
"`` i 'm so glad you 're both here ! ''"
"`` you seem ... glad , '' emerson says , his brow furrowed as he takes in the sight of our giggling parents ."
"`` what 's , uh ... what 's going on with you two ? ''"
"`` did you win the lottery or something ? ''"
"i wager a guess , trying not to think of what would have happened had they come home just a few seconds earlier ."
"`` we did win the lottery , in a way , '' my dad beams , setting deb down at last ."
"emerson and i trade baffled looks , overwhelmed by our parents ' behavior , and the bizarre turn this evening has taken ."
"between our mutual confessions and whatever 's going on with dad and deb , i , for one , ca n't seem to get my bearings ."
"`` you tell them the good news , baby , '' my dad urges deb , wrapping an arm around her slender waist ."
"`` ok honey bear , '' she squeals , bouncing on the balls of her feet ."
"`` abby , emerson ."
"bob and i ... well ."
"let 's just say we finally figured out what to get you guys for your birthdays . ''"
"`` and what 's ... that ? ''"
"emerson asks cautiously ."
"in answer , deb simply holds her left hand up for us to take a gander at ."
"for a split second , i 'm totally at a loss ."
"that is , before i catch the sparkly glimmer shining off her ring finger ."
"there on her hand is a rock the size of rhode island ."
"an engagement ring , by the looks of it ."
"the implications of her new accessory wallop me as i sit beside emerson , staring in horrified silence ."
"deb 's wearing an engagement ring ."
"`` we 're going to get you each a brand new sibling !"
"we 'll be one big , happy family at last ! ''"
"she cries ecstatically ."
"`` what the fuck are you talking about ? ''"
"emerson says , springing to his feet ."
"safe to say any lingering evidence of our blissful excitement is long gone ."
"`` bob and i are going to get married , sweetie ! ''"
"deb goes on , her smile wavering ."
"`` we did n't want to upstage your eighteenth birthdays , though , so we 're going to wait until the weekend after . ''"
"`` how thoughtful of you , '' emerson snarls , his face turning bright red ."
"`` remind me to make sure and nominate you for mother of the year . ''"
"`` stop it , '' deb says , her eyes filling with angry tears ."
"`` you do n't get to ruin this moment for me ."
"you 're going to be happy for me , emerson ."
"for once in your goddamn life . ''"
"`` yeah ."
"i do n't really see that happening , '' emerson scoffs , his walls and defenses springing back into place ."
"`` at least tell your mother that you 're happy for her , emerson , '' my dad says harshly ."
"my eyes go wide at his tone ."
"he never reprimands emerson for anything ."
"`` already playing at being my old man , bob ? ''"
"emerson says , with a cold smile that does n't reach his eyes ."
"`` hate to break it to you , but that ship sailed a long time ago ."
"thanks for at least waiting until i 'm a legal adult to pull this crap ."
"that way i can bail on this shit show with no strings attached . ''"
"`` emerson , please , '' deb says plaintively , but it 's no use ."
"he 's already turned his back and marched out the door once again ."
"we hear his chevy start up and peel out of driveway ."
"i blink back devastated tears , looking longingly after him ."
"he could have at least taken me with him ."
"after everything we shared this evening , everything we did ... he said i could trust him ."
"was that just another lie to get in my pants ?"
"no ."
"of course not ."
"he 's just hurt by our parents ' carelessness ."
"hurt by what it means for us ."
"`` are you going to say congratulations at least ? ''"
"my dad asks me flatly , placing a comforting hand on deb 's back ."
"`` i ... i do n't ... '' i stammer , looking back and forth between them ."
"`` i do n't know what you want from me , dad . ''"
"`` that ... is very disappointing , '' he replies , looking as hurt as i 've ever seen him ."
"but how the hell am i supposed to congratulate them on what is clearly nothing more than an impulsive , terrible decision ?"
"they barely even know each other ."
"they 're still in the early stages of recovery ."
"what the hell are they thinking ?"
"`` so ungrateful , both of them , '' deb mutters , marching up the stairs ."
"dad heaves a sigh as she slams their bedroom door ."
"an eerie silence falls over the house , punctuated only by deb 's muffled sobs from upstairs ."
"my dad and i look at each other across the wide open space ."
"this is as alone as we 've been in months , ever since deb showed up on the scene ."
"i wish i could be honest with him right now , tell him how reckless he 's being , tell him how much it hurts me to see him pick up with the first woman he meets without actually giving a shit about her ."
"but i 've never been able to call my dad out on his bad behavior ."
"`` this is not how i saw tonight ending , '' he mutters , shaking his head ."
"`` i just wish you would have asked us if we were ok with this , '' i say , frustrated tears stinging my eyes ."
"`` excuse me , '' my dad replies , `` since when do parents ask their children for permission ? ''"
"`` i just ... you hardly know her !"
"she hardly knows you ! ''"
"i exclaim ."
"`` what is it you even love about her , dad ?"
"i mean , you do love her- ? ''"
"`` of course i do , '' he says gruffly ."
"`` i love how she looks ."
"how she carries herself ."
"her eyes ."
"her hair . ''"
"`` seriously ? ''"
"i ask , scoffing , `` you like the way she looks ?"
"that 's it ? ''"
"`` you and emerson will be adults soon , '' my dad says firmly ."
"`` before long , you 'll know what it feels like to want something-someone-so badly that you 're willing to do just about anything to be together ."
"i hope you 'll have the courage to make that leap when the time comes . ''"
"i almost laugh as he spews theses words of wisdom ."
"he practically just told me to go ahead and jump my soon-to-be-stepbrother 's bones ."
"but as absurd as this all is , i ca n't laugh at about it just yet ."
"the pain is far too raw ."
"there 's a good chance it always will be ."
"chapter five it 's three in the morning before i hear emerson 's car swing back into the driveway beneath my window ."
"in the four hours or so he 's been on the road blowing off steam , i have n't slept a wink ."
"have n't even come close ."
"my nerves have been on a hair-trigger , ready to snap clean in two , as i wait for him to return ."
"the second i hear his car door slam , i throw off my covers and roll out of bed ."
"crossing my arms over my chest and throwing my blonde hair into a messy ponytail , i pad over to my bedroom window and ease it open ."
"leaning out into the warm spring air , i see emerson leaning heavily against the hood of his car , looking up at our house with despair ."
"`` hey , emerson , '' i whisper , waving to get his attention ."
"`` what are you doing up ? ''"
"he murmurs back ."
"`` what do you think ? ''"
"i say , `` i was waiting for you ."
"stay there-i 'm coming down . ''"
"`` you do n't have to , '' he starts to say , but i 've already turned away from the window ."
"i take the stairs two at a time , not pausing long enough to be self-conscious about my tiny cotton shorts and camisole ."
"i gently push open the front door and step out into the darkness of the very early morning ."
"emerson watches as i cross the driveway toward him ."
"he smiles wryly at my approach ."
"`` are you trying to kill me with those shorts or what ? ''"
"he says ."
"though i know he 's teasing , there 's a frustrated , regretful hunger beneath his words that breaks my heart ."
"`` some of us have been in bed for hours now , '' i remind him , leaning against the car by his side , `` instead of rending our shirts and bellowing into the wind ."
"or whatever it was you were doing out there . ''"
"`` that about sums it up , '' he replies ."
"`` what , are you pissed at me ? ''"
"`` it would have been nice to not be stuck alone with our parents after all that , '' i point out , `` your mom cried for hours . ''"
"`` it 's one of her favorite hobbies , '' emerson shrugs ."
"`` you could have at least taken me with you , '' i shoot back ."
"`` after everything ... '' `` i know , '' he says , a small sigh escaping his lips ."
"`` i 'm not used to looking out for anyone besides myself , abby ."
"i gave up on my mom years ago , and i guess when shit gets real i just look out for me ."
"i 'm sorry . ''"
"`` it 's ok , '' i whisper , reaching for his hand ."
"to my relief , he lets me take it ."
"`` you 're back now ."
"that 's what matters . ''"
"he looks my way , his blue eyes gleaming even in the darkness ."
"i can see a million thoughts swirling behind those eyes , afloat in a churning sea of turmoil and rage ."
"i wish there was anything i could do to ease that pain ."
"and maybe , just maybe , there is ."
"`` come on , '' i say , tugging his hand , `` let 's go . ''"
"`` go where ? ''"
"he asks , standing stock still ."
"`` i 'm exhausted , abby . ''"
"`` just follow me , sawyer , '' i reply , pretending impatience ."
"`` unless you 're too chicken shit , that is . ''"
"he rolls his eyes with just enough playfulness to give me hope ."
"without another word , i tow him away from the car ."
"silently , we make our way around the perimeter of the house , the expansive back yard , the black water of the in-ground pool ."
"i lead emerson along the edge of the woods that surround our property , peeling off down a well-worn dirt path ."
"i expect his body to tense up as i drag him into the foliage , but he follows gamely ."
"i suppose he does n't scare so easy , emerson sawyer ."
"`` here it is , '' i say , after a few minutes of trudging along through the underbrush ."
"we 've come to a stop before a thick , sturdy trunk , inlaid with wooden planks that serve as footholds ."
"it 's a place i 've come to love and depend on as a safe haven ."
"during the worst of mom and dad 's fights , and later the worst of his drunken rages , this is where i 'd come ."
"`` what is 'it ' ? ''"
"emerson asks , raising an eyebrow at the makeshift ladder ."
"`` i 'll show you , '' i tell him , grasping a plank and pulling myself up a foot ."
"`` just do n't check out my ass the whole time i 'm climbing , now . ''"
"`` that ... is not a fair request , '' he smiles , as i scurry up the trunk before him ."
"i can feel his eyes raking along my body the whole while ."
"and despite my instructions , i ca n't pretend that i mind too much ."
"as we hit the point where the tree 's branches begin to fan out , i pull myself onto a wide wooden platform , scooting over to make room for emerson beside me ."
"this weathered deck was built to last , but it helps that i 've maintained it over the years ."
"it 's not quite a treehouse , but it does the trick as far as secret hideaways go ."
"`` well , this is rustic , '' emerson laughs , swinging himself up onto the platform to join me ."
"`` did your dad make this ? ''"
"`` my grandpa did , actually , '' i tell him , `` back when my dad was still a kid ."
"this was his and my grandma 's house , before they passed it along to my mom and dad . ''"
"`` did they ... pass away ?"
"your grandparents ? ''"
"emerson asks gently ."
"`` nah , '' i chuckle , `` they just decided that florida was more their scene is all ."
"did n't want to go through the hassle of selling this place ."
"they 're , uh , pretty well off , my grandparents ."
"good people , but loaded as hell . ''"
"`` not a very typical combination , is it ? ''"
"emerson replies gruffly ."
"he looks over as me as i avert my eyes , embarrassed ."
"`` sorry ."
"i did n't mean you ."
"i just- '' `` did n't you ? ''"
"i ask softly ."
"`` of course not , '' emerson says , reaching for my hand ."
"`` i told you not four hours ago how i feel about you , abby ."
"you 're not just some rich girl to me ."
"christ , i would never hold you accountable for your family ."
"that would mean you could hold me accountable for mine . ''"
"`` good point ."
"and i would n't dream of it , for the record , '' i laugh shortly ."
"`` though apparently , we 're about to have our shitty families joined in holy matrimony ."
"so ... congratulations to us ? ''"
"`` or something , '' emerson grumbles , shaking his head ."
"`` it 's a terrible fucking idea ."
"they do n't even know each other ."
"they 're going to make each other miserable . ''"
"`` i know , '' i reply , heaving a sigh , `` this is why marriage gets such a bad rap ."
"because assholes like our parents fuck it up for everyone . ''"
"`` seriously , '' emerson says , pulling out a cigarette ."
"i do n't even have to ask for one this time , he just passes it my way ."
"he holds the lighter for me as i run the tip of my cigarette through the flame ."
"we inhale deeply in unison , peering up at the stars through the canopy of leaves above ."
"our fingers are still entwined , natural as can be ."
"that might be what hurts the most-the potential of a relationship that feels as easy as breathing , scattered by our parents ' carelessness ."
"`` it 's not fair , '' i whisper , my eyes prickling with tears ."
"`` no ."
"it 's not , '' emerson replies , pulling me tightly against his side ."
"`` i mean jesus christ , their timing , '' i laugh , though nothing about this is funny ."
"`` no kidding , '' he replies , `` if they had n't shown up when they did ... abby , i do n't know what would have happened back there ."
"i mean ."
"i know what i wanted to happen . ''"
"`` and ... what 's that ? ''"
"i ask softly , unable to look him in the eye ."
"`` i think you know , '' he says , circling my waist with his muscled arm ."
"`` but what i do n't know , at least for sure , is what you want out of this ."
"out of ... us . ''"
"my heart is lodged in my throat as i think of how to answer ."
"i need to be bold now ."
"to tell him the truth ."
"even if i 've read him entirely wrong , and he thinks i 'm insane for what i 'm about to say , we 'll be out of each others ' lives in a few months ' time ."
"so , here goes ."
"`` if we had n't been interrupted , '' i say , softly but steadily , `` i would n't have stopped until we 'd had each other ."
"that 's all i wanted . ''"
"he glances down at me , and i force myself to meet his gaze ."
"his eyes smolder with wanting me ."
"the intensity of his lust nearly bowls me over ."
"`` that 's what i wanted , too , '' he growls , catching my chin in his hand ."
"he brings his mouth to mine , kissing me forcefully , deeply ."
"but there 's a hint of finality in his kiss that nearly brings me to tears ."
"`` what are we supposed to do ? ''"
"i whisper , pulling away from him ."
"`` it 's wednesday ."
"no , thursday now ."
"by sunday , we 'll technically be siblings . ''"
"`` i know that , '' emerson replies , his teeth gritted in hopeless frustration ."
"`` and once that 's the case , we ca n't ... '' `` i know , '' i whisper ."
"`` of course we ca n't ."
"it would n't be right . ''"
"`` nothing about this situation is right , '' he scoffs ."
"`` god , '' i mutter , `` why could n't we have just found each other years ago , before we were out of time ? ''"
"`` we 're not out of time ."
"yet , '' emerson says carefully , as if testing the waters ."
"my heart clenches tightly as he goes on ."
"`` tomorrow is my birthday , abby ."
"saturday is yours ."
"that means that on saturday , and only on saturday , we 'll both be legal adults ."
"legal , unrelated adults ."
"who can argue with that ? ''"
"`` are you ... are you suggesting ... ? ''"
"i reply , my eyes going wide ."
"`` if i do n't at least suggest it , '' emerson says , pulling me into his lap ."
"`` i 'll regret it for the rest of my life ."
"so , yes ."
"this is me telling you that i want you , abby ."
"i want to be with you ."
"i want us to have each other , if only once in our lives ."
"i 'm suggesting that we give ourselves that before it 's too late ."
"you can tell me i 'm nuts , or to go fuck myself , or whatever you like ."
"but i have to at least tell you ... that that 's what i want . ''"
"`` well , emerson , '' i say , struggling to take a deep breath , `` that 's convenient ."
"because i ... want that ... too . ''"
"we stare at each other for a long moment before bursting into uproarious laughter ."
"gut-bursting , tension-relieving , hysterical laughter that almost sends us both toppling off the platform at once ."
"i throw my arms around emerson 's shoulders as we both roar at the insane , absurd hilarity of this whole situation ."
"a wave of relief crashes through me as laugher wracks my body ."
"god , it feels good to let some of this pressure release ."
"`` that might be the most awkward thing i 've ever said in my life ! ''"
"i crow , wiping tears from my eyes ."
"`` this may be the most awkward conversation that 's ever occurred between two people , '' emerson replies , `` 'hey , i know you 're about to be my sister , but i really want to do you . '"
"''"
"that sets us off again ."
"we collapse into each other until we end up lying on our backs , chests heaving , staring up at the stars ."
"our hands are clasped , our smiles wide ."
"despite the crapiness of the whole situation , here we are together ."
"on the same page ."
"`` promise me it will happen , '' i say to him ."
"`` promise me that on my birthday , we 'll get to be together ."
"the way we want to be . ''"
"`` i promise , '' emerson says , giving me a sweet , chaste kiss on the forehead ."
"`` but ."
"um ."
"i hope you do n't mind if i ask another sort of awkward question , '' emerson goes on , his fingers tightening ever-so-slightly ."
"`` shoot , '' i tell him , turning my head his way ."
"`` well ."
"you know , i 'm no novice , when it comes to sex , '' he begins , delightfully blunt as ever ."
"`` i 've been with a few girls in my time ."
"but in your case ... i guess what i mean is ... have you ever ... ? ''"
"my smiles fades at once as i jerk my face away from his ."
"he senses my entire body tense up in the wake of his question ."
"`` shit , '' he groans , `` that was so stupid of me- '' `` no , '' i cut him off , steeling myself for what i have to say , now ."
"`` no , it was n't stupid ."
"it 's just ... not an easy question for me to answer ."
"that does n't mean i 'm not going to , it 's just ... bear with me . ''"
"he squeezes my hand , but does n't say a word ."
"i take a breath and go on ."
"`` i was going to tell you this earlier ."
"when we were trading secrets ."
"i wanted to explain what happened at the diner tonight , but i was afraid that you ... anyway ."
"the short answer to your question is , yes , i 've had sex before ."
"the slightly longer answer is that i did n't really want to ."
"did n't want to at all , actually . ''"
"`` oh , abby ... '' emerson says , his voice as soft as i 've ever heard it ."
"`` do you mean- ? ''"
"`` it was back in freshman year , '' i go on , plowing ahead before i lose my nerve ."
"`` i was sort of a late bloomer , so i was really only beginning to get attention from some guys at our school ."
"there was one in particular that i 'd had a crush on since about kindergarten ."
"he and i were at the other middle school , not yours ."
"anyway , he teased me pretty mercilessly through eighth grade-for being smart , for always having my nose in a sketchbook , all that ."
"but come high school , that teasing gave way to flirting ."
"and we started , uh , hanging out ."
"right when my mom died , he was still sort of in the picture ."
"we were n't dating or anything , but we were spending time together ."
"i went over to his place one night when my dad was wasted , just to get out of the house for a minute ."
"his parents were away , so it was just us ."
"he 'd broken into his dad 's liquor cabinet and offered me something to drink ."
"said it would make me feel better ."
"i had some booze , he gave me more ."
"he over-poured my drinks ."
"i got drunk ."
"then he started touching me , pushing me further than we 'd been before ."
"by then , we 'd only really kissed ."
"but he was feeling me up , trying to undress me ."
"i told him to stop , i was too wasted to enjoy it , to want it ."
"but he kept on me ."
"said that would make me feel better , too ."
"he was much bigger than me , and i was so far gone ."
"i passed out in the struggle ."
"when i woke up a few hours later , i was naked from the waist down ."
"he was asleep ."
"passed out ."
"there was some blood on my thighs , and ... you know ... everything else ."
"i got dressed , went home , and took a shower ."
"he and i never spoke again ."
"the only other person who knows this besides you is riley ."
"but i need you to know ."
"it 's important to me that you do . ''"
"a heavy , thick cloud of silence descends as emerson 's jaw pulses with rage ."
"`` this guy , '' he says , his voice ragged , `` it was tucker ."
"was n't it ? ''"
"`` yes , '' i whisper , `` yes ."
"it was . ''"
"`` abby , i 'm so sorry , '' emerson says , `` i 'm so sorry that happened to you ."
"i 'm sorry no one was there to help you ."
"if i 'd known- '' `` what , you would have beat him up for me ? ''"
"i tease , trying to force a little bit of levity into my confession ."
"`` for starters , '' emerson says resolutely ."
"`` that would n't fix anything , '' i reply ."
"`` even if i 'd told someone , no one would have believed me ."
"i only would have gotten a reputation for being a lying whore at school ."
"with his popularity , his family 's reputation in town ... i would n't have stood a chance ."
"i 'd rather get to leave this place behind and forget about every one of these assholes than give them the satisfaction of dragging me through the mud . ''"
"`` i just ... i wish there was anything i could do for you , '' emerson says , `` to make things better ."
"anything . ''"
"`` this is a pretty good start , '' i tell him , giving his hand a squeeze ."
"`` we ca n't change the past , you know ."
"but we do get to decide what the future looks like . ''"
"`` right , '' he says softly , tucking my hair behind my ear ."
"`` you 're right . ''"
"the sky is just starting to lighten overhead as we make our way back inside ."
"we have school later today , as mundane as it is to think of ."
"we pause at the top of the stairs , just before peeling off toward our own rooms ."
"emerson lays his hands on my bare upper arms , looking at me intently ."
"`` thank you for telling me everything , '' he whispers , `` it means so much that you can trust me with that . ''"
"`` i 'd trust you with anything , '' i reply , taking his face in my hands ."
"standing on my tiptoes , i kiss him earnestly , swiftly ."
"this time , he does n't hold what i want just out of reach ."
"we step away from each other and dart into our rooms ."
"as my face hits the pillow at last , i realize the enormity of everything that 's come to pass in these last 24 hours ."
"the diner incident ."
"the impromptu date night and steamy make out session with emerson ."
"dad and deb 's big announcement ."
"my confession to emerson ."
"our agreement for my eighteenth birthday ."
"`` man , '' i sigh , drifting off to sleep , `` i 'd better give this to riley in small doses , or else she 's going to lose her shit ."
"permanently . ''"
"chapter six sure enough , my best friend is flabbergasted and delighted when i give her the scoop of all that 's gone down with me since last we spoke ."
"we 've decided to spend gym class huddled at the top of the football field bleachers , now that our teacher has given up on trying to make us participate in class ."
"it 's a good thing , too , because the squeal that riley emits when i let her in on my and emerson 's plans for saturday would be enough to burst any unaccustomed eardrums ."
"`` what the fucking fuck ?"
"! ''"
"she shrieks , shoving her hands through her black curls ."
"`` this is too much ."
"in the best way possible ."
"where is it gon na go down ?"
"what are you gon na wear ?"
"what if the sex is just too good and you have to rush off and elope just to beat your parents to the punch so that they 're the fucked up ones ?"
"what if- ? ''"
"`` whoa , whoa ."
"slow down , tiger , '' i laugh , `` neither of us expects this to be a long term thing ."
"it ca n't be , with our parents getting married ."
"we 'd probably hardly even see each other after graduation , anyway , even if they were n't tying the knot ."
"this is a onetime thing ."
"a gift to ourselves ."
"please do n't get your hopes up for some happy ending . ''"
"`` who do you think you 're talking to ? ''"
"she scoffs , `` my imagination can wring a happy ending out of any situation ."
"i 'm holding out hope for you two . ''"
"`` i wish i had your optimism then , '' i laugh ."
"`` really , i do . ''"
"`` and i ca n't believe you told him about ... you know , '' she says , growing somber ."
"`` you must really trust this guy , huh ? ''"
"`` i know it 's crazy , but i really do , '' i tell her ."
"`` it might blow up in my face and ruin me for life , but hey , nothing 's been able to ruin me yet ."
"so , i like my chances . ''"
"`` see ?"
"you 're plenty optimistic , '' riley says , raising an eyebrow ."
"`` well ."
"optimistic-ish . ''"
"later that evening , i 'm curled up on the couch going through some mind-numbing calculus homework ."
"i have my headphones in , trying to drown out deb and dad 's pre-wedding chatter with some kings of leon ."
"they 're huddled over the kitchen table , going over the last-minute plans for their spur-of-the-moment wedding ceremony and honeymoon ."
"i ca n't even think about how excruciating it will be for emerson and i to be alone here for the whole week of their honeymoon , unable to touch each other ever again ."
"maybe riley will let me crash at her place ."
"or i guess i could just invest in a chastity belt ."
"`` hey honey ! ''"
"deb chirps happily as emerson strolls in through the front door ."
"i look up as he enters and tug out an earbud , in case we 're all about to have a family meeting ."
"`` hi mom , '' he replies shortly ."
"to my surprise , he makes a beeline to where i 'm sitting on the couch and plops down next to me ."
"i feel unaccountably nervous to be near him in our parents ' presence ."
"what if they can sense what 's gone on between us ?"
"but of course , they 're oblivious to the end ."
"for once , their narcissism is working in our favor ."
"`` our best man and maid of honor , here together , '' deb goes on , clasping her manicured hands in elation ."
"`` when did that get decided ? ''"
"i ask under my breath ."
"`` do n't look at me , '' emerson replies , `` it 's the first i 'm hearing of it . ''"
"`` we 'll need you kids up bright and early on sunday morning , '' my dad calls over to us ."
"`` we 've got the justice of the peace booked from noon until half past ."
"got ta make it snappy . ''"
"`` how romantic , '' i observe ."
"`` and guess what else , '' dad goes on , his cheerfulness dwindling just a hair , `` grandma jillian and grandpa frank are going to be here to celebrate . ''"
"`` really ? ''"
"i ask , raising my eyebrows ."
"my grandparents , frank and jillian rowan , adore me , but their relationship with my dad is rather spotty ."
"grandpa frank is pretty critical of my dad 's history of `` freeloading '' off their old money ."
"`` they insisted , '' my dad smiles tightly ."
"it 's actually something of a comfort that dad does n't get along with his parents , either ."
"just goes to show that it runs in the family ."
"grandma and grandpa have been supporting our little family since i was born ."
"they really adored my mom , sandy , and pretty clearly thought she was doing my dad a favor by sticking around ."
"most of the money for my schooling , clothing , and extracurriculars still comes from them ."
"they 've even offered to pay my way through college ."
"well , whatever i ca n't cover with scholarships , that is ."
"`` well ."
"i 'll be sure to get to the church on time , '' emerson says with sarcastic enthusiasm ."
"`` but i wo n't be around much beforehand . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"i ask , whipping around to face him ."
"what the hell is he talking about ?"
"he has to be around ."
"`` what do you mean , emerson ? ''"
"deb presses her son ."
"`` a friend of mine is throwing me an eighteenth birthday party at his parents ' beach house this weekend ."
"a whole bunch of people are going to be there , '' emerson says casually ."
"`` is that so ? ''"
"i whisper , my stomach flipping over ."
"he 's ditching me , and our rather important plans , to hang out at the beach ?"
"`` oh ... well , that 's nice ! ''"
"deb smiles ."
"`` you 've always been such a popular boy , emerson ."
"it 's good that you 'll be with your friends on your birthday . ''"
"`` uh-huh , '' emerson says , examining his fingernails ."
"`` guess it 'll just be the three of us celebrating your birthday then , abby , '' my dad says ."
"`` so it would seem , '' i reply , glaring at emerson ."
"i can feel a hard knot forming in my throat ."
"was he just messing with me last night , when he told me that he wanted me ?"
"has he been telling all his friends about how his pervy almost-stepsister secretly wants to jump his bones ?"
"i ca n't believe i let my guard down ."
"i should know better than to trust anyone at all ."
"`` actually , you know what ? ''"
"emerson says , finally shifting his gaze my way , `` my friends probably would n't mind too much if you tagged along , abby ."
"i 've got a spare seat in the car . ''"
"`` you ... i ... what ? ''"
"i stammer , uncomprehendingly ."
"`` oh , you should go , abby ! ''"
"deb says enthusiastically , `` you do n't want to hang out with us old farts on your birthday ."
"go have fun with emerson and his friends !"
"do n't you think she should , bob ? ''"
"`` sure , '' my dad says , `` sounds like it could be a fun time for you kids . ''"
"`` what do you say , abby ? ''"
"emerson asks ."
"there 's a glint in his blue eyes , a spark of secrecy ."
"i do n't quite know what he 's up to , or why he 's scrapped our plans for the weekend , but anything would be better than being stuck here alone with our parents on my birthday ."
"`` ok , '' i say flatly , leaning back against the couch ."
"`` sounds ... great . ''"
"`` as long as you 're on time for the wedding , '' my dad reminds us warningly ."
"`` super , '' emerson grins , snatching away the bag of milano cookies i 've been noshing on ."
"`` we 'll leave tomorrow after school ."
"get as much out of the weekend as we can . ''"
"`` sounds good , bro , '' i say , glowering at him as he steals my snack ."
"`` oh , is n't that just so precious ? ''"
"deb grins , as emerson disappears upstairs ."
"i watch his retreating back , my mind reeling ."
"i 'm hurt , and confused , and incredibly disappointed about our plans being scattered ."
"how can he think it 's ok to just blow me off like this , after everything i shared with him last night ?"
"it does n't make any sense ."
"he seemed just as eager to have some ... alone time together as i did ."
"what the hell gives ?"
"my concentration has been absolutely demolished ."
"there 's no way i 'm getting any more homework done today ."
"unwilling to listen to my parents ' sickly-sweet chatter , i head up to my own room , lock the door , and whip out my battery-operated boyfriend ."
"if i 'm not going to get any action this weekend after all , i 'd better stock up on the self love every chance i get ."
"i 'm well accustomed to taking care of myself , anyway ."
"still smarting from emerson 's dismissal , i leave for the school the next morning without even sticking around to wish him a happy birthday ."
"i halfway expect the rest of the student body to burst out laughing as i hurry into school , convinced that emerson will have spread the word about what a dramatic weirdo i am ."
"but as usual , my entrance into homeroom goes unnoticed by all my peers save riley ."
"my best friend waves me over , noticing at once that i 'm in a terrible mood ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"she asks , as i sit down beside her ."
"`` oh , you know , '' i sigh , `` just everything in the entire world . ''"
"without a word , she takes my hand and tows me toward the classroom door ."
"our teacher , a beleaguered , balding man in his forties , looks up from his game of computer solitaire as we march past ."
"`` excuse me , '' he says testily ."
"`` where do you ladies think you 're going ? ''"
"without missing a beat , riley spins around to face him , plants a hand on her hip , and says , `` we both just got our periods simultaneously ."
"they 're super heavy too ."
"like , horror-movie level ."
"so we 're gon na go take care of our woman issues together ."
"ok ?"
"bye ! ''"
"the teacher 's face drains of color as we traipse out of the room and slam the door behind us ."
"the rest of our schoolmates are in their classrooms already , so we 're all alone as we beat a quick path through the halls and hole up in one of the girls ' bathrooms ."
"we squeeze ourselves into one of the larger stalls and settle down for a good long talk ."
"riley cracks a window so that she can enjoy a gossip-session cigarette , and i tell her about emerson 's surreptitious change of plans for the weekend ."
"`` that does n't make any sense , '' she says , putting her smoke out on the windowsill ."
"`` tell me about it ! ''"
"i exclaim , letting my head fall back against the tile wall ."
"`` there 's got to be more to it , '' she says resolutely ."
"`` why would he all but profess his love for you one night- ? ''"
"`` he professed his wanting to bone me , '' i correct her , `` not his love . ''"
"`` right , '' riley says , rolling her eyes , `` why would he profess his whatever , only to leave you high and dry ?"
"does n't follow . ''"
"`` you 're the expert on man-brains , '' i reply , `` you tell me what i 'm supposed to make of all this . ''"
"`` just wait it out , '' she tells me , resting her hands on my shoulders ."
"`` i 'm sure there 's an explanation , here . ''"
"having unloaded some of my frustration , i feel like i can at least make it through the rest of the day without exploding ."
"we 'll see how i feel once i 'm cooped up in some beach house with a bunch of emerson 's buddies ."
"as i step out of the girl 's bathroom with riley right behind me , i very nearly crash into a wall of person that appears out of nowhere ."
"`` christ , '' i mutter , stepping out of the way just in time ."
"`` watch where you're- '' `` there you are , '' a very familiar voice says ."
"`` i was looking for you . ''"
"i glance up only to find emerson 's blue eyes looking back at me ."
"i do my best to tamp down my automatic excitement at seeing him ."
"ca n't let him get me all riled up , now ."
"`` oh ? ''"
"i say , feigning indifference ."
"`` and why were you looking for me ? ''"
"`` because we 're getting out of here , '' he replies , as if it 's the most obvious thing in the world ."
"`` right now ."
"let 's go . ''"
"`` i thought you said we were heading out after school ? ''"
"i reply , even more confused ."
"`` i say a lot of things , '' emerson shrugs , `` but right now , i 'm saying that you and i are getting in my chevy and blowing this pop stand ."
"what , are you afraid to miss math class or something , miss rowan ? ''"
"`` do n't be an ass , '' i mutter ."
"`` if you 're so hell-bent on leaving now , fine ."
"it 's your freakin ' birthday , after all . ''"
"`` that 's the spirit , '' he grins , turning on his heel ."
"`` let 's go , sis . ''"
"he walks away toward the student parking lot , and i turn to stare at riley , bewildered ."
"`` what are you waiting for ? ''"
"she whispers , giving me a little push , `` go with him ! ''"
"`` all right , all right , '' i mutter , and set off after emerson ."
"i 've never straight-up ditched school before , but i ca n't let him see that i 'm nervous about this little operation ."
"struggling to appear cool as a cucumber , i duck through the front doors on his heels and hurry over to his chevy ."
"holding my breath as i slide into the passenger seat , it occurs to me as strange that there 's no one else hitching a ride with us ."
"i thought we 'd be transporting at least a couple of emerson 's meat head friends to the beach with us ."
"emerson steers the chevy out of the school parking lot , and for a moment it seems that we 're totally in the clear ."
"that is , until the security guard at the front gates looks up from his crossword puzzle with a scowl ."
"`` you might want to duck down in your seat a little , '' emerson tells me ."
"i obey , without daring to ask why ."
"the security guard lumbers out of his hutch , signaling for us to stop ."
"emerson eases up on the gas as we approach , rolling toward the gates ."
"but just as we 're coming up on the school guard , my reckless companion floors it ."
"with a rabid whirr of the engine , we fly past the baffled guard and swing out onto the main road out of town ."
"i swallow down a terrified yelp as i watch our school shrink behind us in the rearview mirror ."
"`` desperate times , right ? ''"
"emerson laughs , slapping the steering wheel with his palms ."
"`` i do n't understand why you 're so desperate to get to some stupid house party , '' i grumble , crossing my arms ."
"`` even if it is in honor of your birthday . ''"
"emerson raises an eyebrow at me , an amused grin spreading across his face ."
"`` holy shit , abby , '' he crows , laughing at my surly expression ."
"`` you are , hands down , the most gullible person on the planet ."
"did you seriously think- ? ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"i ask , sitting up a little straighter , `` did i think what ? ''"
"`` did you seriously think i was going to blow off what we planned for some stupid birthday party ?"
"damn ."
"i must be a better liar than i thought , '' he chuckles , pulling out a cigarette ."
"my heart inflates like a helium balloon as i catch his drift ."
"`` you mean , '' i breathe , `` we 're still on ?"
"for ... ? ''"
"`` of course we 're still on , '' he says , glancing my way ."
"`` you think i 'd actually miss the chance to follow through on my promise to you ?"
"you must be out of your damn mind , lady . ''"
"`` but then why- ?"
"what- ? ''"
"i stammer , smiling despite myself ."
"`` i had to feed bob and deb that house party bullshit , '' he explains , turning off onto the highway ramp ."
"`` they may be the two most oblivious , self-centered people on the continent , but even they would have been suspicious if their teenage son and daughter had announced they were going off on a romantic seaside retreat together . ''"
"`` you know something sawyer , '' i say , beaming at his brilliance , `` you 're a lot smarter than you look . ''"
"`` wish i could say the same for you , '' he scoffs playfully ."
"`` i ca n't believe you fell for that whole thing . ''"
"`` guess my heart is just too pure and wholesome for my own good , '' i kid , fluttering my eyelashes daintily ."
"`` or you 're just gullible as hell , '' emerson replies , cranking up the radio and laying on the speed as we soar along the highway ."
"in a matter of minutes , my heart has been entirely mended ."
"emerson had no intention of abandoning me after all , and certainly did n't run off and spread my secrets around the school behind my back ."
"but as happy as i am to be back on track with him , a little part of me is worried about the intensity of my reaction to the mere idea of losing him ."
"his smallest action has the power to send me soaring to new heights of bliss or drag me down to devastating lows ."
"i 've never intentionally let someone hold that much sway over my heart and mind ."
"never cared so much for someone to the point of trusting them so fully ."
"i have every reason to think that i can trust emerson not to hurt me ."
"but clearly , i 'm having trouble putting any weight on that faith in him ."
"i ca n't go into this half-heartedly ."
"if i make the choice to trust him , be vulnerable and open with him , then i 've got to charge full speed ahead ."
"the quickest way to ruin this thing we 've got is to hold back from each other ."
"we both risked a lot even telling each other how we feel ."
"we 've come so close to breaking through each others ' iron-clad defenses ."
"it 's time to lower the walls once and for all ."
"as we race along in emerson 's chevy , i reach for his hand ."
"without missing a beat , he gives my hand a squeeze , letting me know that i 'm safe and sound with him ."
"if i 'm honest with myself , i 've known that all along ."
"and that might be the scariest part of this whole thing ."
"chapter seven at least one part of emerson 's story was true-we are , in fact , spending the weekend at the beach ."
"only , instead of shacking up with a bunch of other kids in someone 's rich parents ' beach house , we 're staying in a tiny motel in a room of our own ."
"i tease emerson as we pull up to the place ."
"`` a motel ?"
"seriously ? ''"
"i smile , grabbing my backpack ."
"`` bit of a cliche , is n't it ? ''"
"`` i can set up a tent on the beach if you 'd rather , '' he shoots back , `` but this place has hbo ."
"so i hope you wo n't mind if i do n't join you . ''"
"we get our keys from the front office , only drawing a slightly suspicious look from the man behind the desk ."
"but hey , emerson 's eighteen now , and has the id to prove it ."
"that 'll take a little getting used to-the whole being able to do whatever we please thing ."
"it may not be a huge deal , booking a motel room of our own , but it 's cool all the same ."
"it 's a taste of adult independence , and damn is it thrilling ."
"though not nearly as thrilling as what 's set to go down in said motel room , that 's for damn sure ."
"we find our room at the end of a long line of doors ."
"the motel sits right on the edge of the dunes overlooking the long island sound ."
"the spring air is just cool enough to be refreshing , and the sun is just beginning to set over the water ."
"emerson pushes open our door , and we step over the threshold together ."
"my reservations about staying in a motel evaporate as i take in the space ."
"it 's a quaint , simple room , well kept and cozy ."
"i spot a deep bathtub through the open bathroom door , a huge window with a view of the sea ... and a big queen bed right in the center of the room ."
"seeing that big-enough-for-two bed makes this whole thing real for me ."
"i 'm finally going to sleep with emerson sawyer ."
"after all these years of wanting him from afar , he 's right here beside me ."
"we 're here with each other ."
"it 's almost too good to be true ."
"do n't think that , i chide myself , the second you think something 's too good to be true , it usually is ."
"`` well , '' emerson says with a smile ."
"`` i 'm starving ."
"you gon na take me out for a birthday dinner or what ? ''"
"`` since you asked so nicely , '' i roll my eyes , `` sure ."
"where do you want to go ? ''"
"he knows a place nearby , and drives us over to get some grub ."
"it 's a tiny , seaside shack with maybe a dozen tables ."
"the menu is heavy on seafood and regional staples ."
"there 's a warmth to the place that can only be captured during the offseason at a sleepy beach town ."
"in short , it 's perfect ."
"we settle down into a table by the window and tuck into our complementary basket of biscuits ."
"the buttery , flaky pastry makes my eyes flutter closed with pleasure ."
"i have n't eaten anything all day ."
"`` how 'd you know about this place ? ''"
"i ask emerson , perusing the menu ."
"`` my dad used to take me here when i was little , '' he replies , looking out the wide front windows toward the docks ."
"`` we 'd come out fishing early in the morning , then stop here for lunch before driving home ."
"it 's not fancy , but it 's one of my favorite places in the world . ''"
"his face takes on a cast of sadness as he talks about his dad ."
"it occurs to me that i barely know anything about emerson 's father , or what happened to him ."
"i try to open up the conversation as delicately as possible ."
"`` does he still live around here , your dad ? ''"
"i ask carefully , reaching for another biscuit ."
"`` in a way , '' emerson laughs roughly ."
"`` i mean , he 's still in the state ."
"or should i say , in state . ''"
"`` your dad 's ... incarcerated ? ''"
"i ask , pausing in my one-woman biscuit-scarfing contest ."
"`` you do n't have to be so formal about it , '' emerson replies ."
"`` he 's locked up ."
"has been for most of my life . ''"
"`` wow ... '' i breathe , unsure of what to say ."
"`` that 's ... so rough ."
"i 'm sorry . ''"
"`` i 'm pretty used to the arrangement by now , '' he says ."
"`` but thanks . ''"
"`` do you mind if i ask ... i mean , you do n't have to go into it ... '' i fumble ."
"`` no , it 's ok , '' emerson replies , `` you 've told me so much about your past , it 's only fair that i be open with you too . ''"
"we pause our conversation long enough to place our orders with the young , friendly waitress ."
"once she 's taken our menus away and left us alone once more emerson takes a breath and begins ."
"`` my parents got married pretty young , '' he tells me , `` for a while , they really were happy ."
"they never had much in the way of money , but when you look at old pictures of them , it always looks like they 're having a blast ."
"it was n't until they started trying to start a family that things got sort of ... complicated . ''"
"`` complicated how ? ''"
"i ask ."
"`` complicated in that it did n't work for them at first , '' emerson goes on ."
"`` they kept trying to get pregnant without any luck ."
"their doctors told them that fertility treatments , ivf and all , might help things along ."
"the problem is , those treatments cost money , and my parents did n't have any ."
"but they were hell bent on having a kid , so my dad-peter-decided to get a little creative with the whole money-making thing . ''"
"`` and when you say creative ... '' i prompt him ."
"`` i mean he started selling drugs to make some extra money , '' emerson says bluntly ."
"`` nothing major ."
"just weed , mostly ."
"and it worked , too-they were able to rake in enough extra cash that ivf was suddenly on the table ."
"my mom was finally able to get pregnant with yours truly ."
"which was all well and good , until i was eight or so ."
"that 's when the dealing finally caught up with my dad ."
"he was n't just selling the drugs ."
"both my parents had already started having issues with substance abuse by then , and my dad got in a really nasty car accident while under the influence that brought everything out into the open ."
"he went away , my mom got worse , and i was left to take care of it all ."
"i did , too ."
"i have been since i was eight ."
"i mean , it 's because they wanted me so badly that they started down that road at all ."
"it only seems fair , you know ? ''"
"`` emerson , '' i say softly , reaching for his hands across the table , `` you know that none of that is your fault , right ? ''"
"`` oh , sure , '' emerson shrugs , `` i know that ."
"in theory ."
"but it 's hard not to feel kind of obligated to them now , no matter how badly they mess up . ''"
"`` i know what you mean , '' i nod , `` i feel the same way about my dad ."
"like , since he lost mom , i always have to be there for him , even if he barely gives me the time of day . ''"
"`` look at us , '' emerson laughs , `` a couple of bleeding hearts . ''"
"`` i guess so , '' i smile ."
"our bountiful plates of food arrive-crab cakes for emerson , vegetable pot pie for me-and we dig in eagerly , plowing through every bite of buttery , flavorful goodness ."
"we even go in for a couple slices of blueberry pie to top things off ."
"i 'm surprised we do n't roll out of the restaurant at the end of our meal ."
"by the time we make it back to the motel , we 're happy , sleepy , and more than a little handsy ."
"my every nerve sizzles with anticipation as emerson unlocks our motel room love nest and walks in before me ."
"he flops onto the soft queen bed , and i tentatively ease myself down next to him ."
"the whole being-alone thing is still so novel for us that i find myself feeling a little shy ."
"emerson can sense that i 'm still getting my bearings , so he just lets me curl against his side there on the bed ."
"his arms close around me as i press my back against his chest ."
"we drift into a post-dinner nap , the sound of the waves cocooning us as we lay there ."
"even in half-slumber , i can feel my body responding to emerson 's ."
"our chests rise and fall together , our limbs shifting to accommodate each other ."
"it 's so simple , so easy ."
"like we were built for each other ."
"by all rights , i should be feeling so much pressure and anxiety about what we 've promised to give each other this weekend ."
"but i 've never felt more at peace ."
"i do n't know how much time goes by before i turn myself to face emerson there on the bed ."
"his blue eyes ease open as i lay my head next to his on the pillow ."
"our mouths twist into matching grins as he runs a hand along the curve of my waist , and i rest my hands on his chest ."
"without a word , he brings his lips to my neck , kissing me slow and deep ."
"my back arches as his lips move down my throat , across my clavicle , over my chest ."
"my blonde hair is splayed across the pillow beneath me as i writhe blissfully at his touch ."
"i run my fingers through his tousled chestnut hair , tugging him closer toward me ."
"as i press myself flush against his body , i can feel that he 's growing harder by the second , just from kissing me ."
"god , that 's hot ."
"his lips continue to caress every inch of skin they can find as he slips his hand beneath my gray sweater ."
"the touch of his hand is cool against my flushed skin as he trails up my flat stomach , the tips of his fingers brushing against my ribs ."
"i hold my breath as i feel him reach around my back and unclasp my bra with a flick of his wrist ."
"`` someone 's had a lot of practice with bra clasps , '' i tease breathlessly ."
"`` what can i say , '' he grins , `` i 've have very capable hands . ''"
"he finally brings his lips to mine as he cups my breast in his hand , running his thumb ever-so-lightly over my hard nipple ."
"that slight touch sends a pang of desire straight into my core , radiating out through my entire body ."
"his tongue glances against mine , and i kiss him back , deeper and more urgently with every passing moment ."
"i feel his hand skirting along my torso as i let my own fingers trail down the hard , rippling line of his abs ."
"he groans softly as i trace the length of his stiff member through his jeans ."
"i take a deep breath as emerson pops open the button of my jeans ."
"pulling me close , he slips his hand between my jeans and panties ."
"my sex is aching for his touch , and i ca n't help but let my knees fall apart , spreading my legs wider for him ."
"his fingertips brush against the thin panel of cotton covering me , already wet with desire for him ."
"i grab onto handfuls of bedding as he pushes aside my panties and rests two strong fingers against my throbbing sex ."
"`` emerson , '' i breathe , my head falling back against the pillow as he traces a long , slow line along my slit ."
"i ca n't form any other word besides his name , whisper it over and over again as he strokes me , parting me a little deeper each time ."
"i bury my face in his chest as he roves along my sex , laying those two expert fingers against the hard nub of my clit ."
"i 've never been touched like this by a guy , never gotten off with anything that was n't battery-operated before ."
"for the briefest moment , i worry about whether or not i 'll be able to come with him ."
"that is , before he starts tracing long , slow circles around that bundle of nerves , rubbing with just the right amount of force ."
"a sweet , aching pressure starts to build in my core as he picks up the pace , rubbing and flicking my clit in a way i 've never felt before ."
"my back arches as he goes on , switching up speed and motion just at the right moment , never leaving me hanging for a second ."
"my mouth falls open with wonder as i reach my tipping point ."
"i 'm right on the edge of spilling over with pleasure when he says : `` come for me , abby . ''"
"and i do , a shudder of bliss rolls through my body as i clutch onto him with all my might ."
"i 've had orgasms of my own creation before , but never have i come with another person ."
"and certainly not for another person ."
"spent , i fall back against the bed , my chest heaving ."
"emerson lays down beside me , resting a hand on my stomach ."
"`` holy shit ... '' i breathe , `` i think you 've killed me . ''"
"`` i could n't help myself , '' he murmurs , `` nothing turns me on like seeing you let go ."
"it 's the sexiest thing , abby ."
"you have no idea . ''"
"`` so then ... are we gon na ... ? ''"
"i ask , glancing down at his gorgeous body ."
"`` nope ."
"we already decided on tomorrow , '' he grins mischievously , `` that was just to hold you over . ''"
"`` what ?"
"! ''"
"i exclaim , `` but- '' `` we 're sticking to the plan , '' he says firmly ."
"`` tomorrow , when you 're no longer a the younger woman , it 'll be a different story . ''"
"`` ugghh , '' i groan , burying my face in my hands ."
"`` guess you have a lot more will power than i do , then , '' i tell him ."
"`` i like the thrill of the chase , '' he grins ."
"`` hey , '' i say , with mock sternness , `` do n't torment me , now , or i wo n't give you your real birthday present . ''"
"`` you got me a present ? ''"
"he asks , seeming genuinely touched ."
"`` it 's nothing , really , '' i reply , wanting to temper his expectations some ."
"`` just ... i thought you might like it , so ... '' `` well , come on then ! ''"
"he exclaims , sitting upright , `` show me the goods ! ''"
"`` are n't you supposed to be a grownup now or something , emerson ? ''"
"i shoot back , feigning impatience as i swing my feet over onto the floor ."
"really , i think his enthusiasm is downright adorable ."
"`` nah ."
"i do n't plan on being a grownup anytime soon ."
"being a legal adult is n't going to change that , '' he declares ."
"`` hey , we should drink to that . ''"
"`` drink ? ''"
"i ask , as i grab my backpack off the floor ."
"`` i know your dad just keeps this stuff in the house for company , '' emerson goes on , snatching up his own overnight bag , `` so i figured he would n't mind if we pilfered some ."
"dude had , like , twenty bottles in the basement ."
"how 's that for willpower ? ''"
"i watch as emerson produces a bottle of champagne , and ca n't help but giggle ."
"`` how fancy of you , '' i say ."
"`` what ?"
"does n't champagne in a motel room just scream class to you ? ''"
"he shoots back , searching around his bag for an opener ."
"`` or something like that , '' i say , my fingers finally closing around the sketchbook i 've been hunting for ."
"i pull out the thick , weathered book as emerson pops open the bottle and pours us each a styrofoam cup of the bubbly ."
"`` here you go , ma'am , '' he smiles , handing me some champagne ."
"`` to not becoming grownups until they literally force us to , '' he says , holding up his cup ."
"`` here , here ! ''"
"i laugh , touching the lip of my cup to his ."
"the fizzy wine tickles my nose as i take a sip , savoring the sweetness ."
"`` thanks for the booze , dad , '' i add , tipping my cup in the general direction of our hometown ."
"`` oh no , '' emerson groans , glancing down at my hands , `` tell me you did n't get me a book for my birthday . ''"
"`` first of all , what 's so bad about getting a book as a present ?"
"that 's , like , the best present on the planet , '' i reply , and before he can protest i add , `` secondly , it 's not a book ."
"it 's just in a book ."
"here ... '' he watches as i peel open the well-loved pages ."
"somehow , this feels nearly as intimate as what just went down between us on the bed ."
"i hardly ever show my sketchbook to anyone , yet here i am , flipping through the pages as emerson looks on ."
"sharing my art with someone has always felt impossible , something that required far too much trust for me to be able to do ."
"but emerson 's teaching me that trust is n't something that 's off-limits to me just because of my history ."
"and i 'm even starting to believe him ."
"`` are those all yours ? ''"
"he asks , his eyes glued to the pages ."
"`` yep , '' i reply , `` all of them . ''"
"`` they 're amazing , '' he says reverently , as i linger on a drawing of a stylized , distorted landscape ."
"`` please tell me you 're going to major in art when you go to school in the fall . ''"
"`` oh , i do n't know , '' i demur , `` i might try and focus on something a little more practical . ''"
"`` fuck practical ."
"these are incredible drawings , '' he exclaims ."
"`` well ... who knows ? ''"
"i allow , `` it 's not like there are any real jobs out there anyway , right ?"
"might as well major in something i actually like . ''"
"`` that 's the spirit ."
"i think , '' emerson replies ."
"finally , i come to the sketch i 've been looking for ."
"it 's right at the end of the book , my most recent finished piece ."
"drawing a steadying breath , i turn the sketchbook around and pass it to emerson ."
"his eyes fall on the elaborate sketch and go wide ."
"he drinks in the image for a long moment before finally looking up at me ."
"`` is this ... ? ''"
"he asks ."
"`` it is , '' i assure him , smiling at his amazement ."
"`` it 's you . ''"
"we study the drawing together ."
"it 's a portrait of emerson i 've been working on for weeks , since our first heated exchange at that party ."
"the drawing shows him in half-profile , staring with determined purpose from the page ."
"i 'm really proud of how i was able to capture him , and i can tell he 's impressed with the effort ."
"`` this is how you see me ? ''"
"he asks , his voice surprisingly soft ."
"`` absolutely , '' i tell him ."
"`` to me , that 's the essence of who you are ."
"intelligent , strong , unwilling to back down from what you know is right ."
"from the things you want out of life . ''"
"`` can i ... can i keep this ? ''"
"he asks , looking up at me imploringly ."
"`` of course ! ''"
"i tell him , `` it 's for you , emerson ."
"i want you to have it , always . ''"
"placing the sketchbook down with great reverence , emerson leans forward and catches my lips in his ."
"`` thank you , '' he murmurs , running a hand through my hair ."
"`` it 's the best gift anyone 's ever given me . ''"
"i smile and lower myself onto my knees in front of him ."
"`` then you 're going to love this ... '' i say with my best seductive grin ."
"i slowly undo his belt and unzip his pants as he leans back , a look of utter disbelief on his face ."
"i can see the hardening outline of his staggering cock growing down the inside of his jeans and my mouth begins to water instinctively ."
"oh how i 've dreamed of this moment ."
"my heart feels like its going to beat out of my chest as he lifts his hips and i pull down his jeans and boxers , unleashing his throbbing dick ."
"it 's beautiful , i 've never seen one up close before , and his is absolutely amazing ."
"i grab it reverently , without thinking , and lower my mouth onto him , taking as much of emerson into my throat as possible ... chapter eight when the early morning light draws me back up from the depths of slumber , i 'm surprised to find that the bed beside me is empty ."
"i roll onto my side , peering around the hotel room for my missing companion ."
"even after one night , the feel of waking up without him does n't suit me ."
"i 'm just about to roll out of bed and go searching for him when the motel room door eases open ."
"emerson appears on the threshold , carrying two cups of takeout coffee and a paper bag ."
"he sees me sitting up in bed and freezes ."
"`` shit , '' he mutters ."
"`` good morning to you too , '' i say , raising an eyebrow ."
"`` no , it 's just ... i was going to surprise you , '' he says , closing the door behind him ."
"`` here-just pretend to be asleep . ''"
"`` emerson ... '' i moan ."
"`` come on , '' he pleads , turning his back to dump the contents of the bag onto the dresser ."
"`` for me ."
"please . ''"
"i flop back onto the bed and pull the covers over my head as emerson futzes with something across the room ."
"i hear the click of a lighter , the crinkling of the bag , and finally emerson saying , `` ok. open your eyes . ''"
"pulling the covers down ever-so-slightly , i feel my heart melt into a puddle of goo in my chest ."
"emerson is walking toward me with a little makeshift breakfast in bed ."
"there 's my coffee , some creamers , and a blueberry muffin with a couple candles in the shape of a 1 and 8 ."
"he places the tray in my lap with great ceremony , humming the happy birthday song ."
"`` go on ."
"make a wish before it gets all waxy , '' he instructs me ."
"i glance up at him , wondering what on earth else i can wish for now that he 's barreled into my life ."
"i wish that this all works out ... i think to myself ."
"somehow ."
"i blow out the candles , and emerson sits down next to me on the bed , his own coffee and muffin hand ."
"`` what did you wish for ? ''"
"he asks ."
"`` i 'll tell you ... if it ever comes true , '' i smile ."
"`` fair enough , '' he says ."
"`` happy birthday , abby . ''"
"`` thank you , '' i say , peeling the wrapper off my muffin ."
"`` adulthood is off to a pretty great start , do n't you think ? ''"
"the day only gets better from there ."
"after i treat myself to a long , hot bath and get dressed for the afternoon , emerson and i head down to the beach for a long walk ."
"we take our time , talking all the while about our pasts , our ideas , our notions about the future ."
"emerson 's planning on going to college , eventually ."
"but probably not this year ."
"i 'll be starting school in the fall , of course , but we do n't talk too much about that part-the never-seeing-each-other again part ."
"maybe we can find some way around the distance , if this whole thing does n't go up in flames ."
"but we 'll be step-siblings tomorrow , so maybe it will be better to stay away after all ."
"we do n't talk about that too much , either ."
"there 's a little town center with shops and cafes down the shore a little ways , and emerson lets me take my time window shopping ."
"i 'm not much for designers or labels , but i love vintage and handmade things ."
"there 's one store in particular that i go nuts for-a local artist 's shop that 's chock full of gorgeous , eclectic jewelry and handicrafts ."
"i fall in love with one piece especially-a slender silver ring the bears a single pearl ."
"it 's so elegant , so simple ... and unfortunately out of my price range ."
"but still , a girl can dream ."
"we spend the day wandering around the sleepy beach town , grabbing ice cream and coffee later on , sitting on the sand together , daring to dunk our toes in the still-icy water ."
"i field a few texts from riley , who claims `` i told you so '' right when i let her in on the real nature of my and emerson 's beach escape ."
"`` remember protection , '' she texts me , `` and call immediately after this is not a drill . ''"
"`` i promise to call you the second i get off , '' i reply , `` maybe even during , if you 're lucky . ''"
"`` do not play with my emotions , lady , '' riley warns me ."
"though i 'm more than excited for the night to finally arrive , i do feel a slight nervousness starting to trip me up ."
"i have n't really been with a guy since what happened with tucker all those years ago ."
"even though my memories of that night with him are hazy , i start to worry about flashbacks , or even just bad vibes ."
"obviously , emerson is nothing like tucker , and tonight will be nothing like the night of my assault ."
"but still , i ca n't help but be a tiny bit anxious ."
"tonight 's dinner is even more delectable than the last ."
"emerson takes me to a little italian place in town with the best pesto i 've tasted ... maybe ever ."
"after we 've polished off the last bites of birthday tiramisu , it 's time at last to head back to our room ."
"as if sensing the hush of anticipation , emerson cranks up the tunes on the way to the motel ."
"the postal service serenades us all the way back , and i hurry to throw on some iron and wine from my laptop the second we 're back in the room ."
"awkward silences are n't so terrible when sam beam croons over them , it turns out ."
"emerson and i both shuck off our outer layers , and he moves to open up a second bottle of champagne ."
"`` thanks , '' i tell him , accepting a cup of champagne and taking a generous swig ."
"`` just let me freshen up a little , i 'll be right out . ''"
"`` take your time , '' he tells me , his eyes lingering on his face ."
"he can tell something is a little off , but is nice enough not to say anything outright ."
"i duck into the bathroom , drinking down the rest of my champagne and studying myself in the mirror ."
"`` you can do this , '' i whisper , coaching myself through my nerves , `` you 've wanted this for years ."
"since before anything even happened with tucker ."
"emerson is amazing , and he cares about you , and ... and ... '' `` everything ok in there ? ''"
"emerson asks at the door ."
"`` yep ! ''"
"i reply , my voice an octave higher than it usually is , `` totally fine ! ''"
"`` abby , '' he says , in a voice that tells me he knows the truth , `` do you want to talk ? ''"
"sighing , i turn and gently pull open the bathroom door ."
"`` come on in , '' i say , trying to play off my embarrassment as i turn and sit on the edge of the tub ."
"`` so ."
"what 's going on up there ? ''"
"he asks , glancing up at my head ."
"`` tell me . ''"
"`` i 'm just ... it 's ... ''"
"i stammer , blushing as i try to string the words together ."
"`` we 've been talking about this all week ."
"you know ."
"the thing we decided to do today ... '' `` oh , i know all about the thing , '' emerson smiles ."
"`` and i still really want ... the thing to happen , '' i stumble ahead , `` but i 'm sort of out of practice ."
"i 've only ever done this once before , and that was n't such a great experience ."
"and i know it wo n't always be like that , but you actually know what you 're doing , and- '' `` hey , hey , '' emerson says , wrapping an arm around me ."
"`` it 's ok , abby ."
"i understand completely ."
"you do n't have to keep anything from me , you know that . ''"
"`` i guess i do , '' i say quietly ."
"`` look , '' emerson says , taking my face in his hand , `` i 'm crazy about you , abby ."
"and i always will be ."
"now , because this world is a shitty , unfair place , we do n't have always ."
"because tomorrow , our parents are swooping in to fuck everything up ."
"we only have tonight ."
"but i would rather miss out entirely on having you than force you into anything you do n't want to do ."
"ok ?"
"i want you to want this as much as i do ."
"and if any part of you is n't interested , or is uncomfortable , then we do n't have to do anything ."
"just tell me what you want . ''"
"i bring my hazel eyes to emerson 's , amazed by his level-headedness ."
"he 'd pass up on having sex on the only night we actually can out of respect for me ."
"i know , in this moment , that i can trust him ."
"and to be honest , i think i knew that all along ."
"i 'm ready for this ."
"`` what i want , '' i tell him , my voice dipping low once more , `` is for you to kiss me now . ''"
"he does n't have to be told twice ."
"emerson 's lips brush against mine , softly at first ."
"we warm to each other in an instant , leaving our cups of champagne by the wayside as our kiss becomes more earnest , more searching ."
"i wrap my arms around his broad shoulders , digging my hands into his chestnut hair ."
"he slips an arm around my waist , pulling me to him ."
"emerson lifts me into his lap , cradling me against his hard chest as our tongues glide and glance against each other ."
"the taste of him is more intoxicating than any champagne i 've ever tasted ."
"`` take me to the bed , '' i whisper , kissing down along his throat ."
"i feel emerson slip an arm under my knees and effortlessly pick me up ."
"he 's a solid foot taller than me , and probably about 75 pounds heavier , so i might as well be a feather in his arms-or so he makes me feel ."
"in a few quick strides , he 's carried me out of the bathroom and over to the queen sized bed ."
"just as i 've imagined it a thousand times , he lays me out across the bedspread , drinking in the sight of me with his blue eyes ."
"only this time , it 's better than what i 've imagined ."
"because this time , it 's real ."
"`` undress me , '' i tell him , `` i want you to . ''"
"emerson kneels before me on the bed , his gaze burning with lust ."
"`` that 's right , '' he murmurs , his voice low and hoarse , `` i love it when you tell me what you want . ''"
"he lifts the black cotton tee shirt up over my head , and shucks off his own flannel ."
"catching my wrists in his hands , he pins them up over my head and lowers his body on top of mine , kissing me from the neck to the space between my breasts ."
"he flicks open the clasp of my bra and closes his teeth around the edge of one cup , glancing up at me with a devilish wink ."
"i feel a deep throb of need between my legs as he tugs my bra away with his teeth , then pulls the white tank top up over his head and immediately lowers his full lips to my chest ."
"i suck in a huge breath as he wraps his lips around my taut nipple , his hands roving down my torso all the while ."
"the tip of his tongue flicks against the hard peak , sending a rush of sensation to the tips of my fingers and toes ."
"my head falls back against the bed as he sucks on my breasts , and i 'm so distracted that i almost do n't notice as he eases the skinny jeans down off my legs ."
"`` you wore them , '' he grins , sitting back on his heels to admire my choice in panties ."
"i look down at the black lace thong barely covering my most intimate flesh ."
"it 's the same pair i was wearing that night at the party , when we finally let each other in on how we really felt , if not out loud ."
"that night seems like eons ago , but it 's only been a matter of weeks ."
"look how much can change when you 're honest about what you really want ."
"`` i thought you 'd appreciate that , '' i whisper , letting my legs fall open before him ."
"`` appreciation does n't even come close , '' he growls , unbuckling his belt and tugging down his own jeans ."
"the rise in his black briefs ca n't be contained ."
"he 's hard as a rock for me , and absolutely huge ."
"emerson loops his fingers through the band of my thong and slowly , reverently , eases it down my legs ."
"i lay before him , utterly naked , the cool air playing against my slick sex ."
"with his eyes locked on me , emerson tugs down his briefs , letting me see him in all his glory ."
"for a moment , it 's all we can do to stare at each other ."
"emerson kneels over me , his cock standing at full attention for me ."
"i drink in the sight of it , thick and throbbing with want ."
"without thinking , i bring my hands to his hard length-i need both to grab hold of it ."
"emerson groans as i kneel opposite him , working my hands all along his cock ."
"taking my lead , he lays back on the bed as i continue to stroke him , feeling him get harder in my hands ."
"as his head hits the pillow , i ca n't wait any longer ."
"i bring my lips to the round , shapely tip of him and close my lips around it ."
"his eyes scrunch up in bliss as i take his cock into my mouth , running my tongue along his tender shaft ."
"i work my mouth along him , using both hands to keep a firm grasp ."
"i love the feel of him as he fills up my mouth , the taste of him as he pulses for me ."
"`` abby , '' he gasps , reaching for me , `` i need you ... i need ... '' `` tell me , '' i breathe , breaking away before running my tongue all around his bulging head ."
"`` tell me what you want . ''"
"in reply , i feel his hands close around my hips and tug me up toward him ."
"i let him guide me , not knowing where this is heading but not caring too much either ."
"with firm hands , he turns my body around so that i 'm facing away from him ."
"before i can ask what he wants me to do , he 's tugged my hips back toward his face , lying out beneath me ."
"i cry out in delighted surprise as he brings his mouth swiftly to my sex , licking along my wet slit from below ."
"my back arches with pleasure as the tip of his tongue finds my rock hard clit , and i groan as he wraps his lips around it ."
"his cock is standing tall , harder than ever and far too delicious-looking to let be ."
"as emerson flicks his tongue across my aching clit , i lean forward and take him into my mouth as voraciously as ever ."
"we work each other into a frenzy , giving and taking as much as we can possibly manage ."
"how can something feel so illicit and so natural all at the same time ?"
"i suck hard on emerson 's cock as i feel myself teetering on the edge of orgasm ."
"he must be able to feel it in me , because he takes out all the stops ."
"i feel him slide two strong fingers into me as he licks along the length of me ."
"his fingers pulse against that tender spot inside of me as the tip of his tongue flicks against my clit ."
"and just like that , i 'm a goner ."
"i come hard as he laps up my desire , the room spinning around me ."
"as the orgasm shudders through me , emerson rolls me onto my back ."
"i sprawl out beneath him , wide-eyed with blissful wonder ."
"wordlessly , he reaches into the pocket of his discarded jeans and pulls out a condom ."
"ripping open the package with his teeth , he can scarcely keep his eyes off of me ."
"he rolls the condom down his pulsating length , and it finally hits me : this is really happening ."
"his eyes are blazing as he lowers his taut body to mine ."
"wrapping my ankles around his tapered waist , i moan as i feel his swollen head pressing against my wet sex ."
"this is it ."
"at long last ."
"emerson locks his eyes on mine , and we might as well be the only two people on the planet ."
"he lingers there for just a moment , on the precipice of our knowing each other in an entirely new way ."
"my whole body is screaming to feel him drive into me , demolish and rebuild me with the force of his need ."
"i reach up and take his face in my hands ."
"`` i 'm all yours , '' i whisper , my gaze steady on his face ."
"`` take me . ''"
"something blazes behind his eyes as he brings his mouth to mine ."
"he bucks his hips , pressing himself into me ."
"a moan fills my throat as he parts my silky flesh with his staggering length ."
"i can feel him diving into the very core of me ."
"at last , he 's all the way in , and i can scarcely believe that he fits at all ."
"but he does ."
"and it feels fucking fantastic ."
"our bodies move together , limbs tangled , chests heaving ."
"he drives into me as i pull him in further , each of us trying to feel as much of the other as possible ."
"a low , thudding bliss is building inside of me once more , and i can feel him growing to fill me-he 's right on the edge ."
"he thrusts hard and deep , his face screwed up in a mask of ecstatic wonder ."
"i grab hold of his perfect , firm ass , pulling him in as far as i can as i tell him , `` let go . ''"
"both of our voices swell into a huge groan as he pummels into me once more and comes , hard ."
"i clutch onto him as i feel him spasm and gush inside of me , gaze up at him as his mouth falls open into a perfect `` o '' ."
"it feels like a year goes by before we even begin to come back down to earth again ."
"emerson lowers himself down next to me on the bed , pulling me to his chest ."
"i rest my cheek on his hot skin , listening to the wild beating of his heart ."
"i ca n't formulate a single word to tell him what this has meant to me , that it was so much better than i ever could have hoped , and that i do n't know how i 'll stand to never have him again ."
"but the thing is , i do n't need to tell him ."
"just laying here beside me , it 's clear that he already knows ."
"chapter nine i arrange my blonde hair into a hasty up-do , trying to keep from crying ."
"i 've been on the verge of tears since about five minutes after i woke up this morning-when i remembered what today is ."
"our parents ' wedding day ."
"the day that emerson and i become step siblings ."
"i 've changed into my maid of honor dress , a lavender sheath , and tried my best to apply fancy makeup ."
"we have to head right to the church this morning , just like we promised , and we 're already getting kind of a late start ."
"i lock eyes with myself in the mirror , see the tears shining there ."
"`` stop it , '' i whisper , `` you ca n't cry now ."
"you always knew this was coming . ''"
"but even though emerson and i had our one night together knowing full well that it would be our last , it does n't make it hurt any less ."
"stepping out into the hotel bedroom , i feel my heart clench painfully as emerson turns to face me across the space ."
"he 's wearing a simple gray suit , but it might as well be a tux for how good it looks on him ."
"his hair is pushed away from his face , though the signature stubble i love so much is still in place ."
"his blue eyes are shining with remorse for what 's about to happen and elation at what passed between us last night ."
"`` you look beautiful , '' he says , his voice ragged with conflicting emotion ."
"`` thank you , '' i say softly , `` you look amazing , too . ''"
"`` here , '' he says , moving to the motel mini-fridge ."
"he opens it up and takes out a corsage in its little container ."
"it 's a small sprig of lilac tied with an ivory ribbon ."
"`` what is this , prom ? ''"
"i laugh tearfully , as emerson eases the band of the corsage up over my wrist ."
"`` just as miserable as prom , probably , '' he grins wistfully , lacing my fingers through his ."
"`` well , do n't go overboard , '' i joke , stepping toward him ."
"without preamble , he pulls me into a tight embrace , pressing his lips ardently to mine ."
"i take his face in my hands , kissing him hard ."
"we both know that this is the last kiss we 'll ever share ."
"it 's closed-lipped , almost sacred ."
"and i 'll never forget it ."
"`` i do n't know how just yet , '' emerson murmurs , running his hands down my arms , `` but it 's going to be ok , abby ."
"we 're gon na make it through this . ''"
"`` i 'll have to take your word for it , '' i say , shaking my head , `` because right now , i ca n't see how i 'm ever going to feel alright again . ''"
"`` at least we 'll still be in each others ' lives , '' emerson says , searching for a silver lining ."
"`` even if it wo n't be ... how we 'd prefer . ''"
"`` i hope you know that i 'll never stop wondering what might have happened between us , '' i whisper , `` you know ."
"if only ... '' `` i know , '' he says softly , kissing me on the forehead , `` me too , abby . ''"
"knowing that we wo n't be able to utter another word without breaking into tears , we silently gather our things ."
"we stand in the threshold together , looking back at the motel room ."
"i 'm not sure that i 'll ever be as happy again as i have been here ."
"as emerson closes the door behind us , it feels like something is being entombed here-some part of me that is lost forever ."
"i sink into the passenger seat of the chevy and stare out the window as we set off on the long drive back to our home town ."
"hopefully , by the time we get there , i 'll find it in my heart to fake a smile or two for my father 's wedding day ."
"things are already well underway at our home by the time we pull up ."
"my dad is waiting on the front steps , looking tense ."
"i recognize my grandparents ' car , and another that must belong to the justice of the peace , in the driveway ."
"`` there you two are ! ''"
"my dad cries , beckoning us forward ."
"`` come in , come in ."
"frank and gillian are waiting to see you . ''"
"that 's why he looks tense ."
"he and my grandparents are already sure to be butting heads ."
"i give dad a quick kiss on the cheek as i pass ."
"`` you look nice , daddy , '' i tell him , trying to be chipper ."
"`` you too , sweetie , '' he replies distractedly ."
"a pang of sadness twists my core at our clipped address ."
"he 's taking so much away from me today , more than he could ever know , and for what ?"
"a shadow of the relationship we used to have ?"
"i force myself not to think of it as i hurry toward the kitchen with emerson in tow ."
"stepping inside , i spot my grandparents huddled over the counter ."
"they 're dressed to the nines-grandpa frank in an italian wool suit , grandma jillian in her favorite fur stole ."
"they 've always looked to me like first class passengers on some old-timey luxury cruise line ."
"the only things unappealing about their appearances today are the twin scowls they try to cover up as i approach ."
"`` abigail , '' grandma jillian smiles , air-kissing both of my cheeks ."
"a soft wash of her signature chanel perfume brings back a million memories of tense family gatherings and etiquette lessons ."
"i love my grandparents , but there 's definitely a lot of pressure that goes along with trying to meet their expectations ."
"`` you look gorgeous , dear , '' grandpa frank says , giving me a swift kiss on the hand ."
"they 're a beautiful couple , and look much younger than they actually are ."
"grandma 's perfect crown of platinum blonde curls , grandpa 's swoosh of silver hair , and their bright white smiles make them look like an advertisement for the swankiest retirement community around ."
"`` grandpa , grandma , this is emerson-deb 's son , '' i say , glancing emerson 's way ."
"he 's got both hands shoved into his pockets , and his mouth is a hard , solemn line ."
"`` ah , '' grandpa says , without warmth ."
"`` well ."
"hello , emerson . ''"
"`` hey , '' emerson nods ."
"`` i 'm jillian ."
"it 's nice to meet you , '' grandma says , offering her hand for emerson to kiss ."
"i watch , trying not to laugh , as he takes her hand and gives it a good solid shake instead ."
"`` and here 's the man of the hour himself , '' grandpa says , looking up as dad walks into the kitchen with the justice of the peace-a balding man with a cheerful red face ."
"`` are we starting soon ? ''"
"grandma asks , `` the girls are playing bridge at three and i 'd really prefer not to be late . ''"
"`` we 'll start as soon as deb is ready , '' dad replies curtly ."
"`` i 'm sure she 's just putting the finishing touches on- '' `` i 'm all set ! ''"
"deb sings out from the stairs ."
"we all turn to watch her grand entrance as she clatters down the last few steps and struts her stuff our way ."
"i can practically hear my grandparents ' jaws crack against the tile floor as deb meets us in the kitchen ."
"her rhinestone-encrusted heels must be five inches high , and fully visible beneath the micro minidress that 's serving as her wedding gown ."
"a huge , flowing bustle trails along behind her , and her already voluminous blonde curls are stacked a mile high in a hairdo that would make the most seasoned pageant girl raise an eyebrow ."
"her makeup looks painted on , most especially her hot pink lipstick ."
"she looks positively ecstatic ... but not exactly the picture of the blushing bride we all had in mind-especially my grandparents ."
"`` i ca n't believe our wedding day is finally here ! ''"
"she squeals , leaping into my dad 's arms ."
"she kisses every inch of his face , leaving little smudges of pink all over ."
"i 'm a little concerned that my grandparents have literally turned to stone beside me ."
"dad manages to pry deb off of him long enough to turn her frank and jillian 's way ."
"`` deb , '' my dad says through a forced smile , `` these are my parents . ''"
"`` oh ."
"my ."
"god , '' deb breathes , splaying her hands out over her heart ."
"`` you are just about the fanciest people i 've ever seen in my entire life . ''"
"`` yes ."
"well , '' grandma says , unable to form any additional words ."
"`` that is ... some dress you 've got there , '' grandpa attempts ."
"`` dad , '' my own father hisses warningly ."
"`` oh , you like it ? ''"
"deb chirps , giving us all a little spin ."
"`` i got in at forty percent off ."
"still a rip off , if you ask me , but heck-it 's a special occasion , right ?"
"and it 's not like bob here is hurting for money . ''"
"my grandparents ' eyebrows shoot up , disappearing into their hair lines ."
"deb falters , looking back and forth between them ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"was that tacky ? ''"
"`` ah , so you are familiar with the word , then , '' grandma says coolly ."
"i glance at emerson , embarrassed by my grandparents ' icy behavior ."
"but his face is totally unreadable-i have no idea if he 's even listening ."
"deb , not knowing what to do with my grandparents ' disdain , turns to emerson and me with a tight grin ."
"`` now you two look so darling , '' she sighs tearfully ."
"`` our big happy family , at last . ''"
"i catch grandpa rolling his eyes as the justice of the peace claps his hands ."
"`` so ! ''"
"the jolly official says , `` shall we head to the backyard for the ceremony ? ''"
"deb grabs hold of my dad 's hand and yanks him out the back door ."
"they 've set up a flimsy white altar in front of the pool , which is filled with floating flower blossoms ."
"emerson walks out ahead of me , keeping his eyes straight ahead , and my grandparents bring up the rear ."
"deb 's heels sink into the grass as she teeters toward the altar on my dad 's arm ."
"emerson stands beside her , and i take my place next to dad ."
"the justice of the peace stands between them , and my grandparents move front and center , all but wrinkling their noses ."
"the wedding of the century , indeed ."
"i ca n't make myself focus as the justice of the peace starts rattling through the motions ."
"emerson and i stand facing each other , looking over our parents ' shoulders ."
"i 've never seen him look so miserable ."
"more than being upset for my own heartbreak , i hate our parents in this moment for causing emerson so much pain ."
"he 's been through so much already , and now this fiasco ?"
"it 's more than anyone should have to bear ."
"`` ok then , '' the justice of the peace goes on ."
"`` if we could have the rings ... '' emerson thrusts them into my dad 's hand ."
"our parents slip the gaudy trinkets onto each other 's hands , grinning like two teenagers ."
"the words of their vows and even their `` i do 's '' fade into white noise as emerson finally lifts his eyes to mine ."
"we stare at each other , laid bare in this anguished moment ."
"our gazes say what we never got a chance to : `` i care about you more than anything in this world ."
"i 'm so sorry you 're in pain . ''"
"and as our parents share their first kiss as man and wife , i try my best to tell emerson one more thing with my silent , pleading eyes : `` i love you . ''"
"and as i look on , my heart breaking , i could swear his blue eyes tell me , `` i love you too . ''"
"chapter ten by midnight the house is all but silent once more ."
"leftover food and cake clutters every surface of the kitchen , crushed petals stain the floors , and the plastic flowers on the rickety altar out back have started dropping off , one by one ."
"dad and deb have flown the coop , off on the first leg of their honeymoon in new york city ."
"grandma and grandpa beat a quick retreat after a bite of cake and three brandies each ."
"the house , my home , feels like a crypt now ."
"but i suppose that 's appropriate-i 'm certainly in mourning ."
"emerson and i , still dressed up in our wedding day best , sit side-by-side at the kitchen island ."
"there 's an open bottle of vodka and a gigantic round of wedding cake sitting between us , and we 're helping ourselves to an abundance of both ."
"neither of us can think of anything productive to say , but are loathe to be alone tonight ."
"we sit there in silence , being careful not to brush elbows or even look at each other for too long ."
"as of this afternoon , when the ink dried on our parents ' marriage license , our relationship can only be strictly platonic ."
"i have n't been this miserable since my mom passed away ."
"this feeling of running up against devastating injustice is something i 'm all too familiar with by now ."
"without a word , emerson refills our glasses of straight vodka ."
"he snatches up his glass and downs his booze in one swallow ."
"tearing off his necktie , he staggers to his feet ."
"i stare at him as he turns to leave ."
"`` where are you going ? ''"
"i murmur , the room spinning as i stand up after him ."
"`` bed , '' he growls , not looking at me ."
"`` that 's it ? ''"
"i ask around the sudden lump in my throat , `` it 's just gon na be one word answers from now on ? ''"
"`` what did you expect ? ''"
"he replies , keeping his back to me ."
"`` i expected you to ... to be ... '' `` your friend ? ''"
"he scoffs , shoving a hand through his hair ."
"`` that was never going to happen , abby ."
"you know that as well as i do . ''"
"`` we have to at least try , '' i say softly , reaching out to touch him ."
"at the slightest brush of my fingers , he rips his arm away from me , spinning around with fire in his eyes ."
"`` i ca n't do that , '' he rages ."
"`` no fucking way can i just be your friend . ''"
"`` do n't yell at me , '' i say , steadying myself against the counter ."
"`` you 're drunk ."
"you 're upset ."
"this is n't you talking- '' `` as if you know the first thing about me , '' he fires back , shaking his head ."
"`` one fuck , and you think we 're soul mates or something ? ''"
"`` stop it , '' i tell him fiercely ."
"`` i know what you 're doing ."
"you 're trying to hurt me ."
"trying to drive me away so that you do n't have to deal with what 's happening ."
"well too fucking bad ."
"i 'm not going anywhere , emerson ."
"you ca n't scare me away . ''"
"`` no ? ''"
"he demands , stepping toward me ."
"he plants one hand on either side of me , caging me in against the counter ."
"`` you really think so ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"i do , '' i whisper , keeping my hazel eyes trained on his face ."
"our lips are mere inches from each other , our bodies all but pressed together ."
"the sudden proximity of him sets me to trembling ."
"i ca n't be strong enough for both of us ."
"i need his help ."
"`` please , emerson , '' i say , blinking away the tears that blur my vision ."
"`` could you just ... hold me ?"
"just for a second . ''"
"he stares at me , his blue eyes frozen over ."
"but as the first tear rolls down my cheek , i watch the ice crack ."
"the fight goes out of him , making way for the despair he 's been trying to cover up with aggression ."
"`` come here , '' he murmurs , opening his arms to me ."
"i rush to him , throwing myself into his embrace ."
"he enfolds me in a fierce hug as the tears come hard and fast ."
"he kisses the top of my head , pulling me tightly against him ."
"`` you ca n't disappear on me like that , '' i cry , burying my face in the front of his suit ."
"`` i ca n't get through this without you , emerson . ''"
"`` i know ."
"i 'm sorry , '' he says , his voice rasping ."
"`` this is just ... it 's so hard , abby ."
"what am i supposed to do without you in my life ?"
"the way i want you to be , i mean ... ? ''"
"`` i 'll let you know when i figure it out , '' i say miserably ."
"we hold each other , each unwilling to be the first to break the embrace ."
"as the sky begins to lighten , we finally trudge upstairs , entirely spent ."
"i walk ahead of emerson , my body tired and aching ."
"the prospect of sleeping alone tonight is too much to bear ."
"it 's hard to believe that it was just last night that i fell asleep next to emerson , my cheek resting against his bare chest ."
"it feels like years ago that our bodies met , collided , moved as one ."
"it was , without question , the best night of my life ."
"and would you look at that ?"
"it 's being followed up by the worst ."
"emerson and i reach the top of the stairs and pause , each glancing at our bedrooms at opposite ends of the hall ."
"turning away from each other now seems like the final step , the last nail in the coffin sealing up our barely-formed relationship ."
"after the wrenching , brutal escapade that was our parents ' wedding ceremony this afternoon , i do n't know if i can take it ."
"`` you know , '' i say softly ."
"`` today was sort of like a nightmare . ''"
"`` that 's for fucking sure , '' he murmurs , glancing my way ."
"`` and after a nightmare ... is n't is usually ok for a little sister to crawl into her big brother 's bed ? ''"
"i ask tearfully ."
"a slow , sad smile spreads across his gorgeous face ."
"`` nice justification , weirdo , '' he teases softly , offering me his hand ."
"i lace my fingers through his ."
"silently , we walk down the hallway toward his room ."
"we do n't even have the energy to change out of our clothes ."
"with vodka-clouded heads and heavy hearts , we collapse onto his bed ."
"emerson wraps his arms around me , pulling me close ."
"there 's no question of things going any further between us now , but this simple comforting embrace is a balm for my battered soul ."
"in an instant we 've fallen into a deep , mercifully dreamless sleep ."
"i 'm jerked out of slumber the next morning by the sound of screaming voices ."
"prying open my eyes , i notice two things straightaway ."
"first , i am massively hungover , having eaten next to nothing yesterday and had half a bottle of vodka to drink ."
"second , i 'm still lying beside the sleeping emerson , despite the fact that it 's monday morning and school is set to start in a mere twenty minutes ."
"but before i can worry about my attendance record , the crash of shattering glass catches my ear from downstairs ."
"two hysterical voices rage at each other as other objects go hurtling around the ground floor ."
"emerson 's eyes fly open at the sound of the unfolding chaos , and we turn to look at each other , at a loss ."
"i recognize dad and deb 's voices at once , but i 've never heard either of them so irate ."
"`` funneling my money to that lowlife junkie ! ''"
"my dad bellows , as something heavy topples over ."
"`` your money ? ''"
"deb cries shrilly , `` you mean your parents ' money , do n't you ? ''"
"`` do n't start with that class warfare bullshit- '' `` i do n't have to !"
"they already did ."
"you think i did n't see how they looked at me yesterday ?"
"you 'd think i was wearing a g-string and pasties- '' `` well , you were n't wearing much else ! ''"
"something else smashes into a thousand pieces , and i grab for emerson 's hand , panicked ."
"`` do n't try and change the goddamn subject , '' my dad snarls ."
"`` you 've been stealing from me for your scumbag ex and your loser drug baby ! ''"
"emerson 's fingers tighten around mine , his body rippling with fury ."
"`` my son is not a loser ! ''"
"deb weeps , charging up the stairs , `` and he 's not staying here in this house for another second ! ''"
"the entire world grinds to a standstill as emerson 's bedroom door flies open ."
"deb appears in the doorway , thick rivulets of mascara coursing down her cheeks ."
"emerson and i stare up at her , entwined in his bed , as my red-faced father appears on the top of the stairs ."
"the four of us are frozen in a surreal tableau , and for a second i hope against all hope that this is just another terrible dream but in the next moment , reality floods back in ."
"`` what the fuck is this ? ''"
"deb shrieks , falling back against the door in horror ."
"`` we were just-we- '' i stammer , looking helplessly at emerson ."
"`` get away of my daughter , you piece of shit ! ''"
"my dad roars , charging into the bedroom ."
"he grabs me by my arm and wrenches me brutally out of bed ."
"`` dad , you 're hurting me , '' i gasp , trying and failing to break free from his grip ."
"`` do n't touch her , '' emerson shouts , leaping to his feet and shoving my father away from me ."
"he shields me from my dad 's wrath with his solid body , but my dad lunges for me all the same ."
"the smell of booze seeping off of him turns my stomach ."
"`` are you drunk ? ''"
"i gasp , staring at my father ."
"but his swaying stance and bloodshot eyes answer my question ."
"i whip around toward deb and see that she , too , is standing unsteadily , unable to focus on a single point for more than a second ."
"it 's not even nine o'clock , and they 're both wasted ."
"`` jesus christ , mom , '' emerson growls , staring at his mother in disbelief ."
"`` again ? ''"
"`` do n't you judge me , '' deb snaps , shaking her mess of wilted curls ."
"`` if you knew the sort of night i had ... this man is a monster . ''"
"`` i 'm a monster ? ''"
"my dad returns , whirling unsteadily toward her , `` you 're the lying , thieving whore- '' `` emerson , no ! ''"
"i screech , as he cocks back his fist and slams it against my father 's jaw ."
"dad goes reeling through the open doorway , and emerson leaps after him ."
"deb collapses into a teary puddle as emerson and dad brawl on the landing ."
"i rush toward them , ready to throw myself into the fray ."
"but a loose punch from dad hits me square in the stomach , knocking me back against the wall ."
"emerson snaps his face toward me , too worried about my wellbeing to focus on my dad ."
"but in the moment of his distraction , dad strikes back-sending a cracking blow railing against emerson 's high cheekbone ."
"a sickening crunch rings out through the house ."
"a scream rips out of my throat as emerson stumbles against the second story railing ."
"my dad tries to grab him by the front of his suit , but misses ."
"in a burst of rage , emerson grabs hold of my dad and slams him against the bannister , ready to throw him off the landing ."
"`` stop it !"
"emerson , stop ! ''"
"i scream ."
"finally , i seem to get through to him ."
"with gritted teeth , he lowers my dad away from the edge , tossing him roughly onto the floor ."
"he raises his blue eyes to mine , and my heart shatters as i see the furious tears streaming down his face ."
"stepping over my dad 's drunken , prostrate form , emerson marches into his room and snatches his mother up by the arm ."
"she can barely stand , beside herself with wasted emotion ."
"emerson swings her arm over his shoulders and all but drags her away , carrying her dead weight down the stairs ."
"`` wait , '' i call out , my voice a strangled cry , `` emerson , where are you going ? ''"
"but he does n't answer me ."
"he simply makes his way to the front door ."
"i pull myself off the ground and race after him , grabbing for the back of his suit ."
"`` emerson , '' i plead , clutching the bannister as i reach the final stair ."
"`` stop ."
"you ca n't go ."
"not now . ''"
"he pauses with his hand on the doorknob ."
"turning back to look at me , his eyes are full of hardened resolve ."
"he 's shut his heart out of the equation , i know ."
"and try as i might , there will be no reaching him now ."
"`` goodbye abby , '' he whispers , and wrenches the door open ."
"he guides his mother across the threshold and out to his chevy ."
"it is n't until i hear the engine start that i sink down onto the stairs , hollow and cold ."
"he 's gone ."
"and this time , i know he wo n't be coming back for me ."
"i glance around the house , at all the artifacts of my childhood that were destroyed in dad and deb 's wake ."
"but of course , it 's not the material things i grieve for , now ."
"it 's my entire life as i 've known it ."
"the future that will never come to pass ."
"i sit there at the foot of the steps for hours , listening to my dad 's anguished groans from the landing ."
"at some point , he manages to stand and pull himself into the master bedroom , slamming the door behind him ."
"he wo n't come down to check on me ."
"not in the state he 's in ."
"but who am i kidding ?"
"even at his best , dad could n't be bothered to give a shit about me ."
"numbness creeps through my body as i sit stock still , unable to process what 's happened to me ."
"to emerson ."
"to our splintered family ."
"nothing that 's happened this morning makes any sense ."
"what happened that set our parents to drinking like that ?"
"what was my dad saying about deb stealing from him ?"
"and what about my grandparents ' interference with dad and deb 's brand new marriage ?"
"chapter eleven it 's noon before i 'm torn out of my shocked reverie by the sound of a car door slamming ."
"my pulse picks up as i pull myself to my feet ."
"has emerson come back home again after all ?"
"is he here to help me make sense of all this chaos ?"
"the front door clatters open , and a familiar face appears-but it is n't his ."
"`` abby , '' riley breathes , rushing to me ."
"`` abby , what the hell is going on ? ''"
"`` riley ? ''"
"i breathe , unable to focus , `` riley , what- ? ''"
"`` are you ok ? ''"
"she whispers , her voice tearful ."
"she takes me in her arms , brushing the hair out of my eyes ."
"`` are you hurt ? ''"
"`` no , i 'm ... riley , what are you doing here ? ''"
"i ask ."
"`` how did you know to come ? ''"
"her already dark eyes cloud over as she wraps her arms around me ."
"she 's bracing me for something ."
"bad news ."
"but what ?"
"`` you did n't show up at school , '' she says softly , `` but emerson did ."
"he stormed in just as people were switching classes ."
"abby ... he ... ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"i whisper , looking at her with mounting dread ."
"`` what did he do ? ''"
"she rests her hands on my shoulders , take a deep breath , and goes on ."
"`` he started screaming for tucker , '' she tells me , `` and when he finally found him , he ... abby , he just beat the shit out of him ."
"it was brutal ."
"some teachers eventually pulled him off and threatened to call the cops ."
"emerson 's been expelled , abby ."
"he ran back out of the school and drove off ."
"i could n't find you anywhere , so i thought ... i was so scared ... '' i stare at my best friend , uncomprehending ."
"my heart can take on no more anguish ."
"there is n't any room left ."
"i sink into a state of catatonic silence as riley gathers a change of clothes for me and leads me out of my house ."
"it 's the last time i ever step foot in that place i once called home ."
"over the course of the tumultuous next few months , the entire sordid saga comes out into the open ."
"on the morning after their wedding , dad and deb were about to head off to europe for a couple weeks for the second leg of their honeymoon ."
"dad visited the bank to get some travelers ' checks , but found that his accounts had been frozen because of some suspicious activity ."
"he and deb had already consolidated accounts when they moved in together , but dad has never been good about keeping track of his money ."
"only when it was pointed out to him by the bank did he notice the dozen or so transactions in deb 's name ."
"she 'd been withdrawing money , keeping some in a separate account , presumably for her and emerson ."
"the rest she 'd been wiring to her ex-husband , emerson 's father , still serving time in connecticut state prison ."
"devastated by deb 's betrayal , dad struck out to hurt her in the worst way he could think of ."
"he stocked up on booze , headed back to the hotel , and baited her into going on a bender with him ."
"she allowed it to happen , of course , but dad was the instigator ."
"only when they were both wasted in their hotel room in the wee hours of the morning did he turn on her ."
"he demanded an explanation , but the only one she had to give was that she 'd been using him ."
"she noticed him at aa-saw his nice clothes , fancy car , and sad eyes-and knew he 'd go for her ."
"deb insisted that she developed real feelings for him later , and that she could n't just leave her ex-husband to rot in prison , but it was obviously too late ."
"emerson 's expulsion from our high school was immediate and ironclad , after what he did to tucker ."
"i have no idea what possessed him , in that moment , to target my assailant from years ago ."
"maybe he wanted to hurt someone who had hurt me , and given that he could n't throttle my dad the way he wanted to , went after tucker instead ."
"i 'll never know what his motivation was ."
"all i know is that tucker ended up with two broken ribs and had to wear a neck brace to prom ."
"or so i 'm told ."
"it 's not like i had any reason to go ."
"the bender dad started as payback for deb did n't end the day after his wedding ."
"or the week after ."
"or the month after ."
"he descended into an alcoholic depression that far exceeded the one he 'd fallen into after mom 's death ."
"i could n't go back to his house-i did n't feel safe there ."
"i stayed with riley for a few days before my grandparents arrived on the scene ."
"they came up from florida and took me in to one of their nearby summer homes for the duration of the school year ."
"dad did n't even put up a fight when they took me away ."
"but he did tell them all about finding me in bed with emerson the morning after the wedding ."
"and even though nothing had happened between us that night , my grandparents looked at me a little differently from then on ."
"in no time at all , the marriage was annulled ."
"no one will tell me where emerson and deb have gone , and i do n't even know where to start looking ."
"but to be honest , i 'm too brokenhearted to search very hard ."
"if emerson wanted me to know where he was , i 'd know ."
"as painful as it is , i have to accept the fact that he does n't want to be a part of my life ."
"even once our parents ' marriage is dissolved , there 's no trace of him ."
"so be it ."
"i dive into the last semester of my schoolwork , and end up graduating in the top ten percent of my class ."
"riley and i both decide to continue our studies in the fall at the new school in new york city ."
"my grandparents agree to pay for the portion of my tuition that is n't covered by scholarships , and even let riley and me stay in the apartment they own in new york as an investment property ."
"i spend the summer by my best friend 's side , slowly but surely coming to terms with everything that 's happened ."
"i tell myself every day that come fall , i 'll be able to leave the whole ugly mess of my childhood behind me ."
"and hopefully , my memories of emerson sawyer along with it ."
"chapter twelve new york city eight years later `` which do you like better ? ''"
"i ask anxiously , holding two dresses up before me , `` the black , or the navy ? ''"
"riley rolls her eyes at my outfit choices ."
"`` i 'd like it if you ever bought anything that you could n't also wear to a funeral , '' she replies ."
"`` would you be serious ? ''"
"i plead , `` my interview is in two hours , and god knows it 's probably going to take me an hour to get there , and i might have to stop and find a starbucks to pee in first because i ca n't ask to pee during an interview- '' `` abby , '' riley says , taking my just-scrubbed face in her hands ."
"`` relax ."
"you 're going to nail this ."
"you are perfect for this job . ''"
"i stare back at her , trying to have as much confidence in me as she does ."
"in the past six years , riley has transformed from a dissatisfied party girl to a successful pr powerhouse ."
"she 's traded in the cheap vodka for top-shelf martinis and the house parties for bottle service and chef 's tables at all the best places in the city ."
"we 've been living together since we were eighteen , and are closer than ever because of it ."
"but being close means being blunt , and she does n't hold back with me now ."
"`` if you do n't take a breath and cool it , you 're going to be kicking yourself all the way home , '' she says , marching me over to her closet ."
"she rummages through her colorful wardrobe and hands me an emerald green blouse and yellow pencil skirt ."
"`` here ."
"put these on . ''"
"`` they 're very ... bright , '' i say ."
"`` just like you ! ''"
"she grins ."
"`` you 're interviewing at a creative agency , not a morgue , for christ 's sake ."
"a little color will be good , trust me . ''"
"`` well ."
"thanks , '' i sigh , taking the pieces and heading back into my room to change ."
"`` i wo n't fill them out as well as you , but ... '' `` if you think i 'm going to cry you a river for having stayed the same size since you were seventeen years old , you 've got another thing coming to you , '' riley tells me ."
"`` speaking of getting older , though , what do you want to do for your birthday this weekend ? ''"
"`` nothing , '' i tell her through the crack in my bedroom door ."
"`` that 's not an option , '' she replies , as i slip into the clothes she 's leant me ."
"`` you know i hate my birthday , '' i call back , piling my hair into a quick , wispy up do ."
"it 's still blonde , if a bit of a darker shade than when i was a kid ."
"`` all i ever want is to have a quiet night at home . ''"
"`` and you know that i 've never taken that for an answer , '' riley reminds me , rustling around the kitchen ."
"`` my grandparents are already taking me out to some swanky restaurant , '' i tell her , `` i owe it to them for letting us stay in this place . ''"
"`` they 're not using it , '' riley reminds me ."
"`` still , '' i insist , `` living rent free is not exactly something to be taken for granted . ''"
"`` not with what i spend on booze it is n't , '' riley agrees ."
"`` at least let me take you out for a drink after your fancy dinner , ok ?"
"you can give me all the juicy family gossip . ''"
"i cringe to think of what that gossip might be as i swipe some light makeup onto my face ."
"every time i see my grandparents , they spend at least an hour moaning about how badly my dad is doing ."
"he 's been in and out of rehab since breaking up with `` that woman , '' as my grandparents like to refer deb ."
"after the brawl that ensued the morning after his wedding , i no longer make an effort to include him in my life ."
"some things ca n't be forgiven , and the way he treated me that day is one of them ."
"`` i 'll give you one birthday drink , '' i tell riley , grabbing my purse , `` but no surprise karaoke this year , ok ?"
"or surprise strippers ."
"or ... you know what ?"
"just no surprises period . ''"
"`` cross my heart , '' riley smiles ."
"`` sure , '' i say , stepping back out into the living room ."
"`` so ?"
"how do i look ? ''"
"`` fabulous , as ever , '' she says , giving me a quick once-over ."
"`` they 're going to love you . ''"
"`` i hope so , '' i sigh , `` bastian does such amazing work ."
"they 're one of the best new creative agencies out there ."
"it would be a dream to work for them . ''"
"`` so , tell them that ! ''"
"riley insists , giving me a quick hug and a pat on the ass ."
"`` go get 'em tiger . ''"
"i take a deep breath and march out of our upper west side apartment ."
"it 's been a few months since i finished my masters program in graphic design ."
"i 've been able to freelance for a few different companies , and have built up my portfolio by doing so ."
"i never pictured myself having such a tech-based job , always sort of assumed i 'd stick with visual art exclusively ."
"but graphic design lets me be just as creative as drawing does , and employ my mind in other ways , too ."
"if i get this job as bastian , i 'll be designing and helping come up with marketing strategies for different companies and brands ."
"it would be something new every day , the perfect , totally consuming job ."
"just what i 'm looking for ."
"do n't get me wrong , i have other interests and hobbies , outside of work ."
"i 'm an avid runner , adore going out to restaurants , read like a maniac , and try and volunteer around the city ."
"i just loathe downtime more than anything in the world ."
"downtime means thinking time , reminiscing time , and i want as little of that in my life as possible ."
"without fail , my thoughts always turn to the past if they 're not rooted in the present ."
"and that 's never a pleasant experience for me ."
"i take the subway down to the lower east side , a neighborhood chock full of galleries , cool shops , and excellent cafes-not the mention some kickass bars ."
"the bastian offices are housed in a building that used to be a factory , once upon a time ."
"these days , it has the industrial feel that 's so popular in the city while simultaneously being super high tech ."
"the best of both worlds ."
"i stop before the front door the office , taking a moment to check my reflection in the glass ."
"riley was right to suggest this top-it brings out the green in my hazel eyes nicely ."
"as i ring the buzzer , a strange feeling passes through me ."
"it 's almost like deja vu , the feeling that this moment is significant , somehow ."
"clandestine ."
"maybe i 'm just anticipating the interview going well ?"
"whatever the case , there 's no more time to ponder ."
"the door opens before me , and i step quickly into an old fashioned elevator ."
"the elevator doors part before me , and i step out into the high-ceilinged office space ."
"a large communal desk stands at the center of the room , surrounded by a dozen hip twenty-somethings ."
"the walls are covered in white board , so that people can jot down ideas whenever and wherever they occur ."
"my jaw falls open a little as i see a fully stocked bar standing in one corner of the main room ."
"the people running this place were n't kidding when they described it as `` off beat '' ."
"i like it ."
"i 'm supposed to be meeting with the founding partner and ceo of the agency , owen cooper ."
"but glancing around the spacious room , i do n't see a reception desk anywhere ."
"silly me ."
"as if a place this cool would ever have something as square as a front desk ."
"`` are you abby ? ''"
"asks one of the people at the communal desk , plucking out an earbud as the rest of the group types on ."
"`` yeah , that 's me , '' i smile , hoping my nervousness does n't show ."
"`` cooper is waiting for you in his office , '' she says , nodding toward a glass door off the main room ."
"calling the boss by his last name , huh ?"
"how unconventional ."
"another check in the plus column for this place ."
"i thank her and make my way toward the door ."
"before i can raise my hand to rap against the frosted glass pane , it swings open before me ."
"standing there is a man i recognize from the bastian website as owen cooper himself ."
"he 's super young for a ceo , in his late 30 's or so ."
"he 's dressed in jeans , a sweater , and a friendly smile ."
"`` abby ! ''"
"he says , as if we were old friends ."
"i guess being able to check out interviewees ' social media profiles makes everyone fast friends these days ."
"`` come on in ."
"coffee ? ''"
"`` sure , '' i reply , `` it 's nice to meet you mr.- '' `` just 'cooper ' is fine , '' he cuts me off , pulling a shot from a fancy espresso machine sitting on a table against the wall ."
"`` so , thanks for coming in ."
"even if this is a bit of a formality . ''"
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"i ask , happily accepting the rich cup of espresso ."
"`` your portfolio is excellent , '' he tells me , sitting down at his desk ."
"`` top notch ."
"i knew i wanted to hire you from the second i saw your work ."
"sorry ... did i forget to mention that in my last email to you ? ''"
"`` that you did , '' i say , sinking into a chair opposite him in mild disbelief ."
"`` are you saying ... i already have the job ? ''"
"`` you do if you want it ! ''"
"he smiles , `` you 'll have to forgive my absent-mindedness ."
"my brain is always hurrying onto the next task , so i sometimes skip over what 's right in front of me ."
"anyhow , yes !"
"the job is yours for the taking . ''"
"`` well , i absolutely want to take it , '' i grin , `` thanks mr ... er , cooper . ''"
"`` yeah ! ''"
"he says , clinking his coffee cup to mine ."
"`` and you 're in luck , too ."
"one of our managing editors from the european office is going to be lending me a hand here in new york for a while ."
"he 's much less of a scatterbrain than i am , so he 's going to be the one showing you the ropes ."
"i ca n't remember if i told him that ... '' `` that sounds great , '' i reply , sipping the fine espresso as i try to play it cool ."
"i ca n't believe i stressed out all week for an interview that was actually a job offer !"
"i guess with the fast-paced aspect of the tech world , hiring practices are a little quicker at places like this ."
"`` so , what else can i tell you ... '' mr. cooper continues , propping his sneakered feet up on his desk ."
"`` salary is 60k ."
"full benefits ."
"three weeks vacation ... '' i stare at him , practically salivating ."
"i try to never think that something is too good to be true , as a rule ."
"but this whole situation is testing me ."
"`` well , what do you say ? ''"
"he presses jovially , `` are you interested in the job , abby ? ''"
"`` i 'm ... very interested ."
"absolutely , '' i grin , `` this is my dream job , mr ... cooper ."
"i ca n't tell you how i excited i am- '' `` yes , yes ."
"very good , '' cooper says , standing abruptly ."
"`` well , like i said , our brilliant managing editor is back from europe this afternoon , and he 's going to be helping you get settled here at bastian ."
"you 'll trail him to meetings , sit in on brainstorming sessions , all that good stuff ."
"but for today , just go home and relax ."
"take the friday to yourself ."
"this is a fast-paced company , abby ."
"you 're going to need all your stores of youthful energy come monday . ''"
"`` sounds great to me , '' i say , standing as cooper opens the door for me ."
"we walk back out onto the main floor together , but i might as well be walking on a cloud ."
"this whole week , i 've been stressing out about an interview that was actually an offer !"
"what a screwy industry this is ."
"i think i 'm going to love it ."
"the other employees look up with interest as cooper leads me to the elevators ."
"it 'll be so nice to work with people my age at a company on the cutting edge of creative innovation ."
"and i did n't even have to get grilled to score my place here !"
"this day could not get any better ."
"though of course , that just means it could get much , much worse ."
"`` see you next week ! ''"
"cooper says , as the elevator dings to a stop at our floor ."
"`` thanks again for giving me this job , '' i tell him , giving his hand a quick shake ."
"`` i promise you , you wo n't be sorry . ''"
"beaming , i turn to the elevator as the doors swish open ."
"so blinded am i by my luminous good fortune that i stride into the elevator car without noticing the person trying to step out of it ."
"i reel backward , having collided with the human equivalent of a solid brick wall ."
"jeez , i thought this was a tech company , not a holding room for the iron man competition ."
"i think i actually bruised something on this guy 's sharply cut muscles ."
"`` sorry about that , '' a voice says from about a foot over my head , `` i hope i did n't hurt you , or ... '' the voice is oddly familiar , though i ca n't place where i may have heard it before ."
"a commercial , maybe ?"
"or the radio ?"
"it trails off into distracted silence , and i look up for some more clues as to whose it might be ."
"the face looking down at me is utterly gorgeous-sculpted , symmetrical , and engaged ."
"a short crop of dark hair and a hint of stubble on the mans 's razor-like jawline perfects his look ."
"there 's a pair of dark rimmed glasses perched on his straight nose , and for a moment the overhead light glares against the lenses , obscuring his eyes from me ."
"but then he shifts , ever so slightly , and i can see his blue eyes clear as day ."
"i recognize them at once , from the very core of me ."
"how could i not ?"
"i 've only thought about them every day , at least once a day , for the past eight years ."
"emerson sawyer is standing right in front of me ."
"and from the look in those all too familiar eyes , i know full well that he recognizes me , too ."
"`` ah !"
"here he is ! ''"
"i hear cooper say , as if from very far away ."
"`` emerson , i thought you were n't due in for another couple of hours ? ''"
"`` i was able to catch an earlier flight , '' emerson replies , his eyes still locked on me ."
"now that i 've placed that voice , every syllable he utters twists my heartstrings ."
"his voice is lower , now ."
"richer ."
"he 's even taller than he was when we last met , at least by a couple of inches ."
"his body was muscular even when we were kids , but now every ounce of boyish baby fat has melted from his frame , leaving nothing but a perfectly cut form in its wake ."
"he 's wearing perfectly-fitted dark wash jeans , a white cotton button down , and those designer black-rimmed glasses ."
"no wonder i did n't recognize him at first-emerson 's transformed from a grungy , angry teenage boy to a successful , intellectual tech genius ... a tech genius who works for the same company i just landed a job at , who 's supposed to show me the ropes of my new position , and who clearly was n't briefed on the fact that i , abby rowan , was going to be his new protege ."
"`` i , uh , really have to run , '' i say , my voice faint ."
"`` i have a ... i 've got to ... '' `` no worries ."
"we 'll see you soon ! ''"
"cooper says ."
"`` emerson here will teach you everything you need to know next week . ''"
"`` right , '' i say , my eyes locking onto emerson 's once more ."
"`` ok. well ."
"bye . ''"
"i skirt around emerson 's tall , built form , all but dive into the elevator , and jab the `` close door '' button with as much ferocity as i can muster ."
"the second those doors snap shut again , i fall back against the elevator wall , my chest heaving , trying not to burst into tears ."
"i feel like i 'm going to faint ."
"or be sick ."
"how could i have possibly not known that emerson works for bastian these days ?"
"what are the chances that we 'd end up face-to-face like this , after all these years ?"
"and what the hell am i supposed to do now ?"
"i burst back out of the front doors , gulping down deep breaths as best i can ."
"all around me , new yorkers brush past , completely unaware that i 'm having the strangest , most disorienting day of my life ."
"but , that 's new york city for you-the best and worst place ever to have a panic attack ."
"struggling to regain a modicum of composure , i straighten myself up and make to book it away from the bastian offices ."
"i get about three steps , too , before i feel a strong hand catch mine ."
"`` abby , '' i hear emerson say , `` abby , wait- '' `` what did you do , scurry down the drain pipe ? ''"
"i breathe , spinning around to face him ."
"`` i prefer the stairs to the drainpipe , but thanks for the tip , '' he replies , looking at me with dazed wonder ."
"`` i ca n't believe you 're here . ''"
"`` i know ."
"i 'm sorry , '' i say quickly , stepping out of the busy sidewalk traffic ."
"`` i had no idea you work here , emerson ."
"if i 'd known , i never would have applied . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"he says , taking a step toward me ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` i did n't mean to show up here , unannounced , and ... you know ."
"crash your party , '' i babble , unable to keep my eyes on his face for long ."
"in the last eight years , his gorgeousness has solidified into sheer perfection ."
"i can only hope that time has treated me half as well ."
"`` i promise , i 'll shoot cooper an email this weekend and tell him i ca n't accept the job . ''"
"`` abby , i do n't want you to do that , '' emerson says , his brow furrowing slightly ."
"`` if you 'd just listen to me for a minute , i could tell you that i 'm not mad about your being here . ''"
"`` you 're not ? ''"
"i ask , surprised , `` but ... why not ? ''"
"`` because we 're not ten years old , and this is n't a 'no girls allowed ' clubhouse , for one , '' emerson laughs ."
"`` it 's ... wonderful to see you , abby ."
"seriously ."
"i ca n't quite believe that it 's happening , but ... '' `` yeah , '' i laugh nervously , `` i certainly was n't expecting to run into you , well ... ever . ''"
"`` how the hell have you been ? ''"
"he asks , laying a hand on my shoulder ."
"my skin sparks at his gentle , familiar touch ."
"`` you look amazing . ''"
"`` says you , '' i chortle inelegantly ."
"nice one , abby , i chide myself ."
"`` yeah , says me , '' emerson smiles ."
"we lapse into silence , staring at each other there on the sidewalk ."
"my heart is still hammering against my ribcage , my knees shake uncontrollably ."
"seeing emerson again is like a dream ."
"a very sexy dream ."
"but that said , i need to wake up , now ."
"the sooner the better ."
"`` i really should go , '' i insist , edging away , `` this is wild and everything , but i do n't think we should draw it out , you know ?"
"i 'll just leave you to your company , and find some other agencies to apply to , and- '' `` i just told you i do n't want you to turn down the job , '' emerson says , with just the slightest note of hardness ."
"`` yeah , well ."
"i do want to turn it down , '' i shoot back , a bit annoyed at his tone ."
"`` why 's that ? ''"
"he insists , crossing his arms ."
"`` gee ."
"i wonder , '' i reply , rolling my eyes ."
"`` working side-by-side with my estranged ex-stepbrother slash ... '' `` slash what ? ''"
"emerson asks , his eyes hard on my face ."
"`` i just think it would be a terrible idea , '' i say flatly , `` but , hey , maybe i 'll see you at a conference sometime , or- '' `` or over drinks , '' he cuts me off , the corner of his mouth twisting up into his signature , roguish grin ."
"`` drinks ? ''"
"i reply , raising an eyebrow ."
"`` what drinks are those ? ''"
"`` the drinks we 're going to have tomorrow night ."
"i know a great martini bar around here ."
"it 's not as good as champagne in a motel room ... '' my heart flips over as he immediately brings up our fated night as lovers ."
"christ , he knows how to go right for the jugular , does n't he ?"
"`` last time i checked , i had n't agreed to a drink , '' i remind him ."
"`` true ."
"but you know what tomorrow is , do n't you ? ''"
"he grins ."
"of course ."
"if saturday is my birthday , then tomorrow is his ."
"`` you want to spend your birthday ... with me ? ''"
"i ask ."
"`` i do , '' he replies ."
"`` do n't you have some leggy , blonde supermodel to entertain ? ''"
"i shoot back ."
"`` several , '' he says without missing a beat , `` but i 'd still rather hang out with you ."
"meet me at clinton and houston at eight ."
"wear something fancy . ''"
"i know that there 's no way he 's going to let me off the hook , here ."
"the best i can do is say yes now and blow him off tomorrow ."
"`` fine , '' i say crisply , extending my hand for him to shake , `` see you then . ''"
"i swallow a gasp as he scoops up my hand , draws it to his lips , and plants a kiss there ."
"someone turned into a gentlemen over the past eight years ."
"i wonder how the hell that happened ?"
"`` looking forward to it , '' he smiles , holding onto my hand for longer than is necessary ."
"`` and do n't you dare blow me off , ab ."
"it is my birthday , after all . ''"
"i turn on my heel and hurry away , feeling all the blood in my body rush to my head ."
"it 's a good thing i 'm familiar with this city by now , because i ca n't pay a lick of attention to anything all the way home ."
"in the blink of an eye i 'm staggering , dazedly , back into my apartment ."
"i drop my purse onto the floor and flop onto the couch , staring straight ahead of me , unseeing ."
"riley pokes her head out of her bedroom as she hears me enter ."
"`` hey !"
"how 'd it go ? ''"
"she asks ."
"`` i got the job , '' i tell her , my voice flat ."
"`` that 's great , abby ! ''"
"she squeals , rushing out to join me on the couch ."
"she stops short at my glazed expression ."
"`` abby ?"
"is n't that great ? ''"
"`` sure , '' i tell her , `` the job is great ."
"it 's perfect , actually ."
"amazing company , good salary , nice benefits ."
"oh !"
"and emerson sawyer happens to work there , too ."
"so there 's that . ''"
"riley stares at me blankly ."
"i have n't uttered emerson 's name for years-well , not while sober , anyway ."
"`` are you shitting me ? ''"
"riley hisses ."
"`` you saw emerson today ?"
"at your new company ? ''"
"`` oh yeah ."
"he 's going to be showing me the ropes , '' i tell her ."
"`` or he would be , if i was going to take the job ."
"which i 'm obviously not . ''"
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"riley exclaims ."
"`` why the hell would you not take it ? ''"
"`` did you miss the part about emerson working there ? ''"
"i shoot back ."
"`` as in my one-time brother , long-lost lover , walked out of my life forever and broke my heart into a million little pieces emerson ? ''"
"`` no , i caught that loud and clear , '' riley replies , slinging an arm over my shoulder ."
"`` and there 's no way you 're passing up a dream job because he happens to be working at the same company ."
"if anything , his working there should be a perk ! ''"
"`` what , '' i say , narrowing my eyes ."
"`` now you can rekindle your romance at last ! ''"
"riley exclaims , `` it 's kismet ! ''"
"`` it 's a train wreck waiting to happen , '' i correct her ."
"`` in case you 're forgetting , we did n't exactly end on great footing , emerson and i . ''"
"`` so what ?"
"it was your parents who fucked everything up back then , '' riley presses , `` you could totally hit it off now that you 're adults . ''"
"`` god ."
"did you give him a pep talk too or something ? ''"
"i ask , shaking my head , `` he asked me out for a birthday drink about three seconds after we 'd run into each other . ''"
"`` what ?"
"! ''"
"riley shrieks , pulling me to my feet ."
"`` he asked you out ?"
"!"
"for when ?"
"! ''"
"`` tomorrow , '' i tell her , wiggling out of her excited grasp ."
"`` but do n't get your hopes up , it 's not happening ."
"no way ."
"no how . ''"
"all at once , riley snaps from giddy girlfriend to drill sergeant mode ."
"stepping into my path , she plants her hands on her hips and levels a glare at me that could cut through diamond ."
"`` abigail cecily rowan , '' she begins ."
"`` for the past eight years , i have watched you pine away for this person , miss him beyond all comprehension , and refuse to get serious with anyone else because no one could ever take his place in your heart ."
"now , all of a sudden , fate has deposited him back into your lap , and you 're seriously thinking of bailing ?"
"that , my dear , just will not do ."
"i am not going to stand by while you flip off destiny and forever ruin your happily-ever-after chances because you 're afraid of getting hurt again ."
"you will take this job ."
"you will let emerson back into your life ."
"and you will start tomorrow with a drink on his birthday ."
"do i make myself clear ? ''"
"looking into riley 's furious face , i realize two things ."
"first , i 've been dying for someone to give me permission to see what happens from here with emerson ."
"i do n't know how to give it to myself , of course , so thank god she 's here ."
"second , even if i did n't want to see him ever again , she would make me anyway ."
"so , this is looking like a win-win ."
"`` will you at least help me pick out something to wear ? ''"
"i ask softly ."
"`` please , '' she scoffs , `` as if i 'd let you dress yourself for something this important . ''"
"and just like that , the matter is settled ."
"i let myself consider the possibility that maybe running into emerson today was n't a cruel joke from the universe , but a gift ."
"a super sexy , super loaded , super intelligent gift wrapped up in an incredible person that i 've loved since i was a kid , that is ."
"chapter thirteen after trying on twenty outfits , getting in at least three fights with riley , and nearly booking a plane ticket to canada rather than going through with this evening , i make it out the door to meet emerson ."
"he 's asked me to meet him back on the lower east side , just a stone 's throw from the bastian offices ."
"i arrive a few minutes after eight and linger on the corner ."
"the birthday boy is nowhere in sight ."
"riley dressed me up in a deep red dress with a low-cut back and tasteful scoop neckline ."
"my blonde hair is arranged in a loose chignon , and the warm spring night does n't even require me to wear a jacket ."
"my stomach is a little fluttery , and i 'm still halfway convinced that i dreamed up seeing emerson the other day , but i 'm willing to stand here for another five seconds or so before i flee ."
"five ... i count down in my head ."
"four ... three ..."
"i feel a hand on the small of my back and spin around sharply to find emerson standing before me ."
"and of course , he looks utterly fantastic ."
"a gray blazer , light slacks , and trendy suede loafers have him looking right at home in this neighborhood ."
"and he 's lost the glasses , too-the better for me to ogle his twenty-five-year-old-or rather , twenty-six-year-old face ."
"`` you showed up , '' he grins , his eyes gleaming as he gives me a subtle once over ."
"`` yeah , well , '' i shrug , burning up under his gaze ."
"`` i ca n't resist a martini , so . ''"
"`` hey , i 'll take it , '' he replies ."
"`` come on ."
"the bar 's right over here . ''"
"i clutch onto my tiny black purse as emerson leads us over to an unremarkable doorway embedded in the busy line of shops ."
"he raps the door three times quickly , then twice at a slower pace ."
"i cock an eyebrow at his antics , but before i can say anything , the door swings open for us ."
"`` it 's sort of a speakeasy type place , '' he explains , nodding for me to follow him ."
"`` just a little bit exclusive . ''"
"and he 's not kidding , either ."
"as i step into the dimly lit bar after him , i feel my jaw drop ."
"the place is elegant , impeccable , and super swanky ."
"i almost laugh , remembering the little seafood shack we went to on his eighteenth birthday ."
"how far we 've come !"
"there are only a dozen or so people in here , all of them looking perfect ."
"this must be some elite , secret spot , known only to the rich and famous ."
"wait a minute ... is emerson rich and famous now himself ?"
"`` this is my favorite table , '' he tells me , sinking into a plush corner booth ."
"`` you have a favorite table here ? ''"
"i breathe , sinking down beside him ."
"`` sure , '' he grins , `` and a favorite drink too . ''"
"i gape as a martini appears on the table before emerson ."
"he winks at the server , who clearly knows emerson 's usual order ."
"the server , dressed in a finer suit than any of the men i 've dated , asks me for my order ."
"`` i 'll ... have what he 's having , '' i say faintly ."
"the man nods and hurries off to fix a drink for me ."
"i look around at the exquisite room , the beautiful patrons , and the specter from my past sitting across the table from me ."
"`` ok , '' i say at last , `` this , my friend , is officially bizarre . ''"
"`` i guess it sort of is , '' emerson laughs , more than happy to acknowledge the strangeness of our reunion ."
"`` but , what good thing in life is n't a little surreal ?"
"i say we run with it . ''"
"a perfect martini materializes before me ."
"i thank the server , pluck up the cocktail , and hold up my glass in a toast ."
"`` well , happy birthday , emerson , '' i say , `` i hope you enjoy your one night of being older than me as much as you did when we were kids . ''"
"`` oh , i think i will , '' he smiles , clinking his glass to mine ."
"i take a sip of my drink and freeze , savoring the mind-blowing deliciousness of it ."
"this is top-shelf vodka ."
"the kind that ought to be kept in a safe ."
"a drink like this must cost a fortune ."
"and this is emerson 's usual ?"
"`` so , i guess the past eight years have treated you well ? ''"
"i ask , stunned by the fineness of the liquor ."
"`` i 've done ok for myself , '' emerson nods ."
"`` well , since there 's no elegant segue to be found here , start from the beginning , '' i tell him , `` how 's your life been , tank ? ''"
"`` oof , '' he cringes , `` using my old lacrosse nickname ?"
"harsh . ''"
"`` yeah , well ."
"old age has hardened me , '' i say , trying to keep a straight face ."
"`` now spill ! ''"
"`` ok , ok , '' emerson says , taking a sip of his drink ."
"`` well , when we last saw each other , shit was going down in flames ."
"mom had just relapsed , obviously , and i had just ... well ... '' `` kicked the shit out of grade-a douchebag and gotten expelled , '' i finish his thought ."
"`` that would be correct , '' emerson nods ."
"`` mom and i picked up and left ."
"we landed at her sister 's place in pennsylvania for a minute ."
"we got mom into rehab , and i found a little apartment outside of philly ."
"nice town , you know ."
"i did n't do much for the next year except visit my mom , take odd jobs to pay rent , and tool around on the computer ."
"i do n't think you knew this about me in high school , but i 've always been kind of a tech nerd ."
"i became fascinated with programming , data , building things that other people could use ."
"i got my ged , and told myself i 'd take a year to learn some more about programming before applying to college ."
"i took some courses in the city , and found out that i was pretty damn good at the whole thing ."
"the app craze was only just about to take off as i put together my first real project ."
"with a little bit of luck , and a whole lot of venture capital backing , the thing took off ."
"i sold my app , made a ton ."
"overnight , everything was different ."
"so instead of going to college , i just kept building , and thinking , and meeting new people ."
"eventually , i ran into cooper , and he all but handed the european offices of bastian to me on a silver platter ."
"i 've been there for a couple of years , and it 's been amazing . ''"
"`` so you 're telling me that you went from bad boy jock to tech millionaire ? ''"
"i ask , staring at him across the table ."
"`` close , '' he says , unable to contain his proud but modest smile ."
"`` i went from bad boy jock to tech billionaire . ''"
"my eyes go wide as i try to comprehend the thing he 's just told me ."
"emerson 's smile fades as i sit silently beside him ."
"`` sorry , was that a total asshole move ? ''"
"he asks , frowning , `` i do n't know what i was thinking , just bringing that up- '' `` no , emerson , '' i say quickly , reaching for his hand before i can stop myself ."
"`` it 's amazing ."
"i 'm just so , so proud of you . ''"
"in unison , we glance down at our now-clasped hands on the table ."
"bashful as ever , i lift my fingers away ."
"my skin tingles where it glanced against his ."
"as if i did n't have enough reason to be nervous around him before , now it turns out that he 's not only my long-lost first love , but also a goddamn billionaire ?"
"this is shaping up to be quite a week , i 'll tell you ."
"`` but ... what about you ? ''"
"emerson says , breaking the pointed silence , `` how did things play out for you ? ''"
"`` well , '' i begin , taking a nice big sip of my drink ."
"`` from the point of our parents ' disastrous one-day marriage , my dad totally wiped out ."
"relapsed harder than ever ."
"really just never recovered ."
"my grandparents took me in until high school was over , and then i moved to the city to study at the new school with riley ."
"we 've been living together ever since , in this great place my grandparents own ... ugh ."
"sorry ."
"i sound like such a mooch . ''"
"`` no , not at all , '' emerson assures me , `` you 've got to use the resources you have , right ? ''"
"`` i 'll take that , '' i smile ."
"`` what else ... i studied graphic design and digital media , got my masters , and voila !"
"here i am . ''"
"`` design , huh ?"
"so you still get to be an artist , '' he says , his eyes resting warmly on my face ."
"i smile , touched that he 's remembered my childhood passion ."
"`` in a way , yes , '' i reply ."
"`` and i guess you 'll be seeing a lot more of my work soon , what with your kind of being my boss and all . ''"
"`` i 'm your colleague , not your boss , '' emerson insists ."
"`` uh-huh ."
"sure , '' i tease , `` whatever you say , boss . ''"
"`` careful , lackey , '' he shoots back , jumping on my joke , `` or i 'll have to dock your pay . ''"
"`` ooh , i 'm shaking in my panties , '' i snicker ."
"my cheeks flame red as i realize that it 's taken me all of five minutes to bring my panties into the conversation ."
"`` relax , '' emerson chuckles , seeing my face ."
"`` this is n't courtney haines ' house party ."
"i 'm not gon na make you hand them over or anything ."
"unless you really want to . ''"
"`` duly noted , '' i tell him , all but swigging my martini ."
"`` i hear she 's on broadway now , '' emerson goes on , glancing down at his drink ."
"`` really , '' i say , feeling an old trill of jealousy run through me as i remember the redheaded beauty who snagged emerson 's attention all those years ago ."
"`` yeah ."
"almost won a tony and everything , '' emerson says , plucking up his olive and popping it into his mouth ."
"`` maybe i should call her up and see how she 's doing ? ''"
"i 'm about to say something polite and change the subject , until i see the look in emerson 's gorgeous blue eyes ."
"`` are you baiting me , sawyer ? ''"
"i ask ."
"`` is it working , rowan ? ''"
"he winks ."
"`` you 're terrible , '' i inform him , relieved that he was n't serious about courtney ."
"`` it 's true , '' he sighs dramatically , `` some things never change . ''"
"`` besides , there surely is n't room for courtney in your harem , '' i go on , `` with your whole gorgeous bad boy billionaire thing , you 've probably got a girlfriend for every day of the week . ''"
"`` nope , '' emerson replies , `` but thanks for calling me gorgeous . ''"
"`` like you do n't know , '' i shoot back , `` so then , just the one girlfriend for you ? ''"
"`` i 'm afraid not , '' he says ."
"`` fiancee ? ''"
"i ask , with mounting dread , `` wife ? ''"
"`` well , there is roxie ... '' he says , `` she 's very important to me . ''"
"`` roxie ? ''"
"i ask , `` you 're with a woman named roxie ?"
"who the hell- ? ''"
"`` she 's my west highland terrier , '' he cuts me off with a smirk ."
"`` but good to see you 're still protective of me , ab . ''"
"`` i 'm not-i just- '' i sputter , `` i 'm just curious , is all . ''"
"`` that makes two of us , '' he replies , `` i 'm expecting a report on your love life , too . ''"
"`` or lack thereof , you mean ? ''"
"i ask drily ."
"`` i just finished grad school ."
"that means my most significant romantic relationship at the moment is with my pizza delivery man . ''"
"`` who is he ?"
"i 'll throttle him , '' emerson says , raising his fists like a cartoon leprechaun ."
"but the memory of the beat down he gave tucker all those years ago is too fresh for that particular joke to be funny ."
"for the first time these evening , the silence between us grows tense ."
"despite our relatively breezy reunion so far , there 's a lot of ugly , buried emotions hanging between us ."
"i 've spent a good part of the last eight years being furious with emerson for disappearing on me when i needed him ."
"i 've been hurt , angry , and more than anything , just terribly sad to have lost him ."
"all that feeling ca n't just evaporate because he 's resurfaced with a shit ton of money and nicer biceps than ever before ."
"`` tell me what you 're thinking , '' he says with quiet firmness , leaning toward me ."
"`` honestly ? ''"
"i reply , `` i 'm thinking about all the imaginary fights i 've had with you these past few years ."
"all the things i 'd dream of saying to you , if we ever ran into each other again . ''"
"`` like what ? ''"
"he asks intently ."
"`` you do n't want me to tell you , '' i mutter , `` your eyebrows might get singed off . ''"
"`` that bad , huh ? ''"
"he asks ."
"`` that bad , '' i assure him ."
"`` well , i had plenty of imaginary conversations with you , too , '' he tells me , moving closer by just an inch ."
"`` want to know how most of them went ? ''"
"`` i 'm not sure- '' `` usually , they revolved around me apologizing for vanishing into thin air on you , '' he cuts me off , `` and for leaving you to deal with the fallout on your own ."
"and hey , now that you 're actually sitting here with me , i can tell you-i 'm sorry . ''"
"`` i do n't think sorry can begin to fix it , '' i whisper , staring down at my drink ."
"`` you left , emerson ."
"left me alone in that house , with my dad , after the way he treated us ."
"he could have hurt me , if riley had n't shown up to get me ."
"did you even care ? ''"
"`` of course i cared , '' he said fiercely , `` but try to imagine being me in that moment ."
"having my mother bring the whole family crashing down all on her own ... it was humiliating ."
"i felt like absolute scum for being my parents ' kid ."
"i could n't even look at you , i was so ashamed of who i was ."
"and so furious that i could n't do anything to help or protect you . ''"
"`` is that why you nearly killed tucker ? ''"
"i ask softly ."
"`` i guess it is , '' emerson allows , shaking his head , `` i was n't really thinking about it much at the time ."
"to be honest , abby , i do n't lose much sleep over what i did to him ."
"in my mind , that 's what he had coming from the moment he ... anyway ."
"i had to disappear , ab ."
"i could n't stand the idea of you being as ashamed of me as i was . ''"
"`` i was never ashamed of you , '' i burst out , `` never once , emerson ."
"that was just some crazy idea you cooked up in your own damn mind ."
"i never gave a shit about our families ' money and standing ."
"you know that ."
"or at least you should have known . ''"
"`` you 're right , '' emerson murmurs , reaching for my hand , `` i should have ."
"and for that , again , i am truly sorry ."
"but do n't you think for a second that i would n't have come running back if you 'd ever needed me . ''"
"`` how would you have known if i did ? ''"
"i ask , exasperated ."
"`` i followed you , '' he says , `` online , i mean ."
"your social media presence was pretty remarkably unprotected when you were younger ."
"for a while , i scoped you out on facebook , myspace , checked in to see how you were doing ."
"but once you got to college , and it seemed like your whole life was just opening up in front of you ... i knew you 'd be ok ."
"i knew you did n't need me anymore . ''"
"`` that 's not true , '' i whisper , my eyes stinging with unexpected tears ."
"`` i did need you , emerson ."
"so much ... '' `` i needed you too , '' he replies , rubbing his thumb against my hand , `` but we could n't be in each others ' lives then ."
"not with everything that had happened ."
"but look ."
"we seem to have found a way back in again . ''"
"`` so it would seem , '' i smile softly ."
"`` i 've spent the past eight years wondering what i would say to you , if i ever saw you again , '' emerson murmurs , his voice dipping low ."
"i know that dip , know what it means ."
"between that and the gleam in his eye , his intentions are pretty clear ."
"and despite every ounce of logic i possess , i can feel myself responding to his lead ."
"`` what do you want to say , then ? ''"
"i ask , my own voice soft and husky ."
"my heart feels like a kick drum as emerson moves closer to me ."
"our sides brush against each other as he moves his hand up my arm , pulling me in ."
"`` it turns out , i do n't want to say anything , '' he says , his words gravelly and ardent ."
"his lips move ever closer to mine , and i can feel my mouth lifting to his , as if of its own accord ."
"emerson goes on , his mouth nearly on mine , `` i 'd rather show you ... '' `` hey emerson ! ''"
"someone says from across the room ."
"i jerk away from emerson as a trio of familiar faces make their way across the room ."
"i recognize the two men and woman as some of the young people manning the communal desk at bastian ."
"my new coworkers , as it were ."
"and they 've just happened upon me about to suck face with my superior ."
"i stare at emerson , my mind scrambling to figure out what my heart wants ."
"he just looks back at me with frustrated desire , forcing a smile as his colleagues come over ."
"`` how 's it going , bradley ? ''"
"emerson asks , as the stylish threesome comes to a stop before us , `` tyler , emily-do you guys all know abby ? ''"
"`` you 're the new recruit , right ? ''"
"the man called bradley asks ."
"he 's doing the whole trendy-pseudo-rustic look , full beard and all ."
"and from the barely-concealed amusement on his face , i know he 's hip to what was about to happen between me and emerson ."
"they all are ."
"`` that 's me , '' i say faintly ."
"looking up at them , then across the table at emerson , i feel like we 're back in our hometown diner-that night emerson 's lax bros nearly gave me a heart attack ."
"i feel the panic beginning to rise inside of me at the mere thought of it ."
"`` you guys mind if we join you ? ''"
"asks emily , the chic hipster with bright violet hair ."
"`` i was actually just going to head out , '' i say , grabbing my purse and rising quickly to my feet ."
"`` i 'll have to catch a drink with you guys some other time ! ''"
"`` abby , '' emerson says , his smile tightening ."
"`` you do n't have to go already- '' `` i really do , '' i shoot back firmly ."
"`` what about your drink ? ''"
"he presses , as our coworkers drink in the tense drama ."
"with my eyes locked on emerson , i raise my martini glass and knock back the rest , chugging the insanely expensive and delicious liquor just to spite him ."
"he holds my gaze , his expression hardening into that unreadable mask i know so well ."
"`` see you guys later , '' i say to emerson and our three flabbergasted coworkers ."
"`` you have a lovely evening . ''"
"without another word , i turn on my heel and dash out of the bar ."
"i 've barely made it back onto the busy street before the tears come ."
"i should have known that this-being alone with emerson-would be too much for me all at once ."
"there 's too much history there , too much pain , for some breezy birthday drinks to be possible ."
"i hurry back toward the subway , cursing myself for being such a damn idiot ."
"`` i 'd love to not make this running-after-you thing a habit , '' i hear emerson 's terse voice say from over my shoulder ."
"`` there 's an easy fix for that , '' i snap back , `` stop running after me . ''"
"i draw myself up short as emerson places his staggering , perfect body in my path ."
"`` i did n't mean to freak you out , '' he tells me , `` i should n't have pushed you ."
"it 's just ... i ca n't pretend that i do n't still want you , abby ."
"that i do n't still care- '' `` goddammit emerson , '' i exclaim , wrapping my arms around my waist , `` have n't you ever heard of subtlety ? ''"
"`` tried it once ."
"not a fan , '' he shrugs ."
"`` this is n't going to work , '' i tell him , shaking my head , `` we ca n't just pick up right where we left off after that night at the beach . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"he insists , taking my hands in his ."
"`` because you took a sledgehammer to my heart , you asshole ! ''"
"i say , tearing away from his grasp ."
"`` i 've loved you for the better part of a decade , but we 're not kids anymore , emerson ."
"we ca n't just throw caution to the wind , you live in europe , and- '' `` we 're twenty-five ! ''"
"he laughs , incredulously , `` we can do whatever we like . ''"
"`` you 're twenty-six , '' i remind him , `` and i 've spent the last eight years picking up the pieces of my life on my own ."
"i 'm not about to let you shatter them again . ''"
"`` is that what you think i 'd do , if you gave me another chance ? ''"
"he asks , his voice hard ."
"`` no , '' i reply , feeling my bottom lip begin to tremble , `` i know it 's what you 'd do . ''"
"his eyes flash with wounded sorrow as i barrel past him ."
"this time , he lets me go ."
"i charge away , back up to my haven on the upper west side , struggling to hold it together ."
"i manage to make it all the way home before my own grief spills over ."
"by the time i glance at my bedside clock , i see that it 's after midnight ."
"it 's officially my own twenty-sixth birthday ."
"and would you look at that ?"
"i 'm lying here alone , miserable as ever ."
"`` see , this is why i hate birthdays , '' i mutter to myself , surrendering to sleep at last ."
"chapter fourteen it seems that emerson has taken the hint ."
"there are n't a thousand voicemails and texts waiting on my phone in the morning , and he does n't appear out of thin air all day during my birthday ."
"riley , unable to contain herself , wakes me up with a wonderful breakfast spread to start the day off right ."
"one look at my face and she does n't press for details about the night before ."
"she 's a saint , that woman ."
"we take our time waking up , head out for a hot yoga class , and take a nice long walk along the hudson river together ."
"eventually , i fill her in on what went down at drinks last night ."
"she listens pensively as i give her the scoop ."
"`` you may not want to hear this , '' she begins , glancing at me as we stroll by the water ."
"`` that probably means i need to hear it though , right ? ''"
"i sigh , `` go ahead ."
"shoot . ''"
"`` it sounds like you 're scared by how much you still care about him , '' riley says , laying a hand on my shoulder ."
"`` and you 're terrified of history repeating itself . ''"
"`` i do still care about him , '' i admit , surprised by the knot in my throat ."
"`` i never stopped caring about him . ''"
"`` i know , '' riley smiles sadly , `` i 've been with you these last eight years since he disappeared from your life ."
"but abby ... you have to remember that there 's one huge difference between then and now . ''"
"`` his pecs ? ''"
"i offer ."
"`` you should see them , ri- '' `` not what i meant , '' she laughs ."
"`` i was going to say , you were kids when everything went wrong before ."
"you had to answer to your horrible , selfish parents ."
"now , you have no one to answer to but yourselves . ''"
"`` maybe that 's what 's freaking me out , '' i say softly , `` there 's no one to blame if things go wrong again ."
"if we mess it up this time ... it 's because we 're not actually right for each other . ''"
"`` being a grownup sucks , do n't it ? ''"
"riley laughs , shaking her head ."
"`` but you know what else sucks ?"
"squandering a wonderful relationship with someone you 're nuts about , just because you 're scared . ''"
"`` how can you always know the right thing to say ? ''"
"i ask her , amazed ."
"`` i 'm just a genius , '' she sighs , as we turn toward home , `` nbd . ''"
"my grandparents are swinging by the apartment to check up on the place and have drinks before we go out to dinner , but that wo n't be until early this evening ."
"i have the whole lazy late afternoon to myself ."
"which would be fine and dandy if i could do anything but lay around thinking about emerson ."
"i need to check in with him about last night and explain my freak out ."
"but every time i reach for my cell , something stops me ."
"`` come on , miss 26-year-old , '' i mutter sternly , staring down at my phone , `` put on your big girl panties and give him a- '' i let out a very undignified yelp as the phone begins to vibrate in my hands ."
"dropping the device onto my bed in surprise , i peer down at it and feel my stomach flip ."
"there 's a text on my screen that simply reads : hey abby , it 's emerson ."
"i grab up the phone and text back before i lose my nerve ."
"me : hey , i was just about to call you ."
"i want to talk ."
"him : so do i ."
"how do you feel about doing it in person ?"
"me : oh , i do n't think i have time to come all the way back downtown before my plans tonight ."
"him : you do n't have to come downtown ."
"me : no ?"
"i jump a foot in the air as my apartment buzzer rings ."
"another text arrives in its wake : him : nope ."
"`` are you expecting a package ? ''"
"riley calls from the living room ."
"`` no , ri , it 's him ! ''"
"i gasp , yanking open my bedroom door ."
"`` emerson is here ?"
"at our apartment ?"
"! ''"
"she breathes excitedly , `` well , what are you waiting for ?"
"buzz him up ! ''"
"`` but ."
"i ."
"what if- '' i stammer , biting my lip ."
"`` oh , for christ 's sake , '' riley groans ."
"she marches across the room and pushes the `` door '' button on the buzzer , granting emerson access to our building ."
"`` you 're welcome , '' she grins , marching toward her room , `` i 'll be in my boudoir ."
"call if you need any further intervention , yeah ? ''"
"`` thanks , '' i say weakly , paralyzed as i stare at the front door ."
"at least i made an effort to look presentable today ."
"i 've got my favorite pair of skinny jeans on , a slouchy white tee with a charcoal cardigan , and some eclectic pieces of jewelry i 've picked up at the brooklyn flea market ."
"my blonde hair hangs in loose , easy waves , and my favorite red matte lipstick finishes off the look ."
"still , even knowing that i look my millennial-chic best , my heart nearly bursts out of my chest as i hear a knock on the door ."
"he 's here ."
"`` answer it or i will ! ''"
"riley trills from the other room ."
"`` ugh ."
"fine , '' i mutter , going to the door ."
"`` quit crackin ' the whip , would you ? ''"
"`` what 's that about whips ? ''"
"emerson grins , as i swing the door open ."
"`` oh , '' i stammer , taken aback by his perfect appearance yet again ."
"he 's wearing a black v-neck and gray jeans , and the smattering of stubble on his jaw is as sexy as ever ."
"the glasses are nowhere to be seen , which means his vibrant blue eyes are on full , gorgeous display ."
"the tee shirt cuts off just above his bulging , perfect biceps ."
"i spot a few new tattoos on his arms , too ."
"guess there 's still a bad boy mixed in with that tech billionaire ."
"`` no literal whips on hand , sorry to disappoint you , '' i laugh , moving aside to let him in ."
"`` what a shame , '' he sighs , taking a look around the apartment ."
"i 'm suddenly self-conscious of the ornate , elegant decor ."
"i know emerson has money now and everything , but the decadence of my grandparents ' apartment still has me feeling very uncool ."
"`` i know , this place is a bit much , '' i say nervously , watching his blue eyes rove around the space ."
"`` but , you know , it 's my grandparents ' ."
"they 're not exactly hip to the whole minimalism , eco-friendly movement ."
"actually , they 're stopping by soon for a little birthday celebration . ''"
"`` frank and jillian ? ''"
"emerson asks , laying on a parody of his most proper , upper-class voice ."
"`` what a delight ! ''"
"`` yeah ."
"not my idea of a good time , but they 're family ."
"and they 've also been supporting me my entire life ."
"so i can handle a bit of waspy tension once in a while , '' i reply ."
"`` i 'll be sure to get out of here before they show up , '' emerson says , `` would n't want anyone to have a heart attack on your birthday . ''"
"`` i 'm sure they 'd be happy to see you , '' i offer ."
"we look at each other for a moment before busting out laughing ."
"emerson is the last person on the planet my grandparents would want to run into , billionaire or no ."
"`` i doubt they 'd be impressed by something as gauche as 'new money ' , '' emerson chortles , settling down on the couch ."
"`` yes , how dare you be successful in this economy , young man , '' i reply , doing my best frank rowan impression as i settle down beside emerson ."
"we sit next to each other and lapse into silence ."
"i guess this is the moment where we 're supposed to address what went down last night , but it 's always hard to start ."
"`` i hope you do n't mind my swinging by , '' emerson begins , `` i know it 's an uninvited visit , but i wanted to talk to you before we got back into the office on monday . ''"
"`` right , '' i laugh , `` yeah , that might have been awkward . ''"
"`` i also did n't want to let the day pass without wishing you a happy birthday , '' he goes on , training those gorgeous eyes on me ."
"`` oh , '' i breathe , very aware of the slender space between us ."
"`` thanks , emerson . ''"
"`` has it been a good one so far ? ''"
"he asks softly ."
"`` it just got a lot better , to tell you the truth , '' i reply , my voice low and quiet ."
"i feel that panicked resistance rising in me the more my want of him grows , but i force myself to get through it ."
"deal with it ."
"i wo n't let my own fears fuck this moment up ."
"`` i 'm glad to hear it , '' emerson smiles , `` and i hope this is n't too forward , but i also wanted to make sure to give you your birthday present before the day was out . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"i laugh , turning to face him on the couch ."
"`` what do you mean , present ?"
"we only just ran into each other two days ago ."
"how did you already- ? ''"
"`` let 's just say i 've been holding onto it for a while , '' he says , reaching into the pocket of his jeans ."
"`` about eight years , as a matter of fact . ''"
"the world grinds to a halt around me as he produces a simple black ring box ."
"i stare at the tiny gift , my mind and heart making the obvious leap ."
"emerson watches my jaw hit the floor and rushes to assure me ."
"`` oh god ."
"do n't worry ."
"i would n't do that to you , '' he laughs ."
"`` right , '' i breathe , `` of course . ''"
"he goes to hand me the box , but at the last second holds it up over his head , out of my reach ."
"his favorite old joke from when we were kids ."
"and given that he 's got even more height on me now , the joke holds ."
"i give him a playful shove , and he finally hands the box to me ."
"my hands tremble as i force a placid smile onto my face and open the ring box ."
"am i relieved that he did n't just whip out an engagement ring , or was some ridiculous little corner of my mind hoping that he was going to ?"
"whatever the case may be , the question fades out of my mind as i lift the lid of the box and see what 's inside ."
"it 's a delicate silver ring , set with one gleaming freshwater pearl ."
"i know i 've seen this ring before ."
"but where ?"
"`` when we were at the beach for our birthdays , all those years ago , '' emerson says , watching me intently , `` we stopped at that one shop you liked so much in town , with all those handmade crafts and things ."
"you stared at this ring for a good five minutes , just admiring it ."
"you did n't say anything , of course , but i knew you loved it ."
"i waited until you were trying things on in the dressing room and bought it for you ."
"for your eighteenth birthday ."
"but with everything that actually ended up happening that day ... i never got a chance to give it to you ."
"well ."
"until now , that is . ''"
"`` you 've ... held onto this the whole time ? ''"
"i whisper , looking up at him in wonder , `` you 've had this ring for eight years , emerson ? ''"
"`` i guess some part of me always hoped i 'd have the chance to give it to you someday , '' he says softly ."
"`` and would you look at that ?"
"here you are . ''"
"`` here i am , '' i smile ."
"`` i never forgot about you , abby , '' he says , resting a hand on mine , `` not for a second ."
"through every other relationship , and date , and fling , i always had you at the back of my mind ."
"no one ever measured up to you ."
"i 'm not blaming you for my lack of committed relationships , of course ."
"it 's just ... i never wanted to settle down with anyone else ."
"because the person i really cared about was still out there ."
"only , i 'd already met and lost her . ''"
"`` you did n't lose me , '' i whisper , lacing my fingers through his ."
"`` we just ... misplaced each other for a while . ''"
"`` i 'll take that , '' he smiles , inching toward me ."
"i force myself to take a deep breath as we move closer , and closer ."
"the heat and nearness of him are making my head spin , and that 's not all ."
"i clench my thighs together , acutely aware of the throbbing need building between my legs ."
"just being close to him , alone in this room , is enough to turn me on ."
"it dawns on me , for the first time , that i do n't have say `` no '' in this moment ."
"nothing is stopping me from being with emerson the way i want to be ."
"`` god , i 've missed you , '' emerson murmurs fiercely , catching my face in hands ."
"`` well ."
"you know how i feel about showing and telling , sawyer , '' i whisper , my voice low and rasping with want ."
"`` that i do , '' he grins , those blue eyes mere inches from mine ."
"and with that , he tugs me tightly against him and brings his mouth to mine ."
"i bend my body to his , opening myself without a second thought ."
"the familiar taste of him , still the same after all these years , sets the synapses of my brain sparking , dredging up a million memories ."
"my every barrier and defense goes crumbling down as i run my fingers through his now-cropped brown hair ."
"i press my body flush against his as i feel his tongue sweep against mine ."
"he kisses me swiftly , ferociously , and i match his intensity at every stroke ."
"now that we 've given ourselves the permission to touch and be touched by each other , there 's no stopping us ."
"`` no one 's ever made me feel the way you do , '' i gasp , as emerson pulls me onto his lap , kissing down along my throat ."
"`` i just know you , abby , '' he growls , his hands running down the length of my body ."
"`` my god , you feel exactly the same ."
"the way your body moves , the way you respond to me ... '' `` i 've missed these hands , '' i groan softly , as emerson brushes his fingers against my tender inner thigh , runs his hands over the rise of my ass ."
"`` they 've missed you , '' he smiles devilishly , catching my lips in his once more ."
"i ca n't keep my hips from grinding against his as i straddle him on the couch ."
"our tongues glide against each other , twisting and caressing like i wish our limbs could , right this second ."
"my breath comes hard and fast as that throbbing between my legs grows more intense-more intent on getting what it wants ."
"i can already feel myself getting wet for him as he pulls me flush against him-lets me feel the telltale rise in his jeans ."
"`` no one 's ever known how to turn me on like you do , either , '' he says , his fierce blue eyes hard on my face ."
"`` i ca n't believe we 've gone so long without this , '' i breathe , taking his gorgeous , sculpted face in my hands ."
"`` we do n't have to wait any longer , '' he replies , turning his face to lay a kiss against my palm ."
"`` not if you do n't want to . ''"
"`` i do n't want to , '' i whisper , letting my sex rub ever-so-lightly against his stiff cock ."
"the feel of him pressing hard against me brings a sudden , untempered cry to my lips ."
"i just ca n't help myself as i feel the staggering bulk of him brush against my aching clit , even through layers of clothing ."
"the second my moan escapes into the air , my eyes go wide ."
"i clasp my hands over my mouth , but it 's too late ."
"riley 's bedroom door flies open , and i scramble off of emerson 's lap as she appears in the doorway in full action mode ."
"i 'm surprised she is n't carrying a frying pan or something ."
"`` are you ok ? ''"
"she demands , taking in the scene ."
"`` oh , sure ! ''"
"i laugh dementedly , leaping off of the couch ."
"`` we 're fine !"
"sorry ! ''"
"my best friend sees emerson 's flabbergasted , frustrated expression , not to mention the tousled state of my hair and clothes , and puts two and two together ."
"her game face is replaced by a knowing grin ."
"`` i thought i heard you scream , '' she says , feigning innocence ."
"`` i did n't mean to interrupt anything , or- '' `` it 's ok , '' i insist , shooting her a look that says , please shut the fuck up , dude ."
"`` is that emerson sawyer i see sitting on our couch ? ''"
"she goes on , crossing her arms with an amused smile on her lips ."
"`` that it is , '' emerson says , grinning gamely back at her as he stands ."
"he 's rolling with the interruption , just like that night when our post-dr. zhivago make-out session was interrupted by our parents-and the announcement of their doomed engagement ."
"he 's always been quick on his feet , my emerson ."
"my emerson ?"
"i ask myself , what 's this about my emerson , abby ?"
"`` man , it 's been forever ! ''"
"riley exclaims , `` you look great , man . ''"
"`` thanks ."
"you too , '' he replies , shoving his hands into his pockets ."
"the flush fades from his chiseled face ."
"good ."
"at least one of us is composed ."
"i probably look like a deer caught in the headlights ."
"who also happens to be in heat ."
"`` abby , did you offer our guest a drink ? ''"
"riley asks ."
"`` oh ."
"no , '' i mumble bashfully , `` i did n't ."
"emerson ? ''"
"`` sure , if you guys are having something , '' he says ."
"`` vodka tonics good for everyone ? ''"
"riley asks , making her way over to our home bar ."
"`` make mine a double , '' i mutter , trading glances with emerson ."
"he strides my way and leans close ."
"`` later , '' he whispers in my ear , `` just you wait . ''"
"`` are you trying to make me faint or something , sawyer ? ''"
"i whisper back ."
"`` not just yet , '' he winks , and goes to join riley at the bar ."
"`` here we go , '' she says , passing out the three cocktails and raising her glass ."
"`` to old friends , all grown up and kicking ass . ''"
"`` i 'll drink to that ! ''"
"emerson laughs ."
"`` hell yeah , '' i smile , clinking my glass to theirs ."
"`` and to your birthday , of course ! ''"
"riley adds ."
"`` of course ."
"happy birthday , abby , '' emerson says warmly , taking a sip of his drink ."
"my body may still be reeling with having had a moment of contact with emerson , but the mere knowledge that things between us are back on track is enough to keep me giddy ."
"besides , i 'm here with my best friend and long-lost lover ... who i 've been carrying a torch for almost the entire past decade , despite our asshole parents ' one-day marriage ."
"happy birthday to me , indeed ."
"the three of us settle down in the living room , riley and emerson catching each other up on their lives and careers ."
"i ca n't help but be wildly proud of these two ."
"neither one of them had any idea what they wanted to do with their futures as high school seniors , but now that they 've followed their passions , they 've made incredible lives for themselves ."
"hell , if anyone 's slacking on the whole bright shiny future thing , it 's me ."
"but maybe now that i 've got my job at bastian , things will start to take off for me , too ."
"at least , i hope that 's the case ."
"`` i do n't suppose you keep in touch with anyone from high school , emerson ? ''"
"riley asks , whipping us up a second round ."
"`` no one except courtney haines , '' i tease , nudging him ."
"we 're cozied up on the couch next to each other , casual as can be ."
"amazing how comfortable it is to be near him ."
"`` i do n't keep in touch with courtney haines , '' emerson laughs , nudging me back , `` or anyone , for that matter ."
"i consider myself a bit of a hometown expat . ''"
"`` that make three of us , '' riley replies , furnishing us with fresh cocktails ."
"`` in fact , if i had n't run into you two again , i doubt i 'd ever have run into a familiar face from those glory days , '' emerson goes on ."
"`` not even family ? ''"
"riley asks without thinking ."
"i shoot her a look , and she realizes her mistake at once , but it 's too late now ."
"`` well , mom 's still more or less living in the rehab revolving door , '' emerson says , not meeting anyone 's gaze ."
"`` and my dad ... he actually passed away , a few years after i left connecticut with my mom . ''"
"this is news to me , and i ca n't help but wrap my arm supportively around emerson 's back ."
"as if he needed any more pain to carry around on those broad shoulders of his ."
"`` i 'm so sorry , '' i murmur , `` i know how hard that is , emerson . ''"
"`` i actually thought about calling you , when it happened , '' he laughs shortly , `` i knew you 'd gone through the same thing ."
"could n't think of anyone else i 'd want to talk to more . ''"
"`` you could have , you know , '' i say softly ."
"`` well , '' emerson sighs , shaking off the sadness of his father 's passing , `` you 're here now , right ?"
"guess we 've just got some more catching up to do ."
"all of us . ''"
"we all return to our drinks as the conversation resumes ."
"i have n't eaten a ton today , so my drinks are really doing a number on me already ."
"just as i start wondering whether we should order a huge pizza to soak up some of this vodka , i remember what tonight actually has in store for me ."
"`` shit ."
"what time is it ? ''"
"i exclaim , standing up suddenly from the couch ."
"`` just about seven , '' emerson says , glancing at his watch ."
"`` why , what- ? ''"
"`` oh god , '' riley groans , looking up at me , `` your grandparents . ''"
"`` i 'm not dressed ."
"i do n't have time ."
"they 're going to be here any second , '' i cry , setting down my empty martini glass and setting off toward my bedroom to get changed ."
"but the second i spin around on my heel , i hear the buzzer ring out ."
"frank and jillian rowan have arrived for the evening ."
"`` well , shit , '' emerson laughs darkly , `` it 's a family reunion !"
"this should be fun . ''"
"`` relax , abby , '' riley says , anticipating my panic ."
"`` you 're a grown woman ."
"it 's none of their business who you spend your time with . ''"
"`` try telling them that , '' i mutter , anxiously buzzing them up ."
"`` look , i 'm sure it will be fine , '' emerson sighs , starting to gather his things , `` if nothing else , they 've got that whole snobby , fake-polite thing going on ."
"so it 's not like they 'll start anything with me ."
"rich people do n't do confrontation ."
"it 's not proper . ''"
"i 'm surprised to feel a twinge of annoyance at emerson 's generalizations ."
"my grandparents are n't perfect , but they 're the only family i have these days ."
"they 're the only people who have supported me through my life , even if that support has been more financial than emotional ."
"i 'm not ok with emerson slamming them ."
"`` are n't you a rich person now , too ? ''"
"i ask curtly , crossing my arms ."
"emerson raises an eyebrow , taken aback by my tone ."
"`` sure ."
"but i earned my money , '' he replies ."
"`` i have n't just been inheriting my advantages and coasting along . ''"
"`` like i 'm doing , you mean ? ''"
"i shoot back ."
"now i 'm really getting pissed off ."
"i thought that he , of all people , would n't be judgmental about something like money ."
"but i guess maybe i was wrong ."
"maybe having money has changed him ."
"`` you know i 'm not talking about you , '' he says , actually shocked by my reaction ."
"`` abby , you do n't coast ."
"you work your ass off , you 're great at what you do- '' `` well ."
"when you spend your whole life inheriting your advantages , you have a lot of time to devote to your interests , '' i say drily ."
"`` do n't put words in my mouth , '' emerson says sternly ."
"`` do n't spout orders at me , '' i return ."
"`` whoa , whoa , '' riley says , placing herself between us , `` back to your corners , you two . ''"
"`` he started it , '' i mutter , crossing my arms ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"emerson scoffs ."
"`` oh my god , '' riley groans , `` just because you 're in the same room again , does n't mean you get to revert back to your angst-ridden teenage selves . ''"
"before i can reply , the doorbell chimes ."
"my grandparents are right outside ."
"`` that 's my cue , '' emerson says , walking toward the door with me ."
"`` i 'm sorry for what i said ."
"i didn't- '' `` me too , '' i say quickly , pausing before the door ."
"riley is kind enough to go back into her room for the moment ."
"`` can i at least give you one last birthday kiss ? ''"
"emerson asks , catching my hand and placing the ring box onto my palm ."
"i nod , clutching the box to my chest ."
"emerson lowers his lips to mine , giving me a sweet , swift kiss goodnight ."
"i pocket the box , giddy and flushed , and pull open the front door ."
"my grandparents are revealed to us in all their finery ."
"i watch them go stock-still , forced smiles paralyzed in place , as they see emerson beside me ."
"it takes them a moment , but recognition floods in at last ."
"and the second it does , the goodwill drains from their eyes in an instant , replaced by sheer revulsion ."
"`` is that- ? ''"
"my grandmother breathes ."
"`` it is , '' emerson smiles , drawing himself up to his full , towering height ."
"`` good to see you again , jillian ."
"frank . ''"
"`` what the hell is he doing here ? ''"
"my grandfather says to me , refusing to look at emerson for another second ."
"`` he was just leaving , '' emerson replies , `` but you all have a good night ."
"happy birthday again , abby . ''"
"he leans over and gives me a kiss on the cheek , and i watch as my grandparents ' eyes bug out of their heads ."
"i 'm surprised they do n't keel over as he moves past them to the stairs and disappears from sight ."
"a long moment of silence unfolds as my grandparents stare at me , absolutely seething ."
"`` so ... do you guys want to come in , or- ? ''"
"i offer faintly ."
"`` abigail cecily rowan , '' my grandfather blusters , charging into the apartment with grandmother on his heels , `` how dare you subject us to that ? ''"
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"i reply , taken aback by his outrage ."
"i knew they would n't be happy to see deb 's son again after all these years , but they 're absolutely livid ."
"`` how could you blindside us like that ? ''"
"my grandmother asks , her nose wrinkled ."
"`` seeing that boy here , in our apartment- '' `` i thought this was my apartment , too , '' i cut in , `` i do live here , you know . ''"
"`` rent free , '' grandpa scoffs ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' i reply tersely , `` i did n't realize that meant i could n't have a friend over to celebrate my birthday ."
"should i clear all my guests with you , or- ? ''"
"`` a friend ? ''"
"grandma hisses , grabbing onto my wrist with surprising force for such an old lady ."
"`` do you think we 're absolute idiots ? ''"
"`` of course not ! ''"
"i exclaim , `` i do n't understand why you 're so upset about this . ''"
"`` you do n't understand why we 're upset to see you hanging out with that piece of trash ? ''"
"grandpa shouts , slamming his fist down on the kitchen counter ."
"`` your father told us all about finding you two in bed together the morning after the wedding ."
"it 's absolutely disgusting , abby ."
"you have no business fraternizing with someone of his kind-to say nothing of the fact that he was your stepbrother ! ''"
"`` you need to stop right there , '' i say firmly , yanking my arm out of my grandmother 's grasp ."
"`` you do n't know the first thing about emerson , or what happened between us when we were kids ."
"there was nothing disgusting about our relationship then , and there 's nothing wrong with us spending time together now !"
"he 's a wonderful man ."
"a smart , successful , funny man who i care very deeply about ."
"why ca n't you respect that ? ''"
"`` his trashy mother ruined your father 's life , '' grandma spits , `` she and her jailbird husband were sucking him dry that whole time ."
"and just look at him now !"
"he 's an absolute wreck ."
"he never recovered from what that woman did to him . ''"
"`` dad ruined his own life , '' i tell them , `` deb did a terrible thing , taking advantage of him like that ."
"but he 's a grown man ."
"no one forced him to relapse ."
"no one made him refuse to go to rehab and get his life together ."
"he let himself go to pieces ."
"and even if deb and her husband did set him off , that has nothing to do with emerson !"
"he and i were just kids when dad and deb got together ."
"we were innocent bystanders to that whole train wreck . ''"
"`` i do n't accept that , '' grandpa sniffs , crossing his arms , `` you ca n't possibly think that the son of two lowlifes could be anything but a piece of garbage himself ."
"the apple never falls far from the tree , dear . ''"
"`` no ? ''"
"i shoot back , `` well then what does that say about you , with everything dad 's been through ?"
"what does it say about me , when he 's such a wreck ?"
"terrible things can happen to good people , you know . ''"
"`` you 'd seriously have us believe that this emerson is a good person ? ''"
"grandma scoffs ."
"`` i would , '' i tell her , `` if you 'd just try and get to know him , you 'd see- '' `` this is ridiculous , '' grandpa mutters , shaking his head , `` i wo n't hear another second of it ."
"jillian , do n't bother taking off your coat ."
"we 're not staying . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"i say , `` i thought we were going to spend some time together ?"
"get something to eat , and- '' `` i 'm afraid i 've lost my appetite , '' grandpa says grimly ."
"`` just seeing that boy , being reminded of everything this family has gone through ... it 's too much ."
"i wo n't be subjected to this kind of nonsense ."
"especially not in an apartment i own myself ! ''"
"`` you must n't see that person again , abby , '' grandma says sternly ."
"i actually let out a laugh at this ."
"`` i must n't see him ? ''"
"i reply , cackling at the absurdity of what she 's said , `` well , that 's not really an option , seeing as we work together , now . ''"
"`` what ?"
"! ''"
"my grandparents gasp in unison ."
"`` i 've just been hired by the creative agency emerson works for , '' i inform them , `` i was going to tell you the good news over dinner , but ."
"well . ''"
"`` for christ 's sake , '' grandpa mutters , `` what are you giving him in return for getting you this job ?"
"do i even want to know ? ''"
"i stare at my grandfather , gobsmacked ."
"`` you think i got the job by ... what ?"
"sleeping with emerson ? ''"
"i ask quietly ."
"`` you think that little of me ?"
"of my abilities ?"
"i ... i do n't even know what to say , grandpa . ''"
"`` say that you wo n't get involved with that man outside of work , '' grandma pleads , `` especially not here , under our roof . ''"
"`` if you 're so concerned with emerson not being under your roof , maybe i 'd better move , '' i say , exasperated ."
"`` if that 's what you want , '' grandpa says coldly , `` you can carry on with that man all you like , but you 'd best not expect to have anything to do with us if you choose to do so ."
"if you keep on with your disgraceful little relationship with him , i 'm afraid we wo n't be able to continue being a part of your life , abby ."
"you 'll have to leave this apartment , of course ."
"and be content with never seeing us again ."
"if you can live with all that , go ahead . ''"
"`` you 'd cut me out of your lives ? ''"
"i ask quietly , `` just for being with emerson ? ''"
"`` we would , '' my grandfather assures me ."
"`` we 'd have no other choice , '' my grandmother agrees with him ."
"there 's a hint of sadness in her voice , but she 's always gone along with what grandpa decides ."
"`` well ... '' i say , my voice hollow , `` you certainly have given me a lot to think about this evening ."
"and would you look at that , my appetite seems to be gone , too . ''"
"`` why do n't you just call us when you 've come to your senses , '' grandpa says , heading for the door , `` or at least call to let us know if we need to start looking for a new tenant ."
"you have a couple of days to decide ."
"if we do n't hear from you , we 'll assume you 've made your decision and act accordingly . ''"
"`` i do n't care what you decide to do about the apartment , '' i tell him , `` i 'm more than happy to find a new place to live , i can pay rent now that my job is lined up ."
"but cutting me out of your lives altogether ?"
"that 's what hurts ."
"how can you be so mad at me , just for spending time with someone i care about ? ''"
"`` we are n't mad at you , abby , '' grandma says , following him out , `` we 're just terribly , terribly disappointed . ''"
"`` yeah ."
"i know the feeling , '' i whisper , wrapping my arms around my waist ."
"they march off into the elevator , and i slam the door in their wake ."
"hot , angry tears course down my cheeks as i press my back to the door ."
"how dare they say those horrible things about emerson ?"
"they do n't even know him ."
"and how could they threaten to cut me out of their lives , just for being with him ?"
"i ca n't believe they 'd disown their only granddaughter over something so petty as a grudge ."
"especially when that grudge is built on nothing but bullshit !"
"the injustice of it all has me reeling ."
"i feel the room spinning around me , and i know it 's not just the booze that 's knocking me off kilter ."
"if my grandparents turn their backs on me , i 'll be officially without any family in this world ."
"i have n't really spoken to my dad for years , i have no aunts and uncles , no cousins ."
"frank and jillian are it ."
"and they 're ready to abandon me if i keep emerson in my life ."
"i stagger over to the couch , curling up into a ball and letting the tears come hard and fast ."
"the very thought of losing what 's left of my family has me feeling unmoored , alone ."
"it 's not just having to find a new place to live that scares me , i can take care of that in no time ."
"it 's the idea of losing my history , my only real links back to my mother , my old life , that terrifies me the most ."
"`` what ... '' i mutter , as i feel something dig into my hip ."
"i reach into my pocket and feel my fingers close around the ring box emerson brought over tonight ."
"i blink away my tears and open the box once more , staring down at the beautiful pearl ring ."
"with trembling fingers , i carefully pluck the ring out of its cushioned bed and slip it onto my right hand ."
"it fits perfectly ."
"after all these years , i still love it ."
"and if i 'm being honest , i still love the person who gave it to me , too ."
"daringly , i slide the ring off and slip it , breathlessly , onto the other hand ."
"i look down at the single pearl , glimmering on my left ring finger ."
"i have to say , i like the look of it there ."
"in that moment , i know that i ca n't cut emerson out of my life ."
"not again , no matter what it costs me in the end , he 's worth whatever price i have to pay ."
"chapter fifteen i spend most of sunday recovering from my less-than-ideal birthday ."
"but before i know it , monday morning has arrived ; my first day on the job at bastian creative ."
"my stomach is in knots as i get ready for the day ."
"i was already nervous to begin my dream job , but this weekend only ramped up the pressure ."
"with my cushy free housing likely to be yanked away , i need this first week at bastian to go incredibly well ."
"there 's sure to be a bit of a probation period where cooper can let me go if i do n't fit in at bastian ."
"so i guess my only choice is to be the model employee , even with my one-day stepbrother and potential lover training me ."
"sure ."
"no problem ."
"speaking of emerson , he did n't even try to get in touch with me after our roller coaster of a saturday night ."
"between our steamy make out session , our tussle over money issues , and my grandparents ' atrocious behavior , i 'm not really sure where we stand ."
"and now , we 're going to spend this entire week in each others ' company as i learn the ropes of my new job ."
"this should be interesting , that 's for sure ."
"i arrive at the bastian offices right on time , dressed in my best `` professional hipster '' office attire ."
"but as i step out of the elevator , ready to dive into my training , i 'm surprised to find myself alone in the communal workroom ."
"of the dozen or so other employees , no one else seems to be around ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"i call , glancing around in search of my coworkers ."
"i check my phone and see that it is , indeed , 10 a.m ."
"the start of the workday ."
"what gives ?"
"for something to do , i head on over to the well-stocked bar and snack cart , where a fancy , gleaming espresso machine stands at the ready ."
"as i set to work crafting myself an excellent cup of coffee , i hear footsteps behind me ."
"spinning around , i find myself face-to-face with the man i 've been thinking of incessantly for the past two days ."
"`` oh abby , you should n't have ! ''"
"emerson teases , eyeing my espresso , `` it 's not your job to make me coffee in the morning . ''"
"`` how convenient ! ''"
"i chirp , playing along with his bit as i grab my mug , `` because this sucker is all mine . ''"
"`` i 'll just have to join you , then , '' emerson smiles , stepping around me to get at the espresso machine ."
"`` unless we 're still doing that not-talking thing that i hate so much . ''"
"`` not at all , '' i reply , my heart thumping wildly in my chest ."
"and not from the caffeine , either ."
"`` provided that you do n't hate me after saturday night . ''"
"`` please , '' emerson laughs , `` i 've long since stopped caring about what people think of me , abby ."
"and i certainly do n't make a habit of holding peoples ' families against them ."
"i 'm sorry that i said those shitty things about your grandparents ."
"it 's not my place to judge them , even if they have no problem at all judging me . ''"
"`` man ."
"how 's the weather up there on the high road ? ''"
"i laugh , sipping my coffee ."
"`` what can i say ?"
"that charming temper of mine is n't quite as hot as it was eight years ago , '' he replies , picking up his own mug of joe ."
"`` turns out that punching people is frowned upon in the tech industry ."
"who knew ?"
"so , what do you say ?"
"are we all right ? ''"
"`` we 're all right , '' i smile back ."
"`` i see you like your present , '' he observes , looking down at my right hand ."
"`` oh yeah , '' i reply , admiring the silver ring once again ."
"thank god i remembered to put it back on the right hand , rather than the left ."
"`` it 's beautiful , emerson . ''"
"`` i 'm glad you still think so , after all this time , '' he says , `` still the same old abby , huh ? ''"
"`` more or less , '' i shrug , `` though i seem to be more obnoxiously punctual these days ."
"where is everyone ? ''"
"`` oh , cooper does n't usually roll in until noon or so , and the rest of the office has taken to his schedule , '' emerson tells me ."
"`` jeez , '' i say , `` just when i was thinking this job could n't get any better ... '' `` it 's a pretty sweet gig , '' emerson agrees , `` we work hard , but on our own terms ."
"i 've never been happier with any other company i 've worked for ."
"i figured i 'd get here early to meet you today , show you the ropes before everyone gets here ."
"ready to start , protege ? ''"
"`` all set , '' i say , draining the rest of my coffee , `` teach me your ways , o ' wise one . ''"
"the rest of the day unfolds before us as emerson walks me through all the ins and outs of the agency ."
"my job will mostly consist of brainstorming new ideas for marketing and branding before passing them along to different clients ."
"i 'll get to execute my ideas using bastian 's top-of-the-line design suite , too ."
"i never thought that i 'd get to have a job that i actually like , especially not this early on in my career ."
"between the new gig at bastian and emerson happening back into my life , 26 is shaping up to be a fine year , indeed ... that is , as long as i do n't think of the whole grandparents-disowning-me-thing ."
"emerson and i are sitting together at one end of the communal desk as our coworkers begin to arrive a couple hours later ."
"everyone greets me in a cordial , if not chipper , way ."
"but hey , we 're all millennials , that 's how we roll ."
"i 'd rather they be real with me than overly enthusiastic ."
"i recognize a few people-bradley , tyler , and emily-from the other night at the bar ."
"they all smile politely at me as they settle down to work , but i can feel their eyes darting back and forth between emerson and me ."
"i 'm sure they 're wondering what we were doing at the bar together , what the nature of our relationship is , all that ."
"i almost laugh , thinking about how i 'd explain our relationship these days : `` oh , you know , we were step-siblings for a day , slept together once , have n't seen each other in ten years , but yeah-it 's totally chill ! ''"
"i decide not to worry about what anyone else might be thinking and focus on learning the ropes ."
"by the end of my first day , i feel like i 'm starting to have an idea of all that the job will entail , and i 'm more excited than ever to keep learning more ."
"it turns out , emerson is a great teacher ."
"cooper does n't roll into until after noon , just like emerson said ."
"he smiles around at his worker bees , and comes over to say hello to me and emerson ."
"`` how 's your first day so far , abby ? ''"
"he asks jovially ."
"`` i have n't broken anything yet , '' i reply , `` so i guess it 's all good ! ''"
"`` she 's a natural at this , '' emerson tells cooper ."
"out of the corner of my eye , i see tyler nudge bradley and shoot him a knowing look ."
"i should remind emerson not to praise me too vocally around the others ."
"it might get people talking about us ."
"maybe even feeling a little jealous of my friendly relationship with one of the agency 's higher-ups ."
"my grandfather 's quip about what i might have done with emerson to get this job still stings ."
"i do n't want anyone here getting the same idea ."
"though glancing around the communal workstation , it looks like it might be too late for that ."
"i feel myself growing quiet as the day wears on , self-conscious of what my coworkers might be saying about my rather cozy relationship with the head of the company 's european branch ."
"by the time we all start to clock out and head home once more , my jaw may as well be wired shut ."
"my growing silence is n't lost on emerson , either ."
"`` i know it 's a lot to take in all at once , '' he says , as we step into the elevator together with a few other coworkers , `` but you really are doing a great job ."
"you 're going to do so well here , abby ."
"i 'm proud of you . ''"
"i bite my tongue until we reach the ground floor ."
"as the other bastian employees head off in their own directions , emerson and i fall into step with each other out on the sidewalk ."
"i feel like i can breathe again for the first time in hours ."
"never underestimate the stifling nature of coworkers ' judgey passive aggression ."
"`` how does it not bother you that people are clearly gossiping about us in there ? ''"
"i ask emerson , as we head for the subway ."
"`` what are you talking about ? ''"
"he asks , cocking an eyebrow at me ."
"`` our coworkers , '' i spell it out , `` they obviously know that something 's up between us . ''"
"`` well , something is up , is n't it ? ''"
"he asks , slipping an arm around my waist in his mischievous fashion ."
"`` seriously emerson , '' i say , drawing to a stop beside the subway entrance , `` are n't you worried that this could mess things up for us at work ? ''"
"`` no , '' he says shortly , looking a bit irked ."
"`` i 'm not worried about being fodder for the rumor mill for a week or two ."
"this is n't high school , ab ."
"gossip ca n't hurt you . ''"
"`` it could be a bigger deal than that , '' i reply anxiously , `` i mean , what if cooper does n't approve of us ... being whatever we are ? ''"
"`` how can he disapprove of 'whatever we are ' if we have n't even decided what we are yet ? ''"
"emerson counters ."
"`` oof ."
"this is making my head hurt , '' i laugh , the tension of the day dispelling now that we 're out of the office ."
"`` bet i have the cure for what ails you , '' he replies , taking my hand in his and tugging me down the block ."
"`` that 's my train , '' i inform him , glancing back at the subway ."
"`` i know , '' he says , `` but my apartment is this way . ''"
"`` are you inviting me over ? ''"
"i ask , trailing along behind him ."
"`` obviously , '' he laughs ."
"`` what ... for ? ''"
"i ask , digging my heels in ever-so-slightly ."
"`` in case you 've forgotten , i 'm a pretty decent cook , '' he replies , `` let me make you dinner ."
"we can call it a belated double-birthday celebration , since our other attempts at celebrating got ... derailed this weekend . ''"
"dinner at emerson 's apartment ?"
"that sounds an awful lot like a romantic evening to me ."
"and though i know it would be wise to take this whole thing slow , i just ca n't resist him tonight ."
"who am i kidding-when have i ever been able to resist emerson sawyer ?"
"`` ok , '' i smile , `` lead on , iron chef . ''"
"we swing by a fancy high-end grocery store on the way to emerson 's apartment so he can gather his ingredients ."
"i ca n't help but smile wistfully as i think of the last time he cooked for me ."
"there was so much sweetness and sorrow wrapped up in those few fleeting weeks of our younger years that any thought of them is bursting with remembered sensation ."
"of course , it 's not like this reunion of ours has been without its emotional moments ."
"`` here we are , '' emerson says , drawing to a stop on a gorgeous block lined with cozy cafes and classy boutiques ."
"he leads me up a set of stone steps and unlocks a door there ."
"`` this is where you live ? ''"
"i breathe , glancing over my shoulder at the cosmopolitan block ."
"`` sure is , '' he says , holding the door for me ."
"i expect to walk into the lobby of an apartment building , a ground floor leading off to a bunch of different units ."
"but as emerson nudges open a second door and steps through , i feel my jaw drop ."
"the entire space inside is an open , spacious loft ."
"this entire building is his ."
"i 've watched enough house-hunting reality tv to know that this is easily a multi-million dollar property-and this is n't even his only place !"
"the impossibly high ceilings vault above a perfectly-arranged interior ."
"there 's a huge , sparkling kitchen , a sunken living room , and an enclosed bedroom off the main space ."
"huge , towering windows take up the entire wall opposite us , and lead off onto a private terrace ."
"the design is mostly minimal-white walls and hardwood floors-with purposeful touches of natural materials like wood and stone ."
"the appliances and decor are an artful mix of new and vintage ."
"emerson 's home is utterly perfect ."
"it could have been ripped right off my `` dream home '' pinterest page ."
"amazing how our tastes are so aligned , even though we come from totally different backgrounds and have led completely different lives ."
"i 'd call that a good sign ."
"i gasp as a throw pillow comes barreling my way , only to realize in the next moment that the galloping bundle of white fluff is actually an adorable little west highland terrier ."
"the tiny dog collides with my legs , tail wagging a million miles an hour ."
"`` you must be roxie , '' i laugh , reaching down to scratch her ears ."
"`` yep ."
"that 's the lady of the house , '' emerson smiles ."
"`` house ? ''"
"i shoot back , kneeling down to get a better look at the friendly westie ."
"`` more like palace . ''"
"`` pick your jaw up off the floor and tell me what kind of wine you like , '' he laughs , setting the groceries down on the kitchen island ."
"`` something red , '' i say , staring in wonder at the impeccable space ."
"`` coming right up , '' he replies , opening a concealed miniature wine cellar nestled into the island ."
"`` how does a nice rioja sound ? ''"
"`` it sounds ... nice , '' i tell him , settling down at one of the wooden stools before the counter ."
"roxie follows me over into the kitchen and sits at my feet , staring up at me with amiable , adorable curiosity ."
"`` she likes you , '' emerson observes , pausing to give roxie a good nuzzling ."
"`` well ."
"she has wonderful taste , '' i kid , flipping my blonde hair theatrically ."
"he produces a couple of wine glasses and pours generously ."
"`` to our 26th years , '' he smiles , clinking my glass ."
"`` to you not doing too shabbily for yourself , '' i reply , taking a sip of the delicious wine ."
"`` i mean , you told me how well you 've made out with this app development gig , but holy crap ."
"this loft , emerson ... '' `` i 'm glad you like it , '' he says , gathering and prepping his ingredients ."
"`` i actually prefer it to my place in london , to tell you the truth ."
"but that 's where cooper decided he needs me most , so . ''"
"it takes a second for emerson 's words to click ."
"of course ."
"he 's not even based here at the new york offices of bastian ."
"he runs the show in europe ."
"that means , of course , that he 's probably due back there soon ."
"like , the end of the week soon ."
"why did n't i think of that before ?"
"`` you ok ? ''"
"he asks , heating up some olive oil in a cast iron skillet ."
"`` oh ."
"yeah , '' i say , snapping back to attention ."
"`` i just ... kind of forgot that this is a temporary situation ."
"you being in new york . ''"
"`` mmm , '' he mutters , noncommittally , `` it 's true , i did only swing by to train the new recruit at cooper 's request ."
"if i could have known that you were the new recruit , well ... '' `` well what ? ''"
"i ask , leaning my elbows on the island ."
"he glances over his shoulder at me , smiling ."
"`` maybe i would n't have bought a return ticket , in the end . ''"
"i 'm torn between elation and trepidation ."
"best not force the issue of what 's going to happen between us once my training is complete and focus on the moment at hand ."
"i watch as emerson grills two delectable salmon fillets , blanches some broccoli rabe , and prepares a small batch of pesto pasta ."
"the food smells amazing , the wine is fantastic , and i 'm here with one of my favorite people on earth ."
"today may have been a little bit rough , but it sure is shaping up nicely ."
"if i try real hard , i can pretend that this is what my life is like every day , and forget that this is just a fleeting anomaly ."
"`` here we go , '' emerson says proudly , plating our food and nodding toward the terrace ."
"`` shall we ? ''"
"i follow him out onto the secluded patio with roxie right on my heels ."
"we settle down at a little table beneath a canopy of string lights and overgrown ivy ."
"i know i should n't get attached to this place , this feeling , but i ca n't help it ."
"this is all so ... perfect ."
"and that 's even before i taste the food ."
"`` oh my god ... '' i murmur , taking my first bite of perfectly grilled salmon ."
"`` better than my risotto , even ? ''"
"emerson asks , helping himself to his meal ."
"`` i never would have thought it possible but , yes , '' i exclaim , savoring the taste ."
"`` i kept up with the hobby , '' he says modestly , `` spending a bit of time in france certainly whipped my cooking skills into shape . ''"
"`` you lived in france ? ''"
"i ask , wide-eyed ."
"`` oh yeah , '' he nods , `` france , england , spain , even finland for a while . ''"
"`` damn , '' i whistle , `` i 've been in the same apartment since i was eighteen . ''"
"`` nothing wrong with having roots , '' he replies ."
"`` yeah ... '' i murmur , thinking of my grandparents ' threat to tear those roots right out from under me ."
"we savor our incredible meal , the fine wine , each other 's company-and of course the delightful presence of roxie ."
"it 's shaping up to be a pretty good first day at the new job after all , even if this is strictly extra-curricular ."
"the evening wears on , a couple more glasses of wine are poured , and emerson even manages to find a record we can both agree on-iron and wine , an old favorite of ours ."
"we retire back into the loft , and i meander about the space at my leisure , taking in all the little details that make his house a home ."
"`` i 'd offer you a grand tour , '' emerson says , watching me from the center of the room , `` but this is pretty much it . ''"
"`` what about in there ? ''"
"i ask , nodding toward the bedroom door ."
"`` you trying to get a peek at my bedroom , rowan ? ''"
"he asks , grinning ."
"`` maybe i am , sawyer , '' i shrug , `` unless you 're afraid of me finding your playboy stash or something . ''"
"`` this from the girl who kept a vibrator within arm 's length through her entire adolescence , '' he laughs , walking toward his room ."
"`` i have needs , ok ? ''"
"i exclaim , feigning defensiveness ."
"`` is that so ? ''"
"he replies , his voice going raspy around the edges as he pauses in the doorway of his bedroom ."
"the delicious wine has lowered both of our inhibitions , and my body comes alive as i feel us transitioning into the more ... sensual part of the evening ."
"we have n't mentioned our steamy kiss from this weekend , yet , but we seem to be coming back around to right where we left off ."
"emerson 's blue eyes flash with desire as i step up to him , resting a hand on the firm panes of his chest ."
"`` you know about my needs better than anyone , '' i say softly , trailing my fingers down his cut , defined torso ."
"`` mmm ."
"we 'll just have to see what we can do about them , then , '' he murmurs , catching my wrist ."
"my eyes go wide as he draws my hand to his full lips and takes the tip of my finger into his mouth ."
"i feel his tongue brush against my fingertip , remember what it felt like to feel his mouth other places ... and break off into his room , chest pounding ."
"it 's a small , simple space with high ceilings and a huge king bed front and center ."
"a sleek dresser and wide window round out the space , and a few well-placed keepsakes make it feel like a sacred space ."
"i trail my fingers along the dresser , setting down my drained glass of wine ."
"i 'm just on the far edge of tipsy , and my cares are swirling away by the second ."
"there are a few framed pictures on the dresser , and my stomach turns to see an old wedding photo ."
"it is n't of our parents ' ridiculous ceremony , of course , but i do recognize a much-younger deb ."
"this must be from her first wedding to emerson 's father , a man who looks remarkably like the one standing next to me now ."
"deb looks so happy ."
"healthy , even ."
"it breaks my heart to think of what her life has become ."
"i tear my eyes away from the old picture and notice that a second frame holds not a photograph , but a drawing ."
"it only takes a split second for me to recognize it , and as soon as i do , i feel my hand fly to my lips ."
"there , on emerson 's dresser , is the sketch of him i drew when we were kids , the one i gave to him on his eighteenth birthday ."
"the drawing features him in half-profile , looking serious and sure ."
"i worked on this piece for hours-days , even-before giving it to him in that seaside motel room ."
"it 's been preserved perfectly , lovingly , and for a spell i 'm too moved to speak ."
"two strong arms wrap around my waist from behind as i stare at the picture of teenage emerson , drawn by my very own hand ."
"i clasp his hands where they rest against my body , letting my head lean back against his chest ."
"`` you kept it , '' i whisper , turning my face toward his ."
"`` of course , '' he murmurs , resting his cheek against the top of my head ."
"`` that picture has traveled the world with me ."
"i 've kept it in every home i 've ever lived in , from my little apartment in philly to my flat in london ."
"every time i get to thinking that i do n't deserve my success , that i 'm just some punk kid who 's pulling one over on the rest of the world , i just look at this picture ."
"it 's always reminded me that there 's someone in the world who thinks i 'm strong , and worthy ."
"someone who loved me , once . ''"
"`` loves you , '' i whisper , turning to face him , `` not loved ."
"loves ."
"present tense . ''"
"`` i thought i was supposed to be the teacher this week , '' he murmurs , running his hands down the sides of my body ."
"`` what are you doing giving me a grammar lesson ? ''"
"`` oh , i think we both still have plenty to teach each other , emerson , '' i say , taking his scruffy , sculpted face in my hands ."
"`` you mean it , then ? ''"
"he asks , grabbing hold of my slender hips ."
"`` you ... you still ... ? ''"
"`` i love you , emerson , '' i whisper , letting those blue eyes swallow me whole ."
"`` i always have ."
"i always will . ''"
"`` thank god , '' he grins , pulling me to him , `` 'unrequited ' is n't a good shade on me . ''"
"`` you mean ... '' i breathe ."
"`` i love you too , abby , '' he says , `` but right now , i need you too much to waste another second talking about it . ''"
"`` fine by me , '' i murmur ."
"i throw my arms around emerson 's shoulders as he brings his lips to mine ."
"he scoops me up into his arms as his powerful jaw works my mouth wide open ."
"i clasp my ankles around his tapered waist , and he bears my weight as if it were nothing ."
"his tongue glides against mine , caressing it , as he spins me around in the air , laying me out flat across his king bed ."
"he lowers his staggering body to mine , encompassing me , subsuming me ."
"i can feel his every muscle ripple as we move together , a tangle of limbs and lust ."
"i bury my fingers in his hair , letting my tongue sweep against his as his hands roam down the length of my body ."
"he tastes exactly the same , beneath the fine red wine ."
"but while our bodies find the same easy syncopation we 've always known , there 's more sureness and grace in our motion ."
"emerson was all raw power at eighteen , but now ?"
"he 's totally comfortable in his body , assured and knowledgeable ."
"his every muscle is a tightly coiled spring of power and finesse ."
"i 've been craving his touch for eight years , but i never could have guessed how good it could possibly feel to have it again ."
"there 's no preciousness in our desire , now ."
"no need for things to be right or perfect ."
"we just need each other , in the rawest , most carnal way ."
"we tear at each other 's clothing , ripping off layers and tossing them across the room ."
"i rake my nails across the firm planes of his body-his rippling back , his impossibly cut torso-as he grabs hold of whatever part of me he can ."
"in a matter of minutes , our naked bodies are pressed together on his king bed , our skin flushed with want , our mouths insatiable ."
"`` i almost forgot this , '' i whisper , tracing the outline of his sparrow tattoo as he kneels above me ."
"his cock is rock hard , throbbing at its full , massive best ."
"i bring my hands eagerly to that pulsating length , shivering with delight as i wrap my fingers around his shaft ."
"his eyes close as i work my hands along the full stretch of him , my thumbs tracing along the ridge of his swollen head ."
"`` almost forgot this , too , '' i grin ."
"`` yeah ? ''"
"he growls , catching my wrists and pinning them over my head , `` well , let me remind you of a few other things , while we 're at it . ''"
"his eyes rake down along the length of my naked body ."
"my back arches as if his very gaze is caressing me ."
"i let my knees fall open as he brings his lips to the hollow of my throat , leaving searing kisses all along my skin ."
"he lowers himself to me as he moves his mouth over my body , letting me feel the tip of him brush against my wet slit ."
"`` you 're so ready for me , '' he growls , pressing his cock forward by just a hair as he kneads my tits with capable hands ."
"he pinches my nipples just hard enough , and i cry out as the first thundering shockwave of pleasure runs through me ."
"`` christ , '' i breathe , my eyes wide with wonder , `` you know exactly how to touch me . ''"
"in reply , he lowers his lips to my nipple ."
"keeping his eyes on mine , he takes that hard peak into his mouth , rubbing against it with the tip of his tongue ."
"i gasp as his fingers skirt down my lean torso and find my wet , aching sex ."
"sucking and biting at my tits , he traces his fingers along the slick length of me , working farther into me with every pass before he finally , gloriously , lays two strong fingers against my hard , throbbing clit ."
"my head falls back against the pillows as he bites my nipple , tracing firm , quick circles over that tender nub between my legs ."
"i grab onto huge handfuls of bedding , forcing myself to breathe as he rolls his fingers over my clit , faster and harder with every moment ."
"my knees begin to tremble as i dig my nails into his back , holding on for dear life ."
"`` right there , '' i moan , as he flicks and kneads that pulsing bundle ."
"`` god , that 's good . ''"
"`` you think that 's good ? ''"
"he growls , catching a handful of my blonde hair in his hand and turning me to face him ."
"the sudden jolt of force coupled with his expert touch between my legs nearly makes me come right then and there ."
"`` just wait ... '' he gives me a swift , hard kiss , working my jaw open and letting his tongue sweep deeply into my mouth ."
"i wrap my arms around his neck , shuddering on the edge of orgasm as he bears down on my clit ."
"`` i 'm so close , '' i whisper ."
"`` how close ? ''"
"he growls in my ear , forcing my knees further apart with his ."
"`` so ... so ... '' i gasp , my eyes screwing up in bliss ."
"i teeter on the edge , ready to tumble ."
"but the room spins around as emerson grabs hold of my hips , flips me roughly onto my stomach ."
"shock and illicit delight confound me as i look back at him over my shoulder ."
"there 's a savage hunger burning in his blue eyes as he kneels over me from behind , letting me feel his enormous cock against the tight , forbidden circle of my ass ."
"for just a moment , i think i know where we 're headed , but again he surprises me ."
"pulling me forcefully onto my hands and knees , emerson runs his fingers into the firm rise of my ass ."
"i arch my back , knowing how much he loves to drink in the sight of me wild with needing him ."
"with a low , guttural growl , he tugs me back toward him , lowering his mouth to my sex ."
"my mouth falls open in amazement as he pushes against my flesh , parting me before him from behind ."
"the illicit thrill is almost too much , which makes it just enough to drive me absolutely crazy ."
"i savor the sensation of his tongue tracing all along my slit , licking me from behind ."
"the very next moment , i feel the tip of his tongue against my raw , tender clit ."
"i buck against him as he has his fill of me , licking up every drop of my desire as he works that hard button ."
"i barrel toward the edge of bliss , blinded by the force of it ."
"my screams echo around the small room as emerson wraps his lips around my clit and gives it one last forceful suck ."
"i 'm done for ."
"with an elated scream , i come hard into his waiting mouth ."
"my limbs shudder with the force of the orgasm that rolls wildly through me , lighting up every nerve ending with unprecedented sensation ."
"emerson drinks me up , unable to get enough , until i 'm absolutely spent ."
"i turn to look back at him , dizzy and amazed ."
"in the throbbing aftermath of my bliss , i can only think of one thing ."
"`` i need you to fuck me , emerson , '' i breathe , on my hands and knees before him ."
"`` i need to feel you inside of me ."
"now . ''"
"`` as if i could wait another second , '' he growls , taking my face in his and kissing me deeply ."
"i can taste myself on his tongue , and shudder with delighted anticipation ."
"with his mouth on mine , he lifts my body and presses me hard against his wooden headboard ."
"i grab on tight as he moves behind me , flattening me against the sturdy surface ."
"there 's just enough time for me to take a breath as he produces a condom from the bedside table , tears the package open with his teeth , and rolls it down his throbbing shaft ."
"i brace myself , lifting my ass to emerson as i feel him poised behind me , his hard chest heaving with anticipation ."
"our voices rise together in a soaring moan as emerson drives his cock into my waiting , eager body ."
"my fingers dig into the headboard as he splits me open , slamming into the very core of me ."
"i 've never felt him this way before , never dreamed anyone could reach me so deeply , so fully ."
"i press myself back into his every thrust , taking him in as far as i can ."
"my head falls back between my shoulders as emerson pounds into me , his fingers digging into my hips and his thumb pressing around my ass-the feeling so intensely illicit it drives me crazy ."
"with every pass , i feel more of him ."
"i swear , he grows harder by the second as i cling to the headboard , dashing myself against him with all my might ."
"his grasp tightens as he careens toward the edge himself ."
"i bear down as his pace becomes quicker , his bucking hips more intent ."
"i know he 's about to lose it ."
"`` come , '' i gasp , turning to meet his gleaming blue eyes ."
"`` i want you to- '' he rears back and drives into me with one last , breathtaking thrust ."
"we cry out in unison as he erupts inside of me ."
"our bodies are run through with sweeping sensation , and we ride the crashing wave together ."
"we peak and collapse together , folding into one tangle of spent limbs ."
"our chests rise and fall like mad as i curl into emerson 's muscular side ."
"he pulls me close , enclosing me in his arms as our breathing slowly evens out ."
"the record finally ends as we lay in emerson 's bed together ."
"in the warm , easy silence , we finally swim back to the surface of reality , gazing at each other in the half light ."
"`` i ca n't believe i went nearly a decade without this , '' i laugh softly , running a hand through his closely cropped brown hair ."
"`` me either , '' he grins , kissing my palm , `` let 's not do that again , ok ?"
"the being-apart thing , i mean . ''"
"`` sounds good to me , '' i sigh happily , resting my cheek against his chest ."
"`` i could n't stand to lose this again . ''"
"`` you wo n't , '' he says , his voice taking on a serious cast ."
"`` whatever happens , abby , i wo n't let anything ruin this . ''"
"as the world reforms around us , the nagging intrusions of the real world creep back into my mind ."
"i want to believe that nothing can derail us now , that we 're home free ."
"but what about my family ?"
"our parents ?"
"our history ?"
"what about our careers , and that fact that we live on different continents ?"
"but as emerson kisses away the worried crease between my eyebrows , all those unknown factors fade away ."
"it 's only him and me , now ."
"alone in this beautiful soho apartment with another bottle of wine just waiting to be opened and a little bundle of white fur leaping up onto the bed to cuddle at our feet ."
"i wonder if this is what things would have been like if we had n't been separated all those years ago ."
"would we have been able to continue on as a pair and wind up here eventually ?"
"or did we need to be apart for that time , grow into our own selves before we could be together ?"
"it 's impossible to know , of course ."
"but still , it 's a comfort to think that all the pain we 've been through , separately and together , has n't been in vain ."
"that our whole lives have been leading up to something wonderful that we now get to share ."
"`` come on , '' emerson says , easing my up from bed and handing me my top , `` we have n't even had dessert yet . ''"
"`` you 're perfect , you know that ? ''"
"i sigh , slipping back into my clothes ."
"`` yeah ."
"i know , '' he teases , leaning in for another kiss ."
"we head back out into the loft half-dressed , open up a bottle of pinot grigio , and dig into a couple pints of ice cream-tahitian mint for me , black cherry for him ."
"settling down onto the expansive , pillowy couch , we talk late into the night , halfway paying attention to some mushy rom-com that 's playing on tv as we revel in playing house together ."
"i hardly even notice as i start drifting off into a sated , happy sleep ."
"my appetites-all of them-have never felt so satisfied as they do tonight ."
"chapter sixteen sloppy kisses land all over my sleeping face , dragging me out of slumber ."
"man , has emerson lost his smooching prowess already ?"
"i think to myself , prying my eyes open ."
"but as i blink into the morning sunlight , it is n't emerson 's blue eyes i find staring back at me , but roxie 's chocolate brown peepers ."
"i laugh , giving her a good scratch behind the ears and pulling myself to sitting ."
"i 've fallen asleep on the couch with my head in emerson 's lap ."
"he 's still out , and i help myself to a moment of watching him sleep ."
"his features are soft and relaxed , as gorgeous as ever ."
"i ca n't believe i have the privilege of seeing him this way again ."
"swinging my legs over the couch , delicately so as not to wake him , i reach into my purse and grab for my phone ."
"i blink down at the welcome screen and see a dozen texts from riley , asking where i am ."
"there are missed calls , too , a good handful ."
"and not just from riley , either ."
"the bastian offices seem to have called my phone , more than a few times ."
"at first , i ca n't imagine why ."
"that is , until i see what time it is ."
"`` fuck ! ''"
"i cry out , tumbling off the couch ."
"`` huh ?"
"what ? ''"
"emerson mumbles , snapping out of his slumber and looking wildly around ."
"`` what 's the matter ? ''"
"`` it 's twelve thirty already ! ''"
"i tell him , scrambling to my feet in a panic ."
"`` we 're supposed to be at work !"
"how the hell did we oversleep ? ''"
"`` guess we wore each other out last night , huh ? ''"
"emerson smiles , reaching for me ."
"`` do n't , '' i snap , tearing off in search of my clothes ."
"`` we 're going to be an hour late to work , emerson ."
"and it 's only my second day . ''"
"`` relax , '' he says , following me into the bedroom , `` i 'll vouch for you . ''"
"`` oh , yeah ."
"that 'll look awesome , '' i shoot back ."
"`` me strolling in on my superior 's arm , getting special treatment because i happen to be fucking the right person . ''"
"`` whoa , slow down , '' he says , `` first of all , i did n't mean to offend you , i just do n't think this is as big a deal as you 're making it out to be ."
"cooper does n't even show up until noon , remember ?"
"and secondly , i did n't realize we were just 'fucking ' , here . ''"
"`` we 're not-i 'm just- '' i stammer , shoving my hands through my hair ."
"`` i 've been dreaming about a job like this for months ."
"years ."
"and now , when i finally get my foot in the door , i fuck it up immediately ."
"god , i do n't even have any fresh clothes to wear !"
"i 'm going to have to show up in the same thing i wore yesterday , and everyone 's going to know that we- '' `` here , '' emerson says , reaching into his wallet and withdrawing a credit card ."
"`` take this ."
"go to the shop downstairs and buy something new ."
"we 'll head right over to the office . ''"
"`` i ca n't take your card , '' i say , gaping at him ."
"`` it 's ... it 's yours . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"he shrugs , `` it 's partially my fault we overslept ."
"let me help fix it . ''"
"`` but- '' `` go , '' he insists , pressing the card into my palm , `` i 'll get dressed and meet you . ''"
"reeling , i gather my things and trundle out of emerson 's loft onto the soho street ."
"there 's a tiny boutique downstairs , chock full of incredible items ."
"the shop girl raises an eyebrow as i barrel in , but forgets her troubles when i hand her the surprisingly heavy credit card ."
"in no time flat , she has me styled in a combination of new and vintage pieces ."
"emerson appears as i 'm being rung up , impressed by my sleek black jeans , silky yellow blouse , and grungy studded jacket ."
"i nearly faint as i see what this outfit is going to cost , but emerson does n't even bat an eye as his card is charged ."
"i still ca n't get used to the idea that money is no issue for him ."
"and i definitely do n't know how to feel about using his money for myself ."
"but no time to debate the issue now , we 've got to book it ."
"we set off for our office , which is thankfully located in the same neighborhood as emerson 's apartment ."
"but still , by the time we step into the elevators , it 's one in the afternoon ."
"i bounce on the balls of my feet as the elevator lifts us up to the offices , feeling anxious and guilty ."
"`` take a breath , abby , '' emerson tells me , as we draw level with our floor ."
"`` i 'm sure no one 's even going to notice that we're- '' as the doors slide open , i feel the breath catch in my throat ."
"a dozen faces whip around in unison as the entire office turns to stare at us ."
"every face at the communal desk stares at me and emerson unabashedly as we step onto the floor side-by-side ."
"i can feel my cheeks burning as my co-workers ' gazes go from curious to smug ."
"i 'm sure they all spent the entire morning wondering if emerson and i were together , and now their suspicions have been confirmed ."
"`` cooper asked to see you both as soon as you got in today , '' says emily , one of the people who saw me and emerson at that bar together ."
"the corners of her mouth are turned up in a grin that 's starving for scandal ."
"`` thanks , '' emerson says curtly , drawing himself up to his full height ."
"he has no reason to be cowed by our co-workers ' scrutiny ."
"he has seniority ."
"and a billion-dollar bank account ."
"i , on the other hand , am absolutely leveled ."
"i ca n't believe i 've let myself become a joke within my first forty-eight hours here ."
"`` nice duds , '' mutters tyler , scoping out my outfit as emerson and i hurry past the desk toward cooper 's office ."
"`` that 's what a sugar daddy will get you , '' bradley stage whispers ."
"delighted chuckles go up all around the table , and my embarrassment hardens into anger ."
"`` why do n't you focus on the task at hand instead of sniping like a little preteen , beardy ? ''"
"i snap back at him ."
"`` wow ."
"someone 's touchy , '' he says , raising his bushy eyebrows ."
"`` i thought hot sex was supposed to be relaxing . ''"
"`` hey , bradley '' emerson cuts in , whipping around the face the alternative douche bag ."
"`` why do n't you try shutting the fuck up . ''"
"the room goes quiet around us as bradley and his cohorts back down ."
"but instead of this being a relief , it only adds to my annoyance ."
"`` do n't fight my battles for me , '' i mutter to emerson , marching toward cooper 's door ."
"`` your battles ? ''"
"he shoots back , `` you 're in this alone now , are you ?"
"i could have sworn that it takes two to oversleep after tearing up the bed sheets all night . ''"
"`` no , i 'm just- '' i begin , but the frosted glass door swings open before i can finish ."
"`` ah ."
"you 're here , '' cooper says , appearing in the doorway ."
"his jolly demeanor has totally vanished , in its place is nothing but a cool , detached stare ."
"the transformation is total , and it takes me off guard ."
"but emerson 's not worried-or at least , he 's pretending not to be ."
"`` you wanted to see us ? ''"
"emerson asks , strolling into the office ."
"i hurry in after him , feeling a dozen judgmental stares boring into my back ."
"`` yes , '' cooper replies crisply , closing the door behind him and taking a seat at his desk ."
"`` have a seat , you two . ''"
"`` have a seat ? ''"
"emerson laughs ."
"`` feeling a bit formal today , coop ? ''"
"`` just sit down , emerson , '' cooper shoots back ."
"emerson and i sink down into the two chairs before cooper 's desk ."
"our boss looks back and forth between us , his expression unreadable ."
"emerson , for his part , looks cool as a cucumber ."
"i , on the other hand , probably look like i 'm going to be sick ."
"in fact , i just might be , depending on how this little meeting goes ."
"`` the last thing i want to do in my precious free time is intercept office gossip , '' cooper begins , crossing his arms over his sweater vest ."
"`` but the buzz about you two has been a bit impossible to ignore this morning . ''"
"`` people like to talk , '' emerson shrugs , leaning back in his chair ."
"i glance at him nervously ."
"his nonchalance could very easily read as disrespect ."
"`` be that as it may , '' cooper goes on , `` whatever it is that 's going on between you two is distracting the rest of your coworkers . ''"
"`` again , i do n't see how that 's news , '' emerson presses , `` they need to mind their own business and focus on their work . ''"
"`` that 's rather rich , coming from you , '' cooper says testily ."
"`` what are you talking about ? ''"
"emerson replies , `` i take my work for bastian very seriously , cooper ."
"you know that . ''"
"`` oh ? ''"
"cooper shoots back , `` is that why you missed our conference call with new zealand this morning ?"
"because you take this work so seriously ? ''"
"i watch as the color drains out of emerson 's face ."
"for the first time since we woke up this morning , he falters ."
"`` damn , '' emerson murmurs , sitting up in his chair , `` new zealand ."
"i forgot ."
"cooper , i 'm sorry ."
"i just- '' `` just what ? ''"
"cooper cuts him off ."
"`` overslept ?"
"blew it off ?"
"what explanation could you possibly have ?"
"you 're my right hand man in europe , sawyer , but that does n't mean you can just come and go as you please ."
"i thought you were committed to your position here . ''"
"`` i am , '' emerson insists , `` it was just a mistake ."
"look , abby and i have been having a pretty strange week- '' i wince as i 'm brought into the conversation ."
"cooper raises an eyebrow looking at me ."
"`` a strange week ? ''"
"he says flatly , `` miss rowan , has your first week here been so prohibitively strange that you 've just decided not to come into work at all ? ''"
"`` i. i 'm not , '' i stammer , `` it 's a really long story , mr ."
"cooper . ''"
"`` i 'm listening , '' he says , training his eyes on me ."
"i look over at emerson , who nods for me to go on ."
"i draw a deep breath and continue ."
"`` i probably should have mentioned this right after my interview , '' i begin , meeting cooper 's steady gaze , `` but emerson and i are n't exactly strangers ."
"we , uh , know each other from high school , actually ."
"and when i ran into him that first day , even after our interview went so well , i was going to turn down the job because of that ."
"i was afraid things might be ... difficult . ''"
"`` so you know each other from when you were kids , '' cooper replies , `` why would that mean you had to turn down the job ? ''"
"`` we did n't just know each other , '' emerson cuts in , `` we were ... our parents were together , for a while ."
"they were even married , for a very short time . ''"
"cooper 's eyes cloud over as he looks back and forth between us ."
"`` but the talk in the office has been ... and you showed up here together this morning ... '' he blusters , looking more disturbed by the second , `` i was under the impression that there was some sort of romantic relationship happening between you ? ''"
"for once , even emerson is silent as we stare at cooper ."
"our boss shakes his head , unable or unwilling to put the pieces together ."
"`` but you ca n't be seeing each other , then ."
"not if your parents- '' `` it 's complicated , '' i say quietly , my fingernails digging into my palms ."
"`` that 's not the word i would have used , '' cooper scoffs ."
"`` hey , '' emerson jumps in , `` you do n't have all the details , cooper . ''"
"`` and believe me , i do n't want them , '' our boss says quickly , shoving a hand through his hair ."
"`` what i want is for you two to tell me what the hell i 'm supposed to do , here ? ''"
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"emerson says , his jaw tensing angrily ."
"`` i mean , i have a new employee who ca n't seem to show up for work , a senior employee who 's more interested in carrying on some perverted relationship with his stepsister than pulling his weight , and an office full of people who ca n't talk about anything but the two of you ! ''"
"cooper rants furiously ."
"`` emerson ! ''"
"i cry out , as he lunges to his feet and towers over cooper 's desk ."
"in an instant , it 's like he 's eighteen again , facing off against his tormentors ."
"his entire body is alive with powerful rage , and i 'm truly afraid of what he might do next ."
"`` do n't you dare presume to judge me , '' emerson growls ."
"i watch as cooper 's eyes bug out of his head in alarm ."
"`` get out of my face , sawyer ! ''"
"our boss cries , shrinking back into his chair ."
"`` you do n't know the first thing about my life , '' emerson rages on , shaking , `` abby is the best thing that 's ever happened to me , and i 'm not going to let you shit on what we have . ''"
"`` fine ! ''"
"cooper shoots back , `` you two go off and live in whatever kind of sin you prefer , just do n't do it under my nose ! ''"
"`` are you trying to fire me , cooper ? ''"
"emerson growls ."
"`` i ca n't fire you ."
"you 're under contract ."
"and all of the partners need to agree before terminating someone , '' cooper says , exasperated ."
"`` but i 'd strongly suggest that you consider- '' `` i quit , '' emerson cuts him off , pushing roughly away from the desk ."
"`` great , '' cooper shouts , `` good idea , sawyer ."
"just walk away from the agency because you 're caught up on a piece of ass . ''"
"my vision flashes bright white as my boss 's words sink in ."
"before emerson can launch himself across the desk at cooper , i leap to my feet and block his path ."
"i stare down at cooper , the corners of my vision blurring with rage ."
"`` i am not some piece of ass , '' i say , my voice clear and strong , `` i was almost the best graphic designer you ever had ."
"but you blew it ."
"if emerson goes , i go too . ''"
"`` fine , '' cooper seethes , looking back and forth between us , `` just get out before i call security on both your asses . ''"
"`` no problem , '' emerson says , grabbing my hand ."
"we storm out the door together , our shoulders squared ."
"`` good luck , you two , '' cooper calls sarcastically after us as we march across the community work space ."
"`` enjoy your incestuous little cabal while you can . ''"
"our coworkers rubberneck to get a better view of us as we pass , but one withering look from emerson and they all pry their eyes away ."
"we charge down the stairs and back out into the light of day ."
"just a few days ago , i was walking into this office and landing my dream job ."
"emerson was one of the most important people in this agency ."
"and now here we are , out on our asses ."
"and all because we tried to make a go of being together ."
"`` well , '' emerson says through gritted teeth , `` guess i was wrong about oversleeping not being a big deal , huh ? ''"
"i open my mouth to answer , but the ringing of my cell phone interrupts me ."
"i snatch the device out of my purse and see that riley is calling ."
"after her dozens of texts and calls over the course of last night , i figure i 'd better at least answer once ."
"`` ri , it 's really not a good time , '' i say into the phone , turning away from emerson ."
"`` yeah , tell me something i do n't know , '' she replies , sounding panicked ."
"`` where the hell are you , abby ? ''"
"`` i 'm at work , '' i tell her , `` or ... the place that was work for a second , at least ."
"what 's going on , riley ?"
"are you ok ? ''"
"`` i 've been trying to call you all night , '' she hurries on , `` abby , there were some papers delivered to the apartment last night from your grandparents ' lawyer ."
"they 're kicking us out of the apartment , effective immediately . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"i ask , nearly voiceless with shock ."
"this ca n't be happening ."
"not right now ."
"`` apparently they were n't kidding when they said you had to choose between them and emerson , '' she goes on , `` they had n't heard from you , so they 're kicking us out ."
"unless you assure them that emerson wo n't be a part of your life , that is . ''"
"i 'm silent for a long moment , just watching as the other people on the sidewalk pass me by ."
"then , for lack of a rational response , i start to laugh ."
"wildly ."
"emerson looks at me as if i 've sprouted a second head , but his confusion only sets me off further ."
"this ca n't all be happening to me ."
"and yet , here it all is , landing in my lap in a heap ."
"`` have you totally lost it ? ''"
"riley asks me over the phone ."
"`` it 's possible , '' i cackle , gripping my sides , `` it 's very possible . ''"
"i should have known better than to feel sunny about my twenty-sixth year ."
"in a matter of hours , i 've managed to lose my new job , my apartment , and the only family i have left ."
"every stable thing i 've muscled into place has disappeared ."
"`` abby ? ''"
"emerson says , as i let the phone drop from my ear ."
"`` why do n't we head home now and talk all this out ? ''"
"`` home , '' i repeat , my voice going hollow on me , `` i do n't think i have one of those anymore , emerson . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"he asks , his brow furrowing ."
"`` i 've been evicted ."
"by my grandparents , '' i tell him , wondering at the statement even as it leaves my lips ."
"`` i do n't understand ."
"why would they do something like that ? ''"
"he asks , outraged on my behalf ."
"`` you 're their granddaughter . ''"
"`` cooper is n't the only one who disapproves of us being together , '' i reply , `` my grandparents forbid me from seeing you after the other night ."
"they said i could either be a part of their lives , or a part of yours . ''"
"i watch the news sink into emerson 's mind ."
"his outrage softens as he understands what i 've sacrificed for him ."
"and why losing my job now is such a huge deal ."
"`` well ."
"you can borrow my home , then , '' he says , the hardness draining from his voice as he drapes an arm over my shoulder ."
"`` everything 's going to be ok. '' i let him guide me back through the lower east side ."
"i feel shell-shocked , blindsided ."
"like every bit of context organizing my life has fallen away all at once ."
"or at least , every bit of context besides emerson himself ."
"for now , just having him by my side is enough ."
"we can figure out the rest along the way ."
"chapter seventeen after i 've made sure that riley is n't going to be left out in the cold tonight , i settle in for a long , befuddled evening at emerson 's place ."
"the hours creep past as i try to process everything that 's happened , and what i 'm supposed to do now ."
"emerson and i are both out of a job , i 'm out of a home , and he 's bound for europe at the end of the week ."
"so much for that bright , shiny future i 'd been so optimistic about ."
"emerson spends about an hour on the phone with cooper and the other bastian partners when we get back to his loft ."
"they argue incessantly , trying to hammer out a truce ."
"no one at that company wants to see emerson leave , least of all emerson ."
"but with everything that went down between him and cooper this afternoon , i do n't see what other choice there is ."
"for my part , i spend the better part of the afternoon absentmindedly patting roxie 's head and trying to work up the nerve to call my grandparents ."
"surely , they 're just bluffing ."
"they do n't actually expect me to bend to their will and never see emerson again ."
"or do they ?"
"`` well , '' emerson sighs , emerging from his bedroom having hung up on the hour long conference call ."
"`` they 've backed off the whole firing-me front ."
"now it 's just a matter of whether or not i want to back off the i-quit front . ''"
"`` so ? ''"
"i ask , as he sits down beside me , `` what do you think you 're going to do ? ''"
"`` for starters , '' he says , brushing a lock of hair out of my face , `` i 'm going to open another bottle of wine ."
"helps me think . ''"
"he offers me his hand and pulls me off the couch , towing me back to the kitchen island ."
"`` have you talked to your grandparents yet ? ''"
"he asks me , selecting a bottle of merlot to start with ."
"`` no , '' i say faintly , burying my face in my hands ."
"`` i do n't know what the hell i 'd even say to them . ''"
"`` say they 're a couple of assholes who should fuck right off , '' emerson shrugs , fetching a wine opener ."
"`` i do n't want them to fuck off , '' i exclaim , `` they 're my family , emerson ."
"why ca n't you understand that that 's important to me ? ''"
"`` maybe because i know just how badly family can mess you up , '' he replies , popping out the cork ."
"`` you think i do n't know that ? ''"
"i ask ."
"`` if you do , you seem to have forgotten , '' he remarks , taking two wine glasses down from the cupboard ."
"`` maybe i 'm just not ready to give up on my family so easily , '' i say without thinking ."
"emerson pauses with his back to me , his shoulders going stiff ."
"`` what is that supposed to mean , abby ? ''"
"he asks , his voice deathly quiet ."
"`` just that i 've never been the type of person who cuts and runs on the people who care about her , '' i say , wavering in my stance ."
"`` and i am ? ''"
"he asks , irate as he turns to face me ."
"`` i was my mother 's nurse for years while my father was away ."
"i 'd probably still be taking care of her if she 'd ever gotten well enough for outpatient treatment again . ''"
"`` i know , emerson , '' i say , edging away from his rage ."
"after the flare of anger i saw go through him at the office today , i do n't want to provoke him any further ."
"`` for fuck 's sake , i had to raise my mother , rather than have her raise me , '' emerson fumes , clutching the edge of the counter ."
"his knuckles go white with the force of his grip ."
"`` i did n't mean to upset you , '' i tell him , trying to keep my voice calm , `` i know how much you sacrificed for your mom ."
"but you know better than anyone how painful it is , having your family not be there for you ."
"cutting my grandparents out of my life should be easy , but it 's not for me . ''"
"`` it 's not like they 're giving you much of a choice , '' emerson says ."
"`` i just have to figure out a way to get through to them , '' i say shaking my head , `` without this job , i 'm going to need a place to stay , at least for a little while . ''"
"`` you have a place to stay , '' emerson replies quizzically , `` right here . ''"
"`` i know you 're letting me stay here tonight , '' i tell him , `` but i mean long term , emerson . ''"
"`` maybe i mean long term too , abby , '' he shoots back , his anger fading to determination ."
"`` what are you talking about ? ''"
"i ask him , `` you 're not even staying here long term ."
"you 're going back to london at the end of the week . ''"
"`` only if i decide to keep my job at bastian , '' he says ."
"i stare at him , jaw hanging out ."
"`` you 're not seriously considering quitting ? ''"
"i ask , `` that job is once-in-a-lifetime ."
"bastian is the best in the field ."
"you ca n't walk away from that . ''"
"`` sure i can , '' he challenges me , stepping around the island toward me , `` after the way cooper disrespected us this morning ?"
"why would i want to stay ? ''"
"`` no , '' i say , `` no , emerson ."
"you ca n't leave that agency on my account . ''"
"`` and why not ? ''"
"he demands , placing his hands on my hips ."
"`` because , '' i splutter , staring up at him , `` i ca n't ... that 's too much pressure !"
"i ca n't be responsible for you losing your job . ''"
"`` i 'm responsible for you losing yours , '' he points out ."
"`` yeah ."
"but , '' i stammer , resting my hands on his firm chest ."
"`` i was doing perfectly well before bastian hired me , '' emerson says , `` i can do perfectly well without them now . ''"
"`` but what if you start resenting me ?"
"you know ... for making you leave ? ''"
"i ask , unable to meet his gaze ."
"`` that would never happen , '' he says , turning my face toward his ."
"`` you do n't know that , '' i insist ."
"`` yes i do , '' he says , his eyes flashing angrily ."
"`` i know myself , abby ."
"i know what i care about ."
"and what i care about above all is you ."
"i do n't want to work for any company that does n't value you as much as i do . ''"
"`` then what are we supposed to do , huh ? ''"
"i ask , taking a step away from him ."
"`` anything we want ! ''"
"he exclaims , `` i have enough money saved up from my first few app sales to last us two lifetimes ! ''"
"`` and i 'm just supposed to be content , living off your money ? ''"
"i ask archly , crossing my arms ."
"`` remember how well that worked for my dad ?"
"and your mom ? ''"
"`` it 's not the same thing , '' he says sternly ."
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHUNK 2:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"`` i do n't see any difference , '' i say , shaking my head ."
"`` my dad never had any pride in himself , because he just lived off his parents ' money his whole life ."
"i was already headed down that road with my grandparents , but bastian was finally going to get me on my own two feet ."
"i need to find another job , another way to be independent , not another meal ticket . ''"
"`` is that what i 'd be to you ? ''"
"emerson asks heatedly , `` a meal ticket ? ''"
"`` of course not ! ''"
"i cry , `` i love you , emerson ."
"i loved you when you were a penniless eighteen-year-old and i love you now ! ''"
"`` so what the fuck are we arguing about ? ''"
"he shouts , slamming his fist down on the island ."
"`` it 's just money , abby ."
"it does n't mean anything . ''"
"`` no , it- '' `` it means nothing , '' he insists , `` you sharing my life , my resources , would n't mean that you were bound to me , or that you owed me anything ."
"it would n't mean i had power over you , it would just mean ... that you we here ."
"with me ."
"that we were in this together . ''"
"`` emerson , i do n't ... '' i whisper , trying to wrap my head around what he 's suggesting ."
"`` i do n't know how to think of money as anything but a bargaining chip ."
"my family- '' `` your family is fucked up , pardon my saying , '' he cuts me off ."
"`` your grandparents use their money as a weapon ."
"but me ?"
"i 'd like to use mine as a gift ."
"a way out , for both of us ."
"why wo n't you let me do that for you ?"
"for us ? ''"
"`` i 'm just ... i 'm sorry ... '' i say , trying to blink back the tears that have sprung to my eyes ."
"`` i just need to think . ''"
"`` fine , '' emerson says , his jaw set ."
"he turns on his heel , storms across the loft , and grabs up a retractable leash from the side table ."
"`` i know i should just be some alpha man idiot and storm out into the wind or whatever the fuck , but roxie needs a walk . ''"
"the westie goes galloping over to emerson when he whistles ."
"emerson attaches the leash to her collar and looks up at me ."
"`` i 'll give you some time to think everything over ."
"have some wine if you like ."
"if you want to leave before i get back and find some other way ... i wo n't hold it against you ."
"just make up your mind , abby ."
"you know what i want . ''"
"before i can say another word , he wrenches open the front door and disappears with roxie on his heels ."
"i fall back against the kitchen island , letting the baffled tears stream down my face ."
"with shaking hands , i fish out a bottle of cabernet from the stockpile ."
"pouring myself a very tall glass , i let my warring thoughts pour out through my mind as well ."
"emerson is willing to leave his job and share everything he has with me ."
"i , on the other hand , have no choice but to abandon my job at bastian , have no place to live , and hardly any money to my name ."
"if he and i were to start a life together now , i 'd be bringing nothing to the table ."
"shudderingly , i remember how i felt about deb when she showed up on the scene ."
"i thought she was desperate , and manipulative , and a helpless dependent ."
"how would what emerson is proposing make me any different from her ?"
"as much as i hate to admit it , i 've been living off the generosity of my family for my whole life so far ."
"sure , i worked hard to get into a good college and paid most of my tuition with scholarships , but i have privilege coming out the wazoo ."
"and now , what-i 'm just going to marry rich and have that be that ?"
"how am i supposed to live with myself if i go down that path ?"
"i have to earn my own way through life ."
"it 's what i 've always wanted ."
"i take a huge gulp of wine and feel it go straight to my head via my empty stomach ."
"getting trashed is not the solution here , but i have no other brilliant ideas ."
"i wish that i had someone to talk about all of this ."
"riley 's probably furious with me for getting us evicted , and it 's not like i 'm going to call my grandparents up ."
"it 's times like this when i most keenly feel the loss of my mother ."
"i wish more than anything that she was here for me to talk to ."
"she 'd be able to help me through this mess ."
"but of course , that 's just a dream ."
"i 'm all alone in this , as ever ."
"`` well , self , '' i mutter , raising the wine glass to the empty apartment , `` it 's just you and me again ."
"let 's figure out what we 're going to do . ''"
"i nearly lose my balance on the bar stool as a loud knocking rings out from the front entry way ."
"that 's weird ."
"emerson just left five minutes ago , and besides , he has a key ."
"we did n't order any food , and there 's no way riley 's swinging by to say hello after what i 've done to her ."
"so then who could possibly be knocking at this hour ?"
"cradling my wine glass , i stand and cross to the front door ."
"probably it 's just emerson 's dry cleaning , or something ."
"billionaires have things like dry cleaning delivery , right ?"
"i step into the entryway and unlock the front door , swinging it open with my free hand ."
"there 's a man standing on emerson 's front steps ."
"he wears a dated but clean sport coat , a fair amount of stubble , and scuffed shoes that must once have been very expensive ."
"his hands are clasped nervously in front of him , and his hunched shoulders give him a look of preemptive defeat ."
"there are red splotches across his nose and cheeks , signature features of an alcoholic ."
"the man is staring at shoes , and for a moment i ca n't place him ."
"but then , he lifts his face to me , and i feel the wind rush out of my lungs ."
"`` dad ? ''"
"i breathe , paralyzed in the doorway ."
"`` hello abigail , '' he replies with heartbreaking formality ."
"`` i hope this is n't a bad time ."
"well ."
"i know it is , but ... can i come in ? ''"
"`` oh ."
"of course , '' i tell him , stepping aside to let him in ."
"my dad shuffles past me into emerson 's loft , looking as frail as i 've ever seen him ."
"i stare after him , utterly baffled by his sudden appearance here ."
"i have n't seen him since my masters program graduation ceremony , and even then he barely said hello before disappearing into thin air again ."
"he 's not exactly an active presence in my life , so what the hell is he doing here , on one of the most intense nights of my life ?"
"`` dad , '' i begin , watching as he stands awkwardly in the middle of emerson 's loft , `` why are you here ? ''"
"`` your grandparents ."
"they told me what was going on , '' he mutters , `` i figured you might be in a tough spot , so i thought i 'd come and try to ... i do n't know ."
"help ? ''"
"`` but how did you even find this place ? ''"
"i ask ."
"`` your friend ."
"roommate ."
"she mentioned you were with emerson ."
"this address was n't too hard to find , '' he shrugs ."
"i take a nervous sip of wine and immediately feel horrible for doing so as my dad shifts uncomfortably ."
"`` i 'm sorry , i should n't , '' i murmur , setting down my wine glass ."
"`` no , it 's ok , '' dad assures me , `` i 've been sober for a solid six months . ''"
"i bite my lip ."
"six months is always about how long he lasts between relapses ."
"i do n't want to set him off ."
"what i do want is to understand what possessed my father to track me down tonight ."
"we have n't had a real conversation in years ."
"really , not since his falling out with deb ."
"his endless cycle of relapses and recoveries has broken him own ."
"he looks feeble , now ."
"broken ."
"i hate to see him like this ."
"`` so ? ''"
"i prompt him , `` are you here to save me from the evil emerson sawyer ?"
"are you going to tell me that grandma and grandpa are right , and that i should steer clear of him if i know what 's good for me ? ''"
"`` no , '' my dad replies , shoving his hands into his pockets ."
"`` no ? ''"
"i reply , taken aback ."
"`` but- '' `` i 'm not here to save you from emerson , '' my dad goes on , `` i 'm here to save you-try and save you-from yourself . ''"
"`` you 're gon na have to drop a few more bread crumbs if you expect me to follow this , '' i tell him , crossing my arms ."
"`` i know this is going to sound insane , coming from me , '' my dad says , struggling with his heart-to-heart dynamic ."
"`` but when your grandpa told me what the situation was , it 's like i knew what you 'd be thinking ."
"you 'd be thinking , 'i should just give up on emerson , ' and 'it 's too hard , ' and 'it 's not right to let someone help me , i need to go it alone ' . ''"
"i stare at him across the room , flummoxed by how spot-on he is ."
"my dad and i have never once understood each other ."
"he 's never even made the attempt to understand my experiences ."
"we do n't talk ."
"we especially do n't listen ."
"but here he is now , speaking to what i actually have been thinking and feeling ."
"what the hell am i supposed to do with that ?"
"`` dad ... '' i say slowly , `` are you telling me that i should stay with emerson ? ''"
"`` i think i am , '' he says , as if surprised by the conclusion ."
"`` but you hate emerson , '' i remind him , `` you two nearly killed each other that day- '' `` please , '' dad says , holding up his hands for me stop , `` let 's not go there . ''"
"`` sorry , '' i backtrack , `` i 'm just a little confused , here . ''"
"`` i never knew how to do right by you , abby , '' my dad says quietly , lifting his eyes to mind , `` but that 's not your fault ."
"it 's on me ."
"when you were growing up , i never gave your needs the same weight as mine ."
"never thought about how things would effect you ."
"i was totally blindsided by how much emerson came to mean to you back then ."
"i did n't even stop to consider how wonderful it was that you 'd found someone you could talk to , share things with ."
"god knows i was n't helping you on that front . ''"
"`` do n't say that , '' i reply , a knot forming in my throat ."
"`` i 've always loved you , dad ."
"you have to know that . ''"
"`` and i love you , '' he says , crossing the room tentatively toward me ."
"`` i 've just been pretty terrible at letting you know that . ''"
"with great care , dad takes my hands in his ."
"he looks at me intently , and for the first time in my life i feel like he 's actually seeing me ."
"`` abby , '' he says , `` do you love emerson as much as you did when you were a kid ? ''"
"`` no , '' i whisper hoarsely , `` i love him so much more , now . ''"
"`` then do n't run away , '' he says , squeezing my hands , `` stay and work through this with him ."
"do n't refuse him out of pride , or some idea of propriety ."
"it 's ok to let people help you ."
"especially the people who love you more than anything . ''"
"`` but what if something goes wrong ? ''"
"i ask earnestly , `` what if we start to resent each other , or feel tied down , or change our minds- '' `` then at least you 'll know for sure where you stand , '' my dad cuts me off ."
"`` i know you 've been in pain since you and emerson were forced apart ."
"it was my fault that happened ."
"mine and deb 's ."
"but can you honestly tell me you have n't spent the past decade wondering what would have happened between you and emerson 'if only ' ?"
"i ca n't let you spend the next ten years wondering ."
"hurting ."
"i need you to hear me now , abby . ''"
"`` i hear you , '' i tell him , and it 's true ."
"`` i know it 's scary , sweetheart , '' dad says , resting his hands on my shoulders , `` but you 've got to jump , now ."
"it 's time . ''"
"`` ok , '' i whisper , `` ok , dad . ''"
"`` ok , you 'll jump ? ''"
"he presses ."
"`` i 'll jump , '' i tell him , `` but i may fall , you know . ''"
"`` there 's always that chance , '' he says sadly , `` trust me , i know ."
"but you know what 'll happen if you do n't fall ?"
"you 'll fly . ''"
"he kisses my forehead and wraps his arms around me ."
"i hug him back , ferociously ."
"i think this might be the first honest moment we 've ever shared together ."
"and all i had to do was let my life get almost entirely derailed to bring it about ."
"life 's funny , is n't it ?"
"my dad and i both look up as the front door swings open and a small bundle of fur bounds into the loft ."
"roxie runs right up to me , whiny with delight to find me still here ."
"when emerson steps into the loft after her , the same look of relief floods his eyes ."
"he was worried i 'd be gone by now ."
"that relief gives way to surprise as he recognizes my dad standing next to me ."
"`` bob ? ''"
"emerson says , looking back and forth between us ."
"`` hi , emerson , '' my dad replies , going to shake emerson 's hand ."
"`` sorry to drop in unannounced , i just needed to have a word with my daughter . ''"
"`` oh ."
"sure , '' emerson says , giving my dad 's hand a firm shake ."
"`` you guys have a lot to talk about ."
"i 'll get out of your hair , '' dad says ."
"`` but , emerson ... i know i have no right to ask anything of you , given how i 've treated you in the past ."
"it 's just-be good to her ."
"be better to her than i ever was . ''"
"`` i intend to be , '' emerson says , training his eyes on my dad ."
"`` whatever she decides that means to her . ''"
"my dad smiles , faintly but resolutely , gives me a final wave , and sees himself out ."
"emerson and i stare after him as the door closes quietly in his wake ."
"for a moment , the only movement in the room comes from roxie 's exuberant tail-wagging ."
"when emerson finally swings his gaze my way , his eyes are full of cautious hope ."
"`` so ... '' he begins , `` did your dad have any good advice ? ''"
"`` you know what ? ''"
"i laugh softly , `` he really did . ''"
"`` did that advice involve getting as far away from me as humanly possible ? ''"
"emerson asks , taking a step forward ."
"`` not at all , '' i tell him , countering his step , `` in fact , it was just the opposite . ''"
"`` huh , '' emerson replies , as we slowly move toward each other in a dance of barely-contained desire ."
"`` does that mean ... you 've come to some kind of decision ?"
"about what you want to do happen next ? ''"
"`` it means that i 'm ready to ask for what i 've wanted for the last ten years , '' i reply , as we meet in the center of the loft ."
"i take his hands , take a breath , and take that final leap ."
"`` i want to be with you , emerson ."
"now and always ."
"i know that what we have is unconventional , and that it 's not going to be an easy journey ."
"but there 's no one else i 'd rather be on my journey with ."
"so if you 'll still have me , i 'd like to stay here ."
"with you . ''"
"`` if i 'll still have you ? ''"
"emerson breathes , taking me into his arms , `` i 'd give up everything to still have you in my life ."
"not that i 'm suggesting that as a game plan , but ... '' `` we 're really going to do this ? ''"
"i ask , wrapping my arms around his shoulders ."
"`` we are , '' he replies , circling my waist , `` no one can stop us , abby ."
"not like before ."
"there 's no one we need to apologize to , nothing we have to explain ."
"we 're free . ''"
"i press myself to him , bringing my lips to his ."
"our kiss is searing , binding , full of promise and hope ."
"roxie runs circles around us as our mouths move together , making up for lost time ."
"i grin as i kiss him , happy tears running down my cheeks ."
"as we finally break apart , emerson brushes a lock of hair behind my ear , gazing at me with great purpose ."
"`` there 's just one last thing we have to figure out , then , '' he says , his voice rasping with emotion as he takes my right hand in his ."
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"i ask , wiping the tears away ."
"he looks down at my hand , rubbing his thumb over the single pearl glimmering on my finger ."
"i feel my breath catch in my throat as i guess his meaning ."
"`` would you rather be wearing this ... on the other hand ? ''"
"he asks , his blue eyes gleaming as they drink me in ."
"`` are you ... do you mean ... ? ''"
"i stammer , all my composure going right out the window ."
"emerson 's face breaks into a gorgeous grin as he slowly lowers himself onto one knee before me ."
"i laugh with confounded elation as he slips the pearl ring off my right hand ."
"`` what do you say ? ''"
"he asks , holding the ring up to me ."
"`` i say ... let 's jump , '' i breathe , staring down at him ."
"his smile grows impossibly wide as he slides the band onto my left ring finger ."
"turns out that i chose my engagement ring when i was just seventeen years old ."
"and you know what ?"
"i chose the person i wanted to share my life with when i was seventeen , too ."
"it just took us both a while to realize it ."
"emerson stands and scoops me up into his arms as we both burst into ecstatic laughter ."
"this has to be the least conventional relationship anyone 's ever heard of , but it 's ours ."
"no one can take us away from each other , no one else gets the final say ."
"but there is one last thing i have to ask him , now ."
"`` are you going to take me to bed now or what ? ''"
"i grin , running my hands along his impeccably cut chest ."
"he slips an arm under my knees , and carries me toward the bedroom like a bride on her wedding night ."
"we 're getting a bit ahead of ourselves , maybe ."
"but we 've always done things out of order , emerson and i ."
"only now are we catching up to where we left off at eighteen ."
"but if there 's one thing i 'm sure of now , after all these years , is that what we have has always-always-been worth the wait ."
"epilogue one year later ..."
"i push down on the top of the french press and pour the delicious-smelling coffee into three generous mugs ."
"two excited voices banter behind me , and i turn toward them with a smile ."
"`` here we are , '' i say , setting the three mugs down on the kitchen island , `` we ca n't plot brilliant business strategy without coffee . ''"
"`` that , my dear , is a fact , '' riley says , gratefully taking her cup ."
"`` here , here , '' emerson replies , grabbing one for himself ."
"i settle down at the island beside them ."
"the entire surface is covered with outlines , graphs , and ideas ."
"a flurry of excited butterflies rally around my stomach as i look over all our hard work ."
"`` this is really happening , is n't it ? ''"
"i grin ."
"`` sure is , '' riley replies , `` you guys are ready to launch . ''"
"`` i just have one more feature i want to add to the app , and we 'll be golden , '' emerson says , stepping my way and slipping his arm around my slender waist ."
"`` you feeling good , ms ."
"founding partner ? ''"
"`` good and ready , mr ."
"founding partner , '' i laugh , clinking my coffee mug to his ."
"for the past year , emerson and i have been hard at work developing a suite of new applications to take the world by storm ."
"the suite will be the centerpiece and first project of our two-person creative collective : treehouse ."
"we 're the founding partners , ceos , and only employees-save for our pr consultant , riley , and our de facto mascot , roxie ."
"but though we may be small , i feel very good about our operation ."
"our first batch of apps is targeted at friends and family of people struggling with substance abuse ."
"there are resources , information , and support available through this modest suite of applications ."
"there 's even a way for individuals to get in touch with each other , share the burden of living with and loving someone who 's self-destructing ."
"basically , it 's everything emerson and i wish we had as kids , everything we were eventually able to give each other ... only in app form ."
"hey , it 's 2015 , after all ."
"`` all you need to do is press 'publish ' and you 'll be good to go ! ''"
"riley says excitedly ."
"`` would you like to do the honors ? ''"
"emerson asks , sliding a tablet my way with the suite of apps pulled up , ready to be launched ."
"`` we 'll do it together , '' i say , taking his hand in mine ."
"i feel his wedding band brush against my hand and get a little thrill ."
"we only just said `` i do '' at a small city hall ceremony last month , so seeing his wedding band is still new ."
"`` together , '' emerson agrees , `` naturally . ''"
"`` get on with it , lovebirds ! ''"
"riley says excitedly , `` i want to put out the press release ! ''"
"with hands clasped , emerson and i each lower a finger to the `` big red button , '' and introduce the world to our latest idea ."
"after months of tireless effort , it feels wonderful ."
"there may have been a time when starting my own business , launching a brand new product , and subjecting myself to the crazy world of the internet may have been terrifying ."
"but as i look up at emerson , i realize that i 've already taken the biggest , best risk of my life ."
"nothing can stop me now ."
"scratch that , i think , as emerson scoops me up into a celebratory kiss ."
"nothing can stop us , now ."
"the end chapter 1 the sun was hot and the humidity within the city was oppressive ."
"the moist air caused the traffic pollution to mix with the scents of the restaurants and the other odors that were distinctly city oriented to hover in the air , pressing down on the occupants as if it were a heavy blanket with no hope of relenting any time soon ."
"just like that first day , victoria phillips thought to herself ."
"the horrifying thought startled her and she stopped in her tracks , terrified of those memories ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she said out loud and shivered , not wanting any of those feelings to come back into her mind now ."
"`` this is ridiculous ! ''"
"she pushed herself harder , walking as if a demon were on her back in an effort to reach the school where she was a guidance counselor for an elementary school ."
"why was she thinking about that day again ?"
"five years ago , she 'd worked hard to eliminate all that pain from her system ."
"why was it coming back now ?"
"she was late , she told herself , just like that morning so long ago and she was rushing ."
"victoria looked around , searching for a long , dark car that would indicate that the past was going to repeat itself ."
"when she saw the car parked in front of the school , her steps faltered and her breath caught in her throat ."
"it could n't be !"
"blinking hard , she opened her eyes once again and stared in front of her , sure that her eyes were playing tricks on her ."
"but the elegant limousine did n't disappear ."
"it sat there , ominously mocking her as if it were a giant snake about to reach out and attack her with a venomous bite ."
"she almost dropped her bag and ran the other way ."
"the pain ripping through her heart was almost as intense as it had been that day five years ago ."
"when a tall , dark man with a muscular frame got out of the car , she gasped as the painful memories came flooding back to her ."
"sure enough , there he was ."
"and , impossibly , he was bigger and more handsome than she remembered him ."
"five years earlier a taxi sped by , his horn blaring at some perceived offense , then drove past , leaving the smell of exhaust permeating the earth in its wake ."
"victoria pulled her thick brown hair off her neck , wishing she 'd taken a few more minutes that morning to pin up the heavy curtain of soft , brown curls ."
"but after spending most of the previous night in the library studying , she had n't wanted to wake up early enough to take the time to do anything more than shower and change before heading off to her morning classes ."
"her green , almond shaped eyes looked up at the sky , noting the red disk of the sun ."
"that was never a good sign , she thought ."
"she remembered her father 's saying , `` red sun at night , sailor 's delight ."
"red sun in morning , sailor 's take warning . ''"
"what warning they would take , she was n't sure ."
"he never went farther than just quoting the phrase ."
"she suspected that it meant they would have a hot , humid , awful day ."
"just like today was starting out to be ."
"she pulled her hair over her shoulder , trying to give her back some relief from the heat ."
"since she 'd been so rushed earlier , she was paying the price since her hair was sticking to her neck and her sundress , which had seemed such a pretty , lively and more importantly , cool , choice earlier in the day ."
"the dress was unfortunately covering her legs which could be the grateful recipient of what little breeze was available if she 'd chosen her normal choice of shorts and a tee-shirt ."
"hefting her heavy bag of books more securely onto her shoulder , she hurried on to her class , wishing she did n't have to travel so far through london ."
"unfortunately , her tiny dorm room was on the opposite side of the campus from her class and there was nothing to do for it but walk faster or be late ."
"she was hurrying with her head bowed low in an effort to keep the sun off her face and out of her eyes so she did n't see the limousine pull up beside the tall building ."
"out of the corner of her eye , she saw a door open and a tall man get out , surrounded by other men who were shorter , but scarier looking ."
"unfortunately , even those nebulous thoughts did n't enter into her mind quickly enough ."
"she was walking too fast with a book bag that was too heavy , leaving her off balance so when the men started walking into the building , she was n't able to stop herself fast enough ."
"as if in slow motion , victoria saw her bag slip from her shoulder , then the arm swing wide , knocking her chin and tossing her to her knees ."
"the sudden burst of pain came from several directions all at once ."
"she could feel the cement dig into the soft skin of her knees as she slid across the rough surface , then the pain entered the palms of her hands as she tried to keep her face from a similar fate as her knees ."
"both palms were subjected to the same rough surface but even that was n't her primary pain ."
"her jaw was suddenly aching as if it had been lit on fire , then the throbbing told her that she 'd been hit for some bizarre reason ."
"her confused eyes looked around , trying to identify the source and reason for the strike but nothing in the world made sense to her pain-fogged brain ."
"as all of these sensations were tallied in her brain , a distant crying sound penetrated and that was the only issue she was able to deal with at the moment ."
"looking around , her eyes searched for and found the little girl who was now clinging to her mother 's leg ."
"victoria stood up , ignoring the pain that shot through her hands , knees and face with the effort ."
"going over to the little girl , she smiled , battling the sharp stab of pain from her jaw and bent down to the child 's level ."
"`` do n't worry , sweetheart , '' victoria said calmly ."
"`` i 'm okay ."
"are you hurt ? ''"
"she asked ."
"the mother also bent down to reassure her daughter and after several moments , the two of them were able to calm the child enough so that she was smiling again ."
"`` what 's your name ? ''"
"victoria asked , when the child had overcome her crying ."
"`` lucy , '' the girl said ."
"`` lucy , i hope you have a very nice rest of the day and i think you are sweet to be concerned for me . ''"
"the little girl , who had to be no more than five or six years old , reached out a chubby hand and gently touched victoria 's face ."
"`` does it hurt ? ''"
"she asked ."
"she noticed the little girl looking over victoria 's shoulder shyly but she kept her attention solely on lucy and her anxiety ."
"victoria was n't sure who was behind her and hid her curiosity well from lucy , preferring to deal with one problem at a time ."
"`` not really ."
"i 'm made of pretty tough stuff , '' she said , grinning broadly for lucy 's benefit ."
"the mother smiled at victoria , then at her daughter ."
"`` see ?"
"everything is okay ."
"are you ready to go home to see daddy ?"
"he should be back by now . ''"
"lucy smiled , eager to see her father and obviously relieved that no one was hurt ."
"the child took her mother 's hand and continued with their walk home , obviously eager to tell her father about their incident of the day ."
"victoria heard the small child chattering away but the only words that she was able to understand were `` scary men '' before she was out of hearing distance ."
"victoria stood up and all the pain she 'd been pushing to the back of her brain came rushing forward ."
"her knees , palms and especially her face were suddenly on fire and she wanted to melt down into the cement and lean her sore body against the building ."
"but she knew that the little girl was n't the only one that needed reassurance and she forced herself to find the inner strength to face the other audience ."
"turning slowly , she tried to bring up another smile for the strangers she knew where standing behind her , hoping to reassure them so she could stop being a spectacle ."
"but the sight that greeted her when she turned around was too much ."
"the tall , dark man standing directly behind her , holding her book bag in one hand and reaching for her right hand with the other , was possibly the most handsome man she 'd ever seen , even from the movies ."
"`` are you sure you are okay ? ''"
"the tall , incredibly gorgeous man asked ."
"he was at least six feet three inches tall , towering over the other men around him ."
"and although they were bulkier , he was extremely muscular himself ."
"his eyes were dark , almost black as was his hair which was cut short , barely brushing the collar of his shirt ."
"victoria 's only thought was that he had a lovely accent and spoke perfect english ."
"the next thing she knew , she was watching the building swing around her and the sky was blinding her as her mind started spinning , twirling around and her eyes stopped focusing ."
"then blackness ."
"dharr hokum qudama the third , sheik of ashir , the most powerful middle eastern country with oil reserves beyond the imagination , found himself at a loss for the first time in his life as the stunningly beautiful woman in front of him slowly started falling to the earth ."
"with reflexes honed from long hours in military training and an innate sense that women should be protected at all costs , he caught the fainting woman in his arms , easily lifting her up and cradling her as his body guards opened the door to the building he had been about to enter only minutes earlier for business meetings ."
"as he stared down into her lovely face , he was startled by the perfection of her features ."
"he knew her now closed eyes were a sharp , crystal green ."
"now that he could no longer see her eyes , he noticed the flawlessness of her skin that was pale white now but a moment before had been tinted with peach color on her high cheekbones ."
"her eye lashes were long and black as they lay against her skin and he wondered if they were covered in mascara ."
"he did n't think so ."
"they looked natural but too long to be real ."
"her hair was incredible , the soft , brown curls falling like a cascade of water almost to the ground as he held her close to his chest ."
"he wanted to run his fingers in the curls just to see if they were really as soft to the touch as they looked but he did n't have a free hand at the moment ."
"shifting her slight weight in his arms , he tried to be the gentleman and not notice her petite figure but he was a man and any male with blood running through his veins would notice her ."
"her breasts were large for her small frame but she had a tiny waist and slender hips topping off long , shapely legs ."
"it was the kind of figure a woman would spend hours in the gym trying to achieve , he knew ."
"pushing thoughts of her physical assets to the side , he lifted her more closely to him , enjoying the way she felt , as if she were meant to be just for him ."
"`` to the hospital , '' dharr commanded and all five of his body guards retreated back to either the limousine or the waiting black suv that was parked in front of the building ."
"within moments , the limousine was pulled up in front of the emergency room where a doctor was standing by , obviously alerted to the situation by one of the guards phoning ahead and prepared to help in any way he could ."
"stepping out of the limousine , he refused to transfer her figure to the waiting gurney ."
"`` what is wrong with her ? ''"
"dharr demanded of the doctor who was checking the prone woman 's pulse and eyes ."
"`` do n't hurt her ! ''"
"dharr said when she started to moan softly ."
"dharr liked the way she moved , even when coming out of a dead faint ."
"she was graceful as her body slowly came back to consciousness and he watched in fascination as those lovely green eyes blinked and focused ."
"it was odd that a man with his reputation with women , someone who could , and did , have any woman he desired with the flick of his wrist , was so entranced by this one , young , lovely woman who was n't even wearing makeup or designer clothes ."
"even so , his body was instantly reacting to hers , appreciating the innocent sensuality that she conveyed with her movements ."
"the doctor was monitoring her resumption of consciousness and nodded approvingly ."
"`` i think she is okay although she has some nasty scrapes on her knees . ''"
"the doctor stepped back and watched for a moment , carefully checking for any signs of problems as she looked around the sterile emergency room that was cut off from the rest of the area only by a white sheet ."
"`` her pulse is normal ."
"she probably just stood up too quickly or has n't eaten in too long , '' he suggested ."
"victoria listened to the deep voices around her but tried not to move , afraid that the pain she was feeling in her jaw and legs would intensify ."
"all she could understand is that she was in a white room with two men looking down at her ."
"she had no idea how she 'd gotten here or why they were looking so concerned ."
"actually , the man who was obviously a doctor if his white coat and stethoscope were any indication , was not looking concerned any longer ."
"but the handsome man beside him was definitely worried ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"she croaked , then wondered why her voice was so strange ."
"the pain that shot through her jaw when she spoke also was bizarre ."
"`` you fainted , '' the handsome man replied , moving the doctor out of the way ."
"`` are you okay ? ''"
"he asked , bending down to look at her face , taking her hand in his and checking her pulse himself ."
"victoria was confused by the concern that was showing in the man 's eyes but his lips were compressed as if he were angry with her for some reason ."
"`` yes , '' she replied , then tried to sit up ."
"`` i 'm fine , '' she said , but then the dizziness came back and she grimaced , trying to keep her head from spinning by placing her hand on her forehead ."
"as soon as she tried to sit up , his hand touched her shoulder , keeping her laying flat on the bed ."
"`` you must relax for another moment ."
"no sudden moves until the doctor has said you are okay , '' the man replied ."
"the heat that went through victoria 's body when he touched her frightened her enough that she actually shrank back against the bed , unsure of herself and the man ."
"`` where am i ? ''"
"she asked , naturally turning to the taller man who had a commanding presence , giving off an aura of authority that just ignited the air around her ."
"she tried to smile to give the man the impression she was okay but she was n't sure if it worked ."
"`` you 're in a hospital , '' he explained gently ."
"victoria did n't like that word at all ."
"hospitals meant money ."
"lots of it ."
"that was one thing she did n't have , being at school on a scholarship ."
"`` the hospital ? ''"
"she yelped , sitting up quickly and evading the man 's hand while swinging off the bed on one graceful movement ."
"unfortunately , the sudden movement had her swaying again and the man 's hands reached out to steady her ."
"`` whoa ! ''"
"she said , holding onto the bed , praying she would n't make a fool of herself again and pass out ."
"after several minutes , the room stopped spinning and she was able to make sense of the words being spoken ."
"`` ... .sit back down , '' the tall man was saying firmly ."
"victoria turned her attention back to him , a frown on her face ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"she asked , looking him up and down as if he were beneath her ."
"unfortunately , the idea of what a hospital visit would do to her budget was making her a little snappish ."
"she did n't have the money to toss at a series of doctors and needed to leave as soon as possible ."
"in her current state of mind , this tall , attractive man was the main hindrance from her leaving as quickly as she could ."
"besides the expense of the hospital , he was actually ordering her around ."
"she did n't like that one bit ."
"she was n't even used to her gentle father giving her orders , she surely was n't going to take them from a stranger who thought he was in charge of the world ."
"`` who do you think you are ?"
"i do n't take orders from you , sir ."
"not even if you were the prince of wales , '' she sniffed ."
"handsome or not , she hated arrogant men !"
"and this one could give lessons ."
"dharr was shocked enough to almost smile ."
"almost ."
"how could a tiny slip of a woman speak to him like this ?"
"did n't she know who he was ?"
"the doctor obviously did if the horrified look on his face was any indication ."
"surely it was the novelty of the whole situation that amused him ."
"he would never permit such conduct otherwise , he told himself ."
"dharr waved the doctor 's protests aside before they could be spoken ."
"`` how about something to clean those scrapes , '' he said , turning to the doctor and interrupting what was probably an explanation as to why the woman should n't speak to dharr this way ."
"for some reason , dharr did n't want his anonymity broken ."
"and what dharr wanted , he got ."
"the doctor immediately disappeared , leaving the two of them alone ."
"victoria stared at the man , wondering what to do next ."
"she realized that her manners were severely lacking and knew that her mother would be horrified if she did n't make amends ."
"smiling brightly to the man , she stuck out her hand , then grimaced as she saw the ugly scrapes on the palms ."
"`` i guess i should introduce myself , '' she started off , hiding her hands from his concerned view ."
"`` i 'm victoria phillips ."
"how do you do ? ''"
"she said ."
"she extended the least abused hand , which , thankfully , was her right one ."
"dharr stared at the hand for a split second before accepting it ."
"the normal introduction would be for her to bow slightly before him but , continuing with the novelty of the situation , he took her hand in his , enfolding her cold , slim , scraped hand in his large one , covering it with the other and taking a step towards her ."
"`` it is indeed a pleasure to make your acquaintance , ms. phillips ."
"i am dharr qudama , at your service ."
"i regret the incident which caused you to be in this position ."
"i will endeavor to make it up to you , '' he said ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"she asked , her eyes wide as she looked up into his dark , intense gaze ."
"`` it was my man who caused your fall ."
"he was acting with an overzealous sense of duty and will be eliminated immediately from my guard . ''"
"victoria was horrified ."
"`` you mean you 're going to fire him ? ''"
"`` of course , '' he said , not an ounce of regret or emotion showing on his tanned face ."
"she did n't like being responsible for anyone losing their job ."
"it was a tough economy and anyone fired would have a hard time finding a new position ."
"`` but why ? ''"
"dharr reached up and gently touched a finger to the already darkening spot on her jaw ."
"`` such beauty should not be marred , ms ."
"phillips . ''"
"victoria stuttered , flustered by this man 's touch and confused as to why his touch could cause so much tumult within her system when other men 's touch just caused irritation ."
"she was also unsure of what this man represented but sure he was powerful and could genuinely hurt the man 's chances of continued employment ."
"`` but if he is on your staff , should n't you train him more thoroughly ?"
"i mean , really , if he acted inappropriately , is n't it your fault ?"
"should n't you give him a second chance ? ''"
"dharr actually smiled this time ."
"it was too much ."
"he was constantly surrounded by people vying for power and positions close to him , thereby making themselves more powerful in their associations with him ."
"but here was an innocent woman begging for a stranger 's continued employment ."
"a stranger who could have broken her jaw if his swing had been any harder ."
"what she did n't know was that dharr 's personal guard was the elite of the ashiri military , specially trained for years before they are even considered to be close to dharr ."
"these men were trained in arms , munitions and personal combat but here was a woman weighing maybe a little more than one hundred pounds and might reach five and a half feet tall protecting a man she 'd never met ."
"the doctor returned to the closed off area with cleaning supplies and dharr took them , dismissing the man with a nod ."
"as he prepared a sterile gauze to start the cleaning , he asked , `` you protect a man who wounded you ."
"yet you know nothing about him ."
"why would you do that ? ''"
"`` well , '' victoria thought hard , knowing she had to come up with a reason why the man should n't be fired or feel awful about it , `` he did n't mean to , did he ?"
"it was only an accident . ''"
"the cool liquid felt wonderful against her suddenly aching knees ."
"she had n't really noticed that they were still on fire while she was talking to the man called dharr but as she looked down , she noticed the mean looking scrapes on her knees ."
"raising the hem of her dress slightly , she saw that the scrapes were long and relatively deep ."
"`` oh , goodness , '' she said , inhaling sharply when he put the gauze on a particularly deep area ."
"`` does that hurt ? ''"
"he asked , instantly moving off the area , looking down at her face ."
"the compassion in his eyes created butterflies in her stomach ."
"she felt funny , knowing that this obviously powerful man was taking the time to clean her scrapes ."
"she also felt bad for speaking to him so harshly a few moments before ."
"`` do n't worry , '' she said , reaching out to take the gauze so she could clean the area herself ."
"for some reason , this man 's closeness was overwhelming her ."
"`` i can do that , '' she said softly ."
"she wished her hands did n't shake as she reached out to take the cleaning supplies from him ."
"dharr put a hand on her wrist to lower it , and continued his tender ministrations ."
"`` explain to me why you would defend someone you do n't know , '' he demanded ."
"victoria smiled at his autocratic tone ."
"`` you are n't very good at asking , are you ? ''"
"she teased ."
"`` asking ? ''"
"dharr questioned ."
"`` asking what ? ''"
"victoria only laughed , her suspicions confirmed ."
"`` well , that answers my question , does n't it ? ''"
"`` explain , '' he said , enjoying the dimples that suddenly appeared in her cheeks ."
"they brought his attention to her soft , full lips ."
"lips that would look lovely begging him to kiss her , he thought ."
"his command to explain only caused another chuckle to burst from victoria ."
"`` i mean , you want to know why i would defend someone but instead of putting it to me as a query , you simply demand an answer ."
"i think you 're mother would be ashamed of your manners , mr ."
"qudama . ''"
"dharr stared in shock as the tiny woman actually tssked him ."
"he could n't help but smile in response ."
"`` i do n't think my mother would be offended , '' he replied ."
"her head tilted to the side and her sharp , green eyes turned curious ."
"`` why not ?"
"i think all mothers would want their children to be raised with manners . ''"
"dharr liked the way her soft , brown hair fell over her shoulder as she tilted her head ."
"it was lovely , he thought and again he had the impulse to bury his hands in the long tresses , pushing back the small , wispy curls that framed her face ."
"."
"`` my mother is dead , '' he said without emotion ."
"victoria instantly felt awful ."
"putting a hand out , she touched his shoulder , sure that the stiffness in his manner was because of his recent loss ."
"`` i 'm so sorry , mr. qudama ."
"i apologize for bringing it up ."
"it must have been hard for you , '' she said ."
"tears welled in her eyes as she looked up into his hard , unyielding ones ."
"`` i can see that you miss her , '' she said ."
"dharr 's hand stopped , not because he was finished but because he could no longer move ."
"the emotion clogging her voice and the tears in her eyes melted a small part of his heart that had been frozen for so long he had n't even known it existed ."
"why was this woman , this beautiful stranger , crying for his mother that had passed away when he was in his teens ?"
"he was thirty years old and long past needing his mother 's comforting arms , which she 'd never offered to begin with ."
"`` thank you , '' was all he could say ."
"victoria took the gauze from his hand and finished the task , wincing several times when she hit a particularly painful spot but persevering despite the pain ."
"when she was done , she looked up at him , smiling brightly ."
"`` well , that was n't so bad , i suppose , '' she replied and slid down off the gurney ."
"`` promise me something ? ''"
"she asked , picking up the mess and tossing it into the appropriate bins ."
"`` anything , '' dharr promised ."
"`` anything ? ''"
"she asked , turning back to him with another bright smile on her face and mischief twinkling in her eyes ."
"`` what if i ask for a new car or a castle ?"
"should n't you hear what i 'm asking before you promise the moon ? ''"
"dharr felt like chuckling since he could indeed deliver on anything she asked ."
"possibly not the moon , but even that might be within the realm of possibility in a few years ."
"`` okay , anything within reason ? ''"
"he said ."
"victoria nodded but then turned serious ."
"`` please do n't do anything about the man who accidentally knocked me down , '' she said ."
"`` it really wo n't be too bad . ''"
"dharr walked closer to her and touched her skin where a bruise was already forming ."
"`` how old are you ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria had to concentrate since his touch had driven all thoughts out of her mind ."
"`` uh ... twenty , '' she said ."
"`` only twenty ? ''"
"he asked , thinking he felt much older than his thirty years of age ."
"victoria blinked at his response , wondering if he thought her a child ."
"he was obviously much older than she was but felt it was important to point out that she was n't too young ."
"too young for what , she did n't let her mind define ."
"`` i do n't feel 'only ' anything ."
"besides , twenty is n't too young , '' she asserted strongly ."
"`` it is n't too young for what ? ''"
"he asked , and was delighted when she blushed again ."
"she glanced away but only for a moment , looking back up at him through her long lashes ."
"`` you 're teasing me , but really , i 'm not that young ."
"i 'm only two years away from graduation which at times feels like eternity but will come eventually . ''"
"he decided it would n't be gentlemanly to tease her more about her innocence ."
"`` what are you studying ? ''"
"he asked , changing the subject ."
"`` psychology . ''"
"`` and what do you want to do with a degree in psychology ? ''"
"`` help people , '' she said without hesitation ."
"`` help who ? ''"
"`` children probably , ' she said , smiling despite her nervousness ."
"`` they are wonderful little people but sometimes they are so vulnerable and misunderstood . ''"
"dharr stared at her lips , the need to bend down and taste them almost overwhelming ."
"but he resisted the urge and took a step back ."
"he needed to just forget about this woman and her refreshing honesty and spirit ."
"he had work to do and very little time to finish it before heading back to ashir ."
"`` now that you are cleaned up , may i give you a lift somewhere ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria snapped out of her dream were she was being kissed by the man ."
"he was probably married or seeing someone seriously ."
"no man this gorgeous and sexy could remain unattached ."
"she sat up straighter , testing her head tentatively by turning it from right to left ."
"when nothing happened , she shook her head in response to his offer ."
"`` no , thank you ."
"i 'm only a block away from my class , '' she said and gasped ."
"`` oh no !"
"my class ."
"i 'm going to be late , '' she said and hurried out of the room ."
"at the split in the curtains , she suddenly stopped and turned back to dharr ."
"`` thank you so much for your kindness , mr. qudama ."
"i 'm sorry to have been so silly by fainting on you . ''"
"dharr watched her rush over to a nurse , taking out her wallet ."
"the nurse quickly shook her head , obviously explaining that the hospital bill had already been paid ."
"he slipped out of the curtained area , following the signs to the exit where he knew his limousine was waiting ."
"it had been a refreshing interlude , but now it was over and he needed to get back to work ."
"once the nurse explained that one of the burly men with dharr had paid her bill already , victoria glanced back to the curtained area , intending to wave her thanks ."
"but the man was already gone ."
"her heart dropped and she felt like the sun had just left for the day , leaving only the heat and oppressive humidity ."
"walking out of the hospital , she looked up at the sunshine still beating down on the busy city sidewalks and sighed ."
"so much for life 's little fantasies , she thought ."
"stepping out onto the sidewalk , she made a determined stride towards her class ."
"it was a once a week class so it would last three hours today ."
"she 'd already missed the first hour but she could make it for the last two ."
"chapter 2 victoria buried her head in her hands when her suitemate arrived , full of vivacious energy ."
"`` hello ! ''"
"jasmine said , excitedly dancing into the shared sitting area ."
"`` what a beautiful day !"
"what are you doing studying ? ''"
"she asked , dumping her books onto a chair and taking a seat next to victoria ."
"being in their third year , they were in the suites instead of the dorm rooms ."
"that meant there were two bedrooms on either side of a small sitting area and a tiny kitchen ."
"no matter how much victoria tried to keep the areas cleaned up , jasmine was n't the most helpful ."
"but victoria loved the other woman 's spirit and vitality so she dealt with the negative side of jasmine while enjoying the fun side ."
"unfortunately , victoria did n't have time to deal with either side right at the moment ."
"she tried to hide her frustration at jasmine 's inability to understand victoria 's need for quiet ."
"victoria glanced up , smiling briefly at jasmine before looking back down at her book ."
"`` i have my mid term exams tomorrow in three classes ."
"do n't you ? ''"
"jasmine flopped dramatically into the kitchen , searching for and finding a soda and popping the can before bouncing back to the sofa ."
"`` goodness no !"
"i had my mid terms earlier this week so i 'm pretty much free ."
"but i 'll bet you need a little time alone , '' jasmine grinned ."
"victoria was instantly relieved that jasmine understood victoria 's predicament ."
"usually jasmine was a bit self-centered and would just ignore subtle as well as obvious hints for study time ."
"`` that would be lovely , '' victoria replied gratefully ."
"`` just call me if you need me to test you but you probably do n't need any more help ."
"knowing you , you 'll ace the exams with out any studying , '' she said , bouncing off the sofa and heading for her room ."
"a moment after the door to jasmine 's bedroom closed , the music started thumping loudly and victoria groaned in exasperation ."
"knowing how jasmine would sit in her room for hours reading or just listening to her music , victoria grasped that relief was no where in sight ."
"resignedly , she packed up her books and accepted that she 'd have to head to the library if she was to get any more studying done ."
"rushing out the door , victoria was tugging her bag over her shoulder and pulling the door to their suite closed at the same time when she ran into a solid brick wall ."
"`` oomph ! ''"
"strong arms reached out to stop her backwards fall while at the same time , she dropped her bag and reached out to grab hold of the brick wall ."
"when she was steady again and able to focus , she looked up ."
"then up higher again ."
"right into the eyes of dharr ."
"`` oh my ! ''"
"she gasped , her eyes widening and her cheeks blushing instantly ."
"`` oh my , indeed ."
"we really have to stop meeting like this , '' he said but his hands remained on her hips , holding her close ."
"victoria quickly released her hold and stepped back , her blush deepening when she realized she was holding onto him , and liking it ."
"the muscles she 'd felt under her hands were impressive and her fingers itched to feel them again , to be close and smell his aftershave which was spicy and masculine and just plain sexy ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' she said quickly , trying to hide her embarrassment ."
"`` i 'm not , '' dharr said , his eyes full of humor and appreciation for her beauty and refreshing innocence ."
"`` i just wish i could find a way to get closer without the possibility of marring such perfection , '' he said , one hand reaching out to touch the now purple area along her jaw ."
"victoria smiled but could n't hold his gaze ."
"`` oh , do n't worry about this , '' she said , waving the bruise aside ."
"`` i bruise easily , '' she said ."
"`` does it hurt ? ''"
"he asked , ignoring her attempt to ease his conscience ."
"she dared to glance at him , wondering if the tenderness she heard in his voice was reflected in his face ."
"it was n't but there was a softness in his eyes that had n't been there before ."
"`` not really , '' she lied ."
"it actually ached quite a bit ."
"dharr smiled slightly and touched her cheek again ."
"`` i wonder if you 're lying to protect me or the man who did this to you with his carelessness ? ''"
"victoria laughed nervously ."
"besides her mother , no one had been able to see through her quite so easily ."
"`` a little of both perhaps . ''"
"`` you have a tender heart , '' he replied ."
"then he looked around ."
"`` but what is that noise ?"
"is someone beating themselves ? ''"
"victoria listened for a moment and realized what he was hearing ."
"odd , but she 'd blocked out the rest of the world completely while he was touching her ."
"`` that ... ah ... is my roommate , '' she explained ."
"`` she 's listening to music . ''"
"dharr 's mouth thinned ."
"`` that 's not music , '' he declared ."
"`` it is simply noise ."
"and you are running from it yourself , are you not ? ''"
"`` yes , '' she admitted ."
"dharr studied her for a moment ."
"`` and you are too nice to ask her to turn it off ? ''"
"victoria shrugged ."
"she suspected that he would never hesitate to ask someone to turn down their music but it just was n't in her to ask someone to change when it was just as easy for her to leave the area ."
"`` it 's her suite as well , '' victoria justified ."
"`` and where will you go to escape the abhorrent noise ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` i was going over to the library to study , '' she said ."
"she suddenly looked up at him and asked , `` how did you find out where i lived ? ''"
"she knew she had n't given him her address , nor even where she was going to school ."
"it was odd that he had been able to track her down ."
"he looked at her for a long moment , considering his words ."
"`` i have many sources , '' was all he would say in response ."
"she watched his eyes , wishing she had the courage to ask more , but he was too intimidating ."
"and overwhelming ."
"`` well , i need to go , '' she finally said ."
"but she did n't move , still staring up into his magnificent , dark eyes ."
"`` have dinner with me tonight ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria instantly smiled , delighted at the possibility of spending more time with him ."
"`` really ? ''"
"dharr 's face actually smiled again ."
"`` really ."
"i would enjoy your company , '' he explained ."
"her smile faded a moment later ."
"`` is this just another way to try and pay me off ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` because it is n't necessary ."
"i promise , i wo n't sue you or your employee . ''"
"dharr actually laughed out loud ."
"`` the thought never even entered my mind , '' he said ."
"it was delightful to talk to someone who did n't have any idea of who he was ."
"the idea of someone suing the king of ashir was too ludicrous to contemplate ."
"but he was going to relish being just a man for as long as it lasted ."
"it was refreshing to see a woman 's reaction to him and him alone ."
"not his title nor his power or wealth ."
"it was also refreshing to see such innocence ."
"the women of his acquaintance were either bred specifically to entice him and therefore were taught in the ways of pleasing a man and his tastes therefore became theirs ."
"or they were already well versed in the ways of sex and only using him to find pleasure ."
"dharr avoided the first and encouraged the latter , enjoying the many women who threw themselves at him , seduced as much by himself as by the idea of having a liaison , no matter how short or long , with the king of ashir ."
"the title alone would guarantee him unlimited numbers of women ."
"and he was spoiled by their attentions ."
"but now , he was reveling in the anonymity of being with this one , young innocent woman who knew nothing about him other than that he was surrounded by body guards at times ."
"he almost dreaded the moment when she would find out who he was ."
"it would change everything ."
"until that moment , he determined that he would enjoy her company ."
"`` i guarantee that the thought had n't entered my mind ."
"i 'll pick you up at eight ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria could only nod in response ."
"she was having dinner with dharr !"
"just like in her dream last night and she suspected that it would be even better than her dream ."
"`` until tonight then , '' he said and bowed slightly before turning to leave ."
"victoria leaned her back against the dormitory wall , afraid her knees would give out on her ."
"she watched him walk away , his stride confident and commanding ."
"the other students actually moved out of the way as he approached , apparently seeing the same thing she did when he walked ."
"that man definitely knew how to take charge , she told herself ."
"he disappeared around the stairway corner and she was finally able to snap out of her dream-like trance ."
"she also noticed the bulky men step out from the shadows and follow him ."
"goodness , she thought , she had n't even been aware that they were standing there only a few feet away ."
"they really knew how to make themselves invisible ."
"it was a little terrifying to know that , whatever dharr did for a living , he needed that kind of protection wherever he went ."
"`` what are you doing standing there , tory-girl ? ''"
"scott mason asked ."
"scott was tall but not nearly as all as dharr ."
"he was also gangly where dharr was muscular and scott 's shoulders drooped as was the current fashion ."
"dharr was conservative elegance ."
"scott was the epitome of the latest fad ."
"scott was also very homosexual and proud of it ."
"and he was her best friend ."
"he was brilliant and going to be one of the best fashion designers the world has ever seen since chanel and yves saint laurent ."
"he was a genius at women 's fashions ."
"perhaps because he was a male who was n't interested in the female body as a sexual compliment , he was able to study the female body as an art form ."
"his designs were intriguing and creative , hiding any woman 's flaws and emphasizing her assets ."
"victoria had acted as a model for him on several occasions and therefore had several gorgeous outfits that he 'd created just for her ."
"victoria blinked at his sudden presence , then smiled brightly ."
"`` oh , scott !"
"i met the most amazing man yesterday . ''"
"`` you ?"
"the last virgin on earth ? ''"
"he laughed ."
"`` impossible . ''"
"`` possible ! ''"
"she laughed , ignoring his jibe about her sexual status ."
"`` and he 's incredibly gorgeous ! ''"
"`` hmmm ... any chance he might like me more than you ? ''"
"he suggested , nudging her with his shoulder in a teasing fashion ."
"`` back off , '' she laughed ."
"bending down , she picked up her book bag and headed down the stairs ."
"`` he 's taking me out to dinner tonight . ''"
"scott followed her along , thrilled that she 'd found someone she was interested in at last ."
"`` and what are you going to wear ? ''"
"he asked , excited about the prospect of showing off one if his latest designs ."
"victoria stopped in the middle of the stairway ."
"`` oh no !"
"scott , what am i going to wear ? ''"
"she asked , suddenly nervous ."
"`` i ca n't go out with someone like dharr ."
"he 's so out of my league , '' she said , her hand going up to cover her forehead ."
"`` he 's champagne and i 'm ... .. '' she struggled to find the appropriate words , `` tap water , '' she finally said ."
"scott laughed out loud ."
"`` you 're kidding , right ? ''"
"he asked , looking down at her delicate beauty blocking the staircase ."
"other students were slipping around them so scott pulled her over to the side ."
"he saw that many of the men watched her for as long as possible , their eyes straying to her legs or any part of her sexy , petite frame ."
"and she had absolutely no idea that they were doing it ."
"she was the most un-vain woman he 'd ever met ."
"victoria bowed her head in frustration and anxiety ."
"`` no ."
"i 'm not ."
"you should see him , scott !"
"he 's fabulous !"
"and gorgeous and i suspect he 's relatively rich so what in the world could i possibly offer a man like that ? ''"
"scott shook his head , amazed that this gorgeous woman did n't understand her worth ."
"she was sweet and sensitive with a deep understanding of other people 's happiness and sadness ."
"the happiness she encouraged and the sadness , she was able tease them out of ."
"she was the most beautiful woman inside he 'd ever had the pleasure of knowing ."
"and outside , she was an absolute knockout whose figure he used to display his designs to perfection ."
"`` do n't you worry about what to wear when i 'm around , '' he admonished ."
"`` and as for the other , you just be yourself and he 'll fall in love with you harder than you could ever imagine . ''"
"victoria smiled ."
"`` really ? ''"
"she asked , remembering saying that to dharr only a few minutes ago ."
"`` really ."
"now if that bulging book bag is any indication , then you probably have midterms tomorrow , eh ? ''"
"after she nodded , scott suggested , `` then come along darling and while you 're studying , i 'll dream up other lovely creations to cover those magnificent breasts with , '' he said , laughing when he received the expected blush ."
"`` you 're bad , scott , '' she admonished ."
"`` but i 'll take you up on your offer as long as rudy is n't here ."
"is he still visiting his parents in ireland ? ''"
"she asked , referring to scott 's boyfriend ."
"he was nice enough but liked to talk when victoria needed quiet time to study and worry about tonight ."
"`` he is so do n't worry ."
"plenty of quiet at my place , '' he assured her ."
"victoria spent the rest of the afternoon studying , forcing thoughts of dharr out of her mind until six o'clock when scott demanded that she stop and get ready ."
"`` i have to do your hair , dearie ."
"because if i know you , and i do , '' he teased , `` then you 're just going to brush it and leave it down , right ? ''"
"`` that was the plan , yes , '' she said , closing her book and tucking it into her book bag ."
"`` not going to work , '' he said ."
"`` not if you 're going to wear this , '' he said and pulled a creamy white , beaded dress out of the closet ."
"`` what do you think ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria gasped in delight ."
"`` scott !"
"it is wonderful , '' she said ."
"getting up , she walked over to the dress and touched the glittering sequins that danced all over the fabric in a creative design ."
"there were flat sequins as well as drop beads that created an almost flighty feeling ."
"the white would look perfect with her soft , brown hair and creamy skin ."
"`` when did you make this ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` no time for flattery ."
"just hop into the shower and then come out here ."
"and just please tell me you are n't wearing your usual plain , white underwear . ''"
"victoria blushed ."
"`` of course ! ''"
"scott sighed ."
"`` do n't you have anything else ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"`` no !"
"besides , dharr is n't going to see my underwear tonight anyway , '' she claimed and slipped into the bathroom ."
"`` pity , '' scott said , noting her perfect derriere , which was the last thing he saw before the bathroom door closed ."
"while she 'd been in the shower , scott had called over to jasmine to explain the situation and ask that she bring over some makeup ."
"an hour and a half later , scott put the final touches on her hair ."
"he 'd demanded that she blow dry her hair , then he curled the ends so her hair floated around her shoulders like a soft , brown cloud ."
"the dress was the perfect foil for her figure , enhancing her tiny waist and pushing her breasts higher ."
"her cleavage was showing over the neckline , making her breasts look larger than they really were ."
"and since she was n't small breasted in the first place , they became quite obvious in the dress ."
"chapter 3 victoria stared at her reflection in the mirror and was astonished ."
"she 'd modeled many dresses for scott before , some more daring than this one ."
"but she 'd only been in front of a camera when she 'd worn them ."
"she 'd never before been about to embark on a date with a man so much more worldly than she was ."
"`` scott , are you sure about this dress ? ''"
"she asked , pulling up the top and trying to flatten out her breasts ."
"`` is n't it too ... .revealing ? ''"
"she finished ."
"`` absolutely , '' he said , smiling in the mirror ."
"`` it looks great , '' jasmine exclaimed ."
"`` i still think you should wear more makeup ."
"just a touch of liner to your eyes would make them look bigger , smokier ."
"very sexy , you know . ''"
"victoria shook her head ."
"`` that 's not really me , jasmine , '' she said , smiling to soften the rejection ."
"jasmine sighed and shook her head ."
"`` i know ."
"i 'd just like to meet this guy ."
"you 've never been excited about the men i 've set you up with ."
"what 's so great about this one ? ''"
"she asked , smiling and settling down with a glass of wine that scott handed her ."
"scott rolled his eyes and poured a glass for himself , not bothering to offer one to victoria although he thought she needed one just to calm herself down ."
"`` you should know that victoria would n't be interested in the men you bring around , jasmine ."
"just look at them and then look at her ."
"all the men you introduce her to have body piercings ."
"does victoria really look like someone who would be interested in someone like that ? ''"
"jasmine looked at her sweet , innocent looking suitemate and sighed , knowing that scott had a point ."
"`` eh , you 've got to try them all on , you know , before you settle down with one of them . ''"
"scott took a sip of wine before responding to jasmine 's latest philosophy for her life ."
"`` that 's another thing , victoria does n't try them on ."
"she barely even tastes them . ''"
"victoria laughed , knowing how the discussion was heading since it had all been said before ."
"`` stop ."
"you both make me sound like a frigid old maid ."
"i 'm not quite on the shelf yet , you know . ''"
"scott eyed victoria in the dress ."
"`` we can only hope that this dharr person takes you down from the shelf , dearie ."
"i 'm telling you , you 're missing out on a lot of fun . ''"
"victoria shivered in excitement at the idea of dharr 'taking her off the shelf ' , so to speak ."
"`` well , i 'm glad you both wo n't be accompanying me tonight ."
"i shudder at the idea of what you would suggest during dinner . ''"
"`` as long as you 're shuddering , dear , that 's all we care about , '' scott said ."
"jasmine clinked glasses with him , chuckling at their turn of phrase ."
"victoria just rolled her eyes and picked up her books ."
"`` i 'm heading out ."
"i 'll see you later , '' she called out as she left the dorm ."
"she had only five more minutes before dharr was supposed to be picking her up at her dorm ."
"she 'd have to hurry to get back there in time ."
"she reached her dorm just as dharr was walking up the steps ."
"`` hello ! ''"
"she said , slightly breathless from rushing across campus in high heeled shoes and the two flights of stairs ."
"`` let me just drop my bag inside and grab my purse , '' she said ."
"`` you look lovely , '' he said and watched her rush across the room , enjoying again her refreshing innocence ."
"he questioned his instincts yet again ."
"his mind was telling him that she was pure but he could n't understand how someone with so lush a figure could not know a man 's body ."
"it was inconceivable to him ."
"but he was going to enjoy the illusion for a while ."
"`` thank you , '' she said and turned to face him , looking down as she picked up a small beaded purse ."
"the purse did n't really match the dress but it was the only evening bag she owned ."
"it would just have to do , she told herself ."
"`` i 'm ready , '' she claimed ."
"`` i hope so , '' he said and offered his arm ."
"victoria placed her hand on his arm and smiled shyly , his words echoing in her mind as she tried to translate them ."
"finally , she just enjoyed the delicious feeling of touching his arm , wondering what it would be like to kiss him , have him kiss her back ."
"dinner that night was incredible for victoria ."
"she was from a small village and , prior to dinner with dharr , attending university in london had been the most amazing thing to have happen to her ."
"but being in the expensive restaurant , surrounded by the movers and shakers of london society , victoria tried to hide her awe for fear of looking like a silly , country girl in front of dharr who seemed completely at home in the environment ."
"the menu was in french and , although she could speak it conversationally , with dharr sitting across from her , the menu might as well be in swahili ."
"`` would you like me to order for you ? ''"
"he suggested , noting her nervousness and assuming it was because she could n't read the words ."
"`` yes , that would be lovely , '' she said , laying her menu to the side and sighing with relief ."
"now she could hide her shaking hands under the table ."
"dharr ordered in perfect , fluent french , ordering a bottle of champagne that , if victoria had been more worldly , she 'd know cost over a thousand dollars a bottle ."
"she knew he ordered her a salad and himself a beef dish and she tried not to cringe ."
"she hated salad but thought it was what he expected her to prefer ."
"and since she had n't had the temerity to order for herself , she deserved what she got ."
"`` tell me about yourself , '' he commanded when the waiter was gone ."
"victoria took a breadstick and smiled ."
"`` what would you like to know ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` everything . ''"
"`` everything ? ''"
"she teased ."
"`` is n't that a lot for a first date ? ''"
"`` absolutely ."
"so start talking , '' he commanded ."
"but she saw the humor in his eyes so she did n't take offense ."
"`` well , as i mentioned yesterday , i 'm twenty years old and am attending the university of london on scholarship ."
"i 'm studying psychology but considering making my focus children 's psychology . ''"
"`` why ? ''"
"`` because they seem like the most misunderstood part of the population ."
"they ca n't always express themselves so they act out in sometimes violent ways ."
"most people do n't even try to interpret their actions . ''"
"`` and what if the child is just innately bad ? ''"
"she shook her head in disagreement ."
"`` there is no such thing , '' she said adamantly ."
"`` any child that is lashing out is just in pain and we 've caused it . ''"
"`` we ? ''"
"he challenged ."
"`` are you including everyone or just the child 's parents ? ''"
"her grin was impish as she looked across the table at him ."
"`` oh , i 'm not that nice ."
"i think we as a society are all responsible . ''"
"`` what about the parents that are bad behind closed doors and we do n't know about it ? ''"
"`` usually people know ."
"children give off signals and if we choose to ignore them , well then we reap what we sow ? ''"
"`` and what about the men in your life ? ''"
"he asked changing the subject ."
"victoria understood that he disagreed with her on her child psychology but that was okay ."
"not everyone needed to agree with everyone else ."
"diversity was what made the world work in wonderful ways , she told herself ."
"`` i do n't currently have a boyfriend but my suitemate , jasmine , is constantly setting me up with men she thinks would suit me wonderfully . ''"
"`` and what kind of man does she think is suitable for someone like you ? ''"
"victoria 's head tilted slightly to the side ."
"`` what kind of a woman do you think i am ? ''"
"dharr leaned closer and took her hand , drawing circles on the palm while his eyes held hers hostage ."
"`` i think you 're younger than your twenty years in some ways , older in others ."
"and i think you 're idealistic which is sad because you 're going to be disappointed when you enter the real world after college ."
"but you 're strong and will survive ."
"and i think you 're going to be in my bed soon . ''"
"victoria could barely breathe ."
"his thumb was tracing patterns on her palm and moved slowly up to her wrist , sending shivers through her entire system ."
"she tried to pull her hand from his but he would n't release it ."
"and he continued to stare at her eyes , seeing the fear that entered them with his words ."
"`` you do n't have to be afraid of me , victoria ."
"i promise you that anything you do with me , you wo n't regret . ''"
"`` how can you promise something like that ? ''"
"`` because i 'll make it so , '' he said , arrogance reeking from his body ."
"`` relax , '' he said ."
"`` i ca n't with you doing that to my hand . ''"
"`` then you feel it too ? '"
"he asked ."
"`` feel what ? ''"
"dharr allowed a half smile , wondering if she was serious or just pretending ."
"because he was so cynical , he half considered calling her on the issue ."
"but the other half of him wanted to play along , let her either play the game or let him determine that she was the real thing ."
"he pulled his hand away and sat back ."
"`` never mind , '' he replied , noting the confusion in her eyes ."
"she was either the real thing or she was the best actress he 'd ever met ."
"`` tell me about your classes . ''"
"they talked throughout the dinner and eventually victoria was able to relax ."
"dharr made her laugh more than she had in years and she 'd never talked so much in her life ."
"but each time she questioned him , he simply reverted back to asking her questions ."
"by the end of the night when he was walking her to her door , she knew no more about him than she did when she left the hospital the day before ."
"`` i 'm going to kiss you , '' dharr said , turning her to face him in the dimly lit hallway ."
"it was around midnight so the students who were partying were still out for another few hours and the ones who had settled in earlier were already asleep ."
"they were relatively alone in the hallway and the realization sped up victoria 's heart rate ."
"`` that would be nice , '' she whispered but she was shaking all over ."
"she did n't even know what to do with her hands ."
"she 'd been kissed in the past , but it had been selfish kisses where the men simply put their mouths on hers without any permission or signal from her ."
"each time , she 'd waited for some feeling to stir within her but had been left cold and had pulled away before anything serious started ."
"now , standing here with dharr looking down at her , she felt young and foolish , unsure of what to do to encourage him or how to even start the kiss she wanted so badly ."
"thankfully , he took matters into his own hands ."
"he took her hands in his and pulled her closer , settling his own large , strong hands on her waist , leaving hers to flutter around his chest before finally settling down on his lapels ."
"she looked up under her lashes , wondering why he was taking so long but the desire she saw in his eyes almost scared her ."
"she was about to pull back when his hands pulled her forward ."
"their bodies touched and she gasped at the intensity of feeling ."
"there was heat surging through her stomach , pooling at the core of her being and melting her insides ."
"her surprised eyes glanced up at his but all thought disappeared when his lips touched hers ."
"they were gentle at first , then more pressure , touching , caressing , instant ache settling inside her ."
"`` open your mouth , victoria , '' dharr groaned ."
"his hand lifted from her waist to touch her chin , his thumb pulling her chin down so her mouth opened ."
"instantly , his tongue entered her mouth , mating with hers , absorbing her gasp with his mouth as he increased the pressure ."
"his tongue moved in and out , imitating the mating that his body was craving to do with hers right at this moment ."
"his mind told him to slow down , not to scare her but to gently teach her how to kiss since she was obviously unschooled in the art ."
"but his body was painfully hard , aching to push into her soft flesh and find the release he knew instinctively would be better than anything he 'd ever experienced ."
"with incredible determination , dharr found the resources within him to pull back , to slow down and give her room to breathe ."
"it was n't what he wanted , but he knew that the next step would terrify her ."
"he did n't want her scared ."
"he wanted her to learn step by step how to please him and for her to teach him how to please her ."
"it would n't be accomplished in one night ."
"so he pulled back and lifted his head , noting with satisfaction that her eyes were still closed and her hands were gripping his lapels ."
"victoria took a long , shuddering breath and opened her eyes to find dharr staring down into her own ."
"the desire she 'd seen before was still there but there was something more , something stronger ."
"her mind would n't comprehend anything at the moment but she accepted that the mind-shattering kiss was over ."
"closing her mouth , she hid her disappointment and slowly released her hold on his suit , feeling embarrassed that she had n't even realized she 'd been doing that ."
"`` have dinner with me again tomorrow night ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria thought frantically ."
"she had mid term exams tomorrow but she 'd be finished by the late afternoon ."
"`` okay , but it is my turn to treat you , '' she said ."
"he was astonished that she would even suggest something like treating him to dinner ."
"although no one had done that in the past , not even suggested such a thing , it warmed his heart that she should be the first ."
"`` no need , '' dharr replied ."
"`` but i insist ."
"i promise , nothing fancy but you 'll like it ."
"i hope , '' she said , biting her lip in indecision ."
"she loved to cook and experiment with foods but could she compete with the gourmet meals he was obviously used to ?"
"it worried her for only a moment but then her sense of fairness came back ."
"he 'd bought her dinner tonight , it was her turn and she would just do her best ."
"dharr looked at her , noting her excitement and enthusiasm , considering his options ."
"he could insist that he buy her dinner again since it was obvious she could n't afford to buy him dinner ."
"or he could find out what she had in mind and possibly learn more about her at the same time ."
"since he wanted to know everything about this tiny , beautiful and , he suspected , sensitive woman , he gave in to her request this time ."
"`` as you wish ."
"what time ? ''"
"`` about seven ? ''"
"she smiled impishly , `` i 'd offer to pick you up but i do n't have a car and i do n't think you 'd like riding the tube with me ."
"so you 'll just have to meet me somewhere . ''"
"dharr laughed , appalled at the idea of riding on public transportation ."
"not only would he never deign to do it , the security issues it would involve if he ever did would horrify his body guards ."
"`` i 'll pick you up here at seven thirty . ''"
"victoria smiled tentatively ."
"`` okay , but would you mind if i met you in the parking lot ? ''"
"dharr did n't like the ghost of apprehension which entered her beautiful green eyes as she asked this question ."
"and it went against his sense of propriety for her to not be picked up and escorted properly ."
"because of where he was hoping their relationship was going , he felt the need to treat her with every dignity and respect she deserved as his future wife ."
"for other women he 'd been with in the past , he never would have extended the courtesy of picking them up at their door ."
"and the fact that victoria was scorning this small indication of his respect for her annoyed him ."
"`` why ? ''"
"she saw the annoyance on his face and worried about it , but stood firm in her desire to hide their relationship until she understood it better ."
"`` because i 'm afraid my friends might start asking me questions and right now , i do n't have any answers . ''"
"her response made him feel somewhat better but he still wanted more explanation ."
"`` what kinds of questions ? ''"
"victoria shrugged her shoulders slightly , smiling up at him as she said , `` oh , simple things , like your last name , what you do for a living , where you live ."
"you know , minor details . ''"
"`` i told you my last name yesterday . ''"
"victoria looked down at her hands which were clasped in front of her ."
"`` i know , but i could n't remember it ."
"so when my suitemate asked me today , i could n't answer and it was embarrassing ."
"and over dinner , i noticed that you did n't answer any questions ."
"besides , the men you have waiting downstairs for you are a little scary ."
"i do n't know if all those bulges are muscles and i do n't want to know , '' she said when he was about to answer her ."
"`` there are some things that are better left to the imagination . ''"
"he nodded although he was amused at her fear of his body guards and their weapons ."
"dharr faced reality head on , knowing that the world was not a nice place and anticipating issues ."
"victoria obviously preferred to see the world as much nicer than it really was ."
"`` fair enough ."
"and tomorrow , you can ask me anything you 'd like . ''"
"she looked up at him ."
"`` and will you answer me ? ''"
"dharr laughed ."
"`` if it is the right question . ''"
"she had to laugh back , amazed yet again at his arrogance ."
"`` fair enough . ''"
"`` goodnight , victoria , '' he said and touched her bruised cheek gently ."
"he took her key and unlocked the door for her before handing it back to her ."
"`` sweet dreams . ''"
"victoria watched him walk away for a moment ."
"`` one more thing , dharr , '' she called out ."
"he turned at the top of the stair well ."
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"victoria bit her lip , wondering if she could actually ask the question ."
"`` would you mind if you ... well , did n't wear a suit tomorrow ?"
"it might get a little dirty . ''"
"dharr grinned but nodded his head ."
"`` if that is your wish , '' he said ."
"chapter 4 victoria nervously slid her hands down the sides of her khaki slacks and white tee-shirt ."
"the picnic basket was by her feet and she had a blanket on top of it ."
"would dharr think this was a silly idea ?"
"she hoped not ."
"she did n't have a lot of money and a simple meal was the most elaborate thing she could think of ."
"she even knew of a wonderful place by the thames in a park only a few miles away ."
"they could just sit on the grass away from everyone else and simply enjoy the night descending ."
"thankfully , it was a little cooler tonight with the promise of fall scenting the air ."
"the leaves had n't started changing yet but they would in another few weeks ."
"she saw the limousine turn into the parking lot and her heart instantly sped up in anticipation of seeing dharr ."
"absently , she wondered how long this feeling of excitement would last ."
"she 'd felt it for a few other dates , until the end of the dates , that is when they tried kissing her by mashing their mouths against hers ."
"that 's when the feeling had ended ."
"so had the relationship ."
"the long , black car pulled up right next to her and victoria smiled and opened the back door just as a man was getting out of the front seat , possibly to open the car for her ."
"she simply waved to the man and picked up the basket and blanket , then disappeared into the back seat ."
"sitting down next to dharr , she noted the frown on his face ."
"`` good evening ! ''"
"she said ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"`` you should wait for the door to be opened for you , victoria , '' he admonished ."
"she looked at the now closed door and blinked ."
"`` why ? ''"
"she asked , turning back to face him ."
"`` because you are a lady ."
"a gentleman opens the door for her . ''"
"victoria knew he was serious but she could n't help laughing ."
"`` that 's silly when i 'm perfectly capable of opening the door for myself ."
"`` regardless , you will permit my guards to open the doors for you in the future , '' he ordered ."
"her smile disappeared and she nodded her head ."
"`` of course , if that 's what you want , '' she said quietly ."
"dharr instantly lightened ."
"`` thank you ."
"but this is what i want , '' he said and pulled her forward ."
"victoria had thought he wanted just a small kiss , like her father would give to her mother occasionally ."
"but dharr pulled her onto his lap and lowered his head to hers ."
"his mouth touched hers and within a moment , his hand was pulling her chin down , just as he had the previous night and his tongue dipped into her mouth ."
"victoria 's mind went blank and her whole body was reacting to instinctive feelings ."
"her body arched against his ."
"she heard a moan but did n't realize it was her as his mouth took over hers , his tongue exploring her mouth and making her dizzy with unexpected and unfamiliar feelings ."
"dharr pulled back slightly ."
"`` put your tongue in my mouth , '' he said ."
"`` do as i do . ''"
"his mouth came back to hers and she needed no prompting this time to open to him ."
"and when his tongue touched hers , she tentatively moved her tongue back , imitating his movements and the feelings that had been building only intensified as she learned to participate in the kiss and not just accept it ."
"absently , she felt his hands on her back but they did n't move even though her body was clamoring for him to touch hers ."
"she moved her hands from his shoulders , nervously touching his neck , desperate to touch his skin in some way ."
"when her fingertips touched his skin , she felt the heat of his body and they skittered away after just the simple touch , afraid he might get angry if she went any further ."
"she heard his chuckle deep in his throat and pulled back , her eyes questioning and worried that he 'd felt her touch and was laughing at her ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' she said , wanting to move off his lap in embarrassment ."
"but he stopped her movement and rested his hands on the sides of her hips ."
"`` victoria , please touch me anywhere you 'd like , '' he said and pulled her right hand so it was touching his neck , her fingers tickling his hair ."
"she immediately pulled her hand away but he just laughed again and put it right back against his neck ."
"`` if you do n't touch me , victoria , i 'm going to die , '' he said and pulled her back against his body ."
"`` and believe me , i 'm going to touch you , '' he said a moment before his mouth bent to kiss her again ."
"but his hands did n't move anywhere other than her hips and waist while her hands felt free to explore his skin , his hair , touching him anywhere she could find his skin and reveled in the amazing feeling of him ."
"he was like rough velvet , if that was a possible description ."
"and his hair was soft and light to her touch ."
"she loved his hair , feeling so different from hers ."
"dharr enjoyed the painful feeling of wanting victoria , knowing he could do nothing about it ."
"if anything showed him that she really was a virgin , it was her tentative touching and inexperience with kissing ."
"finally he ended the kiss and pulled back , smiling down at her ."
"`` where are we going ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria sat up straight and looked out the windows , noting the buildings of london as they passed by ."
"`` where are we going ? ''"
"`` my driver has just been driving around aimlessly , waiting for direction from me ."
"or more specifically , you . ''"
"victoria slid off his lap , grateful that he did n't stop her this time ."
"`` you mean he ... .dharr please tell me he is n't suspecting that we 're back here kissing ! ''"
"she exclaimed , her hands covering her mouth and her face turning the becoming shade of red he was coming to expect now ."
"dharr did n't think she 'd appreciate the fact that his driver and the guards that were in the front seat , not to mention the ones that were following in the suv behind him , would assume that he was doing much more than kissing ."
"`` they are busy watching the road , i 'm sure , '' he replied ."
"that made her feel better ."
"`` well , in that case , can you ask them to drive us over to the park by the thames ?"
"there 's a nice little spot where i can ask you all sorts of questions without being interrupted . ''"
"dharr picked up the phone and spoke in a foreign language , then just as quickly hung up again ."
"when he was done , he turned back to her expectantly ."
"`` how were your exams today ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she was flattered that he remembered her telling him about her exams ."
"`` fine , i think ."
"i wo n't know for another week . ''"
"`` what happens in a week ? ''"
"`` i get my grades , '' she laughed ."
"`` ah ."
"my mistake ."
"i 'm sure you did well on them , '' he said ."
"`` i feel pretty good about them ."
"i think i 'll do okay . ''"
"she looked at him tentatively ."
"`` where did you go to university ? ''"
"`` oxford , '' he replied without hesitation ."
"victoria was impressed ."
"and since he 'd answered that one so quickly , she felt brave enough to ask more questions ."
"`` what do you do for a living ? ''"
"`` various things , '' he said honestly ."
"well that was a non-answer if she 'd ever heard one ."
"she smiled , hoping he would elaborate ."
"`` such as ? ''"
"dharr hesitated ."
"he was still enjoying the anonymity of her not knowing about his title or power ."
"he considered all the things he could tell her and settled on the least revealing without lying to her ."
"`` i 'm currently in london negotiating oil contracts . ''"
"`` ah !"
"that explains a lot . ''"
"`` what does it explain ? ''"
"`` your ... aura of power , '' she said ."
"`` i know that sounds silly but you just have a sense about you ."
"like you 're used to being in charge . ''"
"dharr did n't respond but was impressed with her senses ."
"obviously she was more alert than he 'd given her credit for ."
"`` what else do you want to know about me ? ''"
"`` what 's it like negotiating oil leases ? ''"
"`` sometimes it can be difficult , depending on who is negotiating . ''"
"`` who are you negotiating with right now ? ''"
"`` the british government . ''"
"`` ah , '' she said , suddenly a little intimidated by his power ."
"`` where did you grow up ? ''"
"she asked , changing the subject ."
"he hesitated before answering , wondering if his answer would give him away ."
"`` in ashir . ''"
"`` wow !"
"what was that like ?"
"i 've heard that some parts of the country are pretty dangerous . ''"
"`` actually , the crime rate is lower in ashir than in great britain . ''"
"her head tilted to the side as she tried to remember her history lessons ."
"`` is n't the government a monarchy ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"`` do you think that will change ?"
"do n't the people want a more democratic state ? ''"
"he choked on his laugh , her suggestion treasonous in his mind since he was the head of the government of ashir ."
"`` i hope not . ''"
"victoria smiled slightly , understanding his statement ."
"`` i 'm guessing from your response that you work for the government ? ''"
"dharr laughed outright now and noted that they were pulling up at the park ."
"`` we 're here , '' he said , avoiding having to tell her that he was at the top of the government ."
"victoria picked up the picnic basket and blanket but they were instantly taken out of her hands ."
"`` you wo n't carry this , '' dharr said and handed it to the waiting guard behind her ."
"victoria 's heart sank ."
"she was hoping for a little privacy but now realized that the guards would probably be following them the entire time ."
"`` do they have to come along ? ''"
"she whispered to him as she led the way down the path ."
"`` i 'm afraid that they must always be with me , '' he explained ."
"`` they are a necessary evil . ''"
"she glanced at the five burly men surrounding them ."
"`` i did n't realize that negotiating oil leases was so dangerous . ''"
"`` there are many people who would prefer that i not be around , '' he said ."
"`` you 're probably a pretty tough dictator , '' she laughed ."
"`` i can imagine you laying down the oil price and not moving a smidge . ''"
"`` you think so ? ''"
"he laughed , uncomfortable with the conversation ."
"he wanted to steer it away from himself but knew that he 'd promised to answer her questions ."
"he knew he could n't answer them completely but would give her small glimpses into his life ."
"`` what else do you want to know ? ''"
"everything she thought to herself ."
"she wanted to know how this man woke up in the morning , what he did all day long and how he 'd become the incredible man he was today ."
"she ignored the other niggling questions like , was he dating other people besides her ?"
"or had he ever been in love before ?"
"those questions hurt her , deep inside somewhere she did n't want to explore ."
"she also did n't think she had the right to ask them ."
"this was only their third meeting and one did n't really count since it was an accident ."
"`` how did you learn to negotiate oil leases ?"
"what got you into the business ? ''"
"she asked the most mundane first , wondering how much of himself he would reveal ."
"`` it runs in the family , '' he answered ."
"it was the truth in a sense but not the way she 'd been asking the question ."
"he 'd inherited his title from his father , and therefore all the responsibilities of running ashir along with the title ."
"negotiating oil leases was just one of the activities that fell to him as the king ."
"he did n't negotiate all of them , only the very large contracts with large countries since politics and treaties were usually involved as well ."
"the smaller countries or companies were delegated to others within the government ."
"`` how about that spot over there , '' she said , pointing to an area that was surrounded by trees but still had a grassy spot that looked out onto the thames ."
"he looked back to his guards who nodded imperceptibly ."
"turning back to victoria , he nodded ."
"`` that is fine , '' he said ."
"victoria took the blanket from the guard , smiling her thanks at him and spread it out on the ground ."
"dharr had the picnic basket and took her hand to help her onto the blanket ."
"she laid out the ingredients to the picnic and looked up , surprised to find that they were completely alone ."
"or so it seemed ."
"`` where are your guards ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` they are near but out of sight . ''"
"he sat down next to her and looked at the food ."
"`` did you make all this ? ''"
"he asked , touched to see that there were homemade cookies and freshly cut fruit ."
"`` did you make these ? ''"
"he asked , picking up a cookie to sample ."
"victoria was busy setting out the other items she 'd made for their dinner and glanced up to see him holding a lemon cookie curiously ."
"`` yes ."
"do you like lemon ? ''"
"she asked tentatively ."
"they were her favorite kind of cookie but she knew some people did n't really like lemon or the sweetness of these kinds of cookies ."
"they were lemon cookies with a very sweet lemon frosting on them ."
"victoria knew she had a horrible sweet tooth and liked things extra sweet ."
"`` i do ."
"i just do n't think ... . ''"
"he stopped , glanced at her and smiled before popping the cookie into his mouth ."
"his eyes widened in surprise and delight as he tasted the rich , sweet cookie ."
"`` this is delicious , '' he said and picked up another one ."
"victoria 's face brightened and she felt a warm glow spread through her system ."
"`` i 'm glad you like them , '' she said and pushed the bowl containing the rest closer to him ."
"she glanced off to the side nervously then busily prepared the roasted chicken on a plate for him along with potato salad and freshly sliced peaches ."
"when he popped three more into his mouth , she laughed ."
"`` you 're going to ruin your appetite for dinner , '' she admonished ."
"`` what else is there ? ''"
"he asked , sneaking one more cookie before taking the plate she offered ."
"victoria moved so she could check behind him , then glanced down ."
"`` i made garlic chicken and potato salad ."
"but i did n't put celery in the salad ."
"i hate celery ."
"i hope you do n't mind . ''"
"`` potato salad ? ''"
"he asked , moving his plastic fork around on the plate to investigate the white mass of potato salad she 'd just put there ."
"victoria stopped her search for his guards and blinked at him , her green eyes astonished as she watched him move the potato salad around , sniff it , then take a taste ."
"`` have you never had potato salad ? ''"
"she asked ."
"dharr shook his head ."
"`` i 've never had a homemade cookie , i suppose you could say ."
"this is a night of firsts for me . ''"
"that was too odd ."
"`` what do you mean ?"
"did n't your mother make cookies for holidays or company ? ''"
"dharr chuckled ."
"`` i do n't think my mother knew where the kitchen was , '' he said honestly ."
"`` she would simply tell her assistant who would be attending any given function and her assistant would tell the chef . ''"
"victoria swallowed with difficulty ."
"`` you had a chef ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` and your mother had a personal assistant ? ''"
"she 'd known he was wealthy but that statement put him into a whole different realm ."
"and the idea of never making cookies with a parent made her feel sad ."
"`` i 'm sorry you did n't make cookies , '' she said , putting her plate down onto her lap , her eyes expressing her sympathy for a childhood devoid of a wonderful bonding experience with a parent ."
"`` did you ever wish you could ? ''"
"dharr 's black eyes looked up at hers and he almost laughed ."
"but the sincerity he saw there made him stop ."
"she really felt bad for him ?"
"he ran a finger gently down her un-bruised cheek and smiled ."
"`` i did n't know i was missing anything significant ."
"none of my friends ever had the experience either so do n't feel bad for me . ''"
"victoria could see the humor in his eyes and felt silly suddenly ."
"obviously he had a completely different upbringing than she did ."
"`` well , how about the potato salad ."
"do you like it ? ''"
"dharr took a bite skeptically ."
"but again , his eyes showed his surprise at the savory bite of potato in a creamy , garlic sauce ."
"`` it 's delicious ."
"where did you get it ? ''"
"`` i made it silly ."
"you ca n't really buy good potato salad ."
"besides , most places put celery in it and , as i said , i hate celery . ''"
"she took a bite and glanced behind her again ."
"dharr caught her nervous look and sighed ."
"placing the plate beside him , he took her hand in his ."
"`` victoria , i ca n't send them away ."
"but i promise you that they are well hidden and are looking outwards and definitely not looking at us . ''"
"victoria sighed and her shoulders drooped ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"we 're obviously from different worlds ."
"you have guards and chefs and personal assistants ."
"i have a messy kitchen and a suitemate with loud tastes in awful music . ''"
"`` ah , but you 're looking at the things that are different but consider the things that draw us together . ''"
"`` i ca n't really see many of those , '' she laughed ."
"`` i see you 're beautiful eyes , and a mouth i 've been wanting to kiss ever since we sat down ."
"i see you 're lovely ... '' he was about to say breasts but changed his mind , afraid she would n't appreciate his comment , `` hands that have made this delicious meal for me and i feel honored . ''"
"victoria smiled , suddenly glad she had gone to so much trouble ."
"she had heard the hesitation in his voice and a part of her wondered what he had been about to say , but then his lips touched hers and all her thoughts flew away ."
"she leaned forward , wanting to kiss him as well ."
"dharr wanted to pull her across the blanket and lay her down , covering her gorgeous body with his and feel her softness against his hard frame ."
"but he held back , knowing he would have to go slowly or frighten her away ."
"she was obviously untutored in the art of lovemaking and he 'd have to take it step by step ."
"she had been skittish about kissing him yesterday ."
"what could he teach her today , he wondered ."
"the ideas flashed through his mind but he pulled back , appreciating the heightened color on her translucent skin ."
"her eyes opened slowly , revealing the desire she was feeling ."
"it felt good to know that he had put it there , and better that she was too inexperienced to hide her feelings , or her reaction to his touch ."
"being decisive was one of the reasons his rule over ashir had been so successful over the past five years ."
"he gathered information and made decisions usually without the consent of his advisors ."
"initially they were furious that he would push them aside except when making the more important decisions , but over the years , he had proven that his actions had been beneficial ."
"his advisors have backed down , with only a few concerns floating around occasionally ."
"now , looking at victoria 's flushed face and her incredible green eyes that could hide nothing from him , he made the decision that he would marry her ."
"it would take a great deal of training , he knew , to teach her to be a proper queen ."
"she 'd be marrying into an already established system with conservative values ."
"but the fact that she was a virgin , and he did n't doubt that anymore , would put her in a good position to learn what was right and wrong within ashiri customs ."
"she would eventually mould herself and become a good ashiri bride and queen ."
"he would teach some things , like how he wanted her in bed and he could hire tutors to teach her the rest ."
"his mind was already making plans , considering the arguments of marrying a foreigner and coming up with arguments against them ."
"he would have her , he knew ."
"how long ?"
"he decided six months ."
"he would give her two months to get used to him and then he would propose to her ."
"that would give her four months to prepare and learn as much as possible before the wedding ."
"dharr 's face instantly cleared ."
"the decision was made ."
"victoria would be his bride in six months ."
"he would have to reveal to her that he was king but he would hold off on that for a few more meetings ."
"he was still enjoying the anonymity of being with her ."
"yes , he 'd hold off for a while longer ."
"she would eventually find out the truth and that would be soon enough ."
"so far , he had n't lied to her ."
"if she ever asked a question that he had to reveal the truth , he would so do at that time ."
"he considered putting guards on her but then rejected the idea at least for the moment ."
"he 'd never done that before and doing so would reveal too much ."
"besides , any guard stationed near to her would be pretty obvious ."
"his elite forces were trained to protect ."
"not to blend in ."
"there were other agents that he could assign to the task ."
"they were meant to blend , but they were also trained to observe and analyze ."
"he did n't want his actions to be known just yet ."
"`` what are you thinking about so intently ? ''"
"she asked , surprised that she dared ."
"he looked ferocious , she thought to herself ."
"how could the man go from smiling to a hard , unrevealing face in only moments ?"
"`` you , '' he said without hesitation ."
"`` and how hungry i am , '' he said honestly ."
"but it was n't for food ."
"now that he had made the decision , his body was aching to touch her , and make her his own ."
"to teach her about sex and making love and all the ways to pleasure each other ."
"but he reveled in the pain those thoughts produced ."
"the waiting would only make the culmination more intense , more powerful ."
"his mind controlled his body and he allowed the pain to enter into his mind , blocking out the urges so he could enjoy the game , the chase , and especially the discovery ."
"instead of telling her the rest , he picked up his plate and tasted the chicken ."
"it was actually quite good ."
"the meat was tender and juicy with a subtle taste of garlic and some other herb he could n't identify ."
"`` i 'm touched that you went to this much trouble just for me . ''"
"victoria laughed ."
"`` it was nothing , '' she lied ."
"she had rushed home from her exams and dumped her books before heading out to the grocery store ."
"it was n't a short walk either since most of the students were encouraged to eat in the dining halls ."
"several students cooked their meals but they generally had bikes to get to and from the market ."
"once she 'd picked up all the ingredients , she hurried back to her dorm and spent the afternoon cooking , cutting , baking and mixing the meal , desperate to impress him with her cooking ."
"she loved to cook and it usually relaxed her ."
"but she knew what kinds of foods dharr was used to and had gone to extra effort , and expense , just to show him that she could do something for him ."
"she definitely could n't afford to take him out to eat , unable to afford the prices at a normal restaurant , much less the kind he frequented ."
"but she could cook a decent meal ."
"the evening was supposed to be her opportunity to ask him questions and she was able to get a few in ."
"but the majority of the time , she answered his ."
"for every one question she was able to ask , he asked five ."
"but she did n't mind ."
"it was obvious to her that he was n't used to sharing his past with others so even the small tidbits of information he revealed were precious to her and she savored his laughter and stories in her heart ."
"victoria suspected that he did n't laugh much so she searched her memories of her childhood for stories she thought he might laugh at ."
"growing up in a small village with her parents and sister on a small farm , she 'd had plenty of humorous stories to tell him ."
"the whole time though , she was intensely conscious of his thigh so near to her own ."
"and each time she moved or he moved , it seemed that they were somehow closer together ."
"by the time she pulled the cookies out for dessert , the sun had set and the stars were popping out in the inky night sky and she was searching for something more to say , to distract herself from his body which was only an inch away from hers ."
"why did this one man make her body come alive when no other man had had any effect on her ?"
"she 'd been around many men before , dated whenever she felt like she was missing out on something but then finding that most men were fine as friends but annoying when they tried to kiss her ."
"why could n't she have at least learned something from those other men so she did n't feel so awkward now when all she wanted to do was reach up and kiss him , to touch her lips to his and feel those wonderful sensations that only he could create within her ?"
"dharr watched her smile and talk ."
"he noted each time her eyes dropped to his mouth and saw the flustered look in her face ."
"she 'd stopped caring about his guards and was completely focused on him ."
"he knew she wanted him to kiss her but he held out , enjoying the fact that she was suffering a small amount of what he was feeling ."
"but her being a virgin , she had no idea what he was going through ."
"one had to know the ecstasy of release to understand the power and allure that the sexual act could be ."
"finally , he gave in to her not so subtle messages ."
"`` come here , victoria , '' he said , his voice soft and interrupting her sentence that she was floundering to finish ."
"the food had all been put away and re-stored in the picnic basket ."
"so there was nothing to impede her from moving closer to him ."
"but still , she hesitated ."
"she looked at the small distance between them , then up to his eyes ."
"her mouth opened and her eyes glanced down ."
"`` what did you need ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` i want you to come here , move onto my lap , '' he instructed ."
"he saw the burn start in her clear , green eyes even in the dark ."
"the pulse at the base of her throat sped up and he could tell that she knew exactly what he wanted to do to her ."
"well , not exactly , he corrected ."
"she thought he only wanted to kiss her ."
"and possibly that was all he would do ."
"but it was n't all he wanted to do ."
"`` on your lap ? ''"
"she asked , her voice barely above a whisper ."
"when she did n't move , he pulled her around and settled her on his thighs , careful that she did n't feel the bulge of his manhood ."
"surely that would scare her off , running and screaming ."
"eventually , he would let her feel what she did to him , how he wanted her ."
"but closer to the time when he would propose ."
"otherwise , he did n't know what she would do ."
"he was afraid his desire would scare her away ."
"he 'd have to teach her slowly , carefully ."
"`` yes , right here , like this . ''"
"he rested his hands on her waist ."
"`` put your hands on my shoulders now , '' he said ."
"instantly , victoria did as he said but felt silly ."
"she just wanted to kiss him ."
"finally , he bent his head and touched his lips to hers ."
"at the first touch of their lips , her breath exhaled , her eyes closed and she let her mind revel in the wonderful , exciting feeling of kissing him ."
"`` open your mouth , '' he said softly , still rubbing his lips against hers , caressing her and watching her face to see the reaction he had on her ."
"he loved to see her face respond , to feel the shivers run through her body ."
"victoria 's hands were gripping his shoulders , her mouth imitating his ."
"she loved the fact that she could move her tongue , mating with his and her body arched into his ."
"her breasts felt heavy and her nipples painfully hard as they pressed against his chest ."
"her hands forgot to hold onto his shoulders and crept up to tangle in his hair ."
"with one swift movement , victoria was no longer sitting on his lap but was on her back , his large , muscular body pressing her down while his mouth moved from hers to travel across her jaw , stopping on her ear and victoria whimpered in pleasure , her hands holding his head where it was ."
"but he was stronger than she and her hands were no match for him , his head traveled to nibble on her neck , sending sparks shooting throughout her body ."
"and still he moved lower ."
"dharr 's mouth nuzzled , the strap of her sundress out of the way , his mouth moving across her shoulder , nibbling the sensitive flesh revealed ."
"victoria felt like her body was on fire ."
"every place dharr 's mouth traveled , small sensations of desire sparked through her body ."
"molten lava filled her veins instead of blood and she tried to hold herself still , not wanting to reveal to him what she was feeling inside , but her body was under his power ."
"she cried out when he touched her skin on her shoulder and her breasts were aching to have him touch them , but she was terrified just the same ."
"`` dharr ? ''"
"she gasped , her eyes opening and searching for him ."
"she wanted reassurance but he simply moved away from her breast , returning to her mouth , kissing her until the resistance left her body and she was kissing him back , the moans and gasps returning as his hands touched her arms , her waist , her ears and shoulders ."
"after several minutes , dharr pulled away , looking down into her face ."
"victoria tried to appear casual , like she 'd done this several times and was n't phased by the feelings rampaging through her body ."
"but the reality was she was so excited but still so terrified she could barely think ."
"kissing a man like dharr , the aura of danger and power surrounding him , she was n't sure what to do , what he wanted her to do and knew she would never be able to live up to the other women in his life ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' she said , noting the anger on his face and tried to sit up ."
"but he did n't want that ."
"instead , he leaned down over her again , his chest pressing into hers , pressing her back against the soft earth as she had been only moments before ."
"`` why are you sorry ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"victoria was terrified of him now ."
"he was angry and gritting his teeth ."
"she could feel something about him that she could n't define and was terrified to even try defining ."
"`` i 'm sorry i 'm not ... .you know , '' she finished , not able to hold his gaze ."
"`` you need more than i 'm ... . ''"
"she floundered , unable to say the words that would push him away but knowing she could n't do this to him and be too scared to deliver ."
"what he made her feel was too intense and unfamiliar ."
"`` i 've never done this before , '' she whispered ."
"`` i know . ''"
"he stood up and then reached down to help her to her feet ."
"as soon as she was standing , he pulled her into his arms , looking down into her eyes that were wide with confusion and fear but he noted with satisfaction that her body was still singing with passion and she went willingly into his arms , despite the fact that she was afraid of what he made her feel ."
"`` no , you do n't know ."
"i 've never ... '' she looked down at his shirt , her fingers playing with the buttons there ."
"`` i 've never even ... '' dharr waited patiently but when he understood that she was struggling with her embarrassment , he relented ."
"`` you 've never kissed a man like that ? ''"
"he asked , already knowing the answer ."
"`` yes ... but that was n't what i was going to say , '' she whispered ."
"`` you 've never slept with a man ? ''"
"he suggested , putting his hand underneath her chin , forcing her to look at him ."
"`` i know that already , '' he said ."
"she wanted to sing with relief but then her spirits sank ."
"`` i 'm sorry i 'm so ... pathetic , '' she said , wishing she 'd learned something from her past dates ."
"something that would show him that she was n't so silly and naive ."
"he gripped her shoulders gently but his words were hard as stone ."
"`` never apologize for being pure , victoria ."
"never !"
"it is a great gift you will give to your husband . ''"
"he looked at her as if he wanted to say something more but stopped himself ."
"`` trust me , '' he ordered ."
"`` and never apologize for that again , '' he said ."
"`` trust you ? ''"
"she repeated ."
"with a small laugh , she shook her head ."
"`` i do n't really know you ."
"how can i trust you ? ''"
"he looked at her face which was not angry in any way but smiling up into his frustrated but controlled features ."
"`` you already do , '' he said , his arrogance revealed once again ."
"victoria had to laugh but she still nodded her head ."
"`` yes ."
"i suppose i do , '' she replied ."
"`` come , you need sleep , '' he said , knowing it was almost midnight ."
"`` tell me what your plans are for tomorrow , '' he ordered as he started walking away , pulling her hand through his arms and heading in the direction of the car ."
"she started to walk with him but then pulled back , remembering their picnic ."
"`` oh , the blanket and food ! ''"
"she explained , about to forget everything after the way he 'd made her feel ."
"she pulled her arm out from his but he stopped her , shaking his head ."
"`` do n't worry about those ."
"they will be taken care of , '' he replied and pulled her hand back into his and started walking , ignoring the blanket and basket of food as he moved down to the sidewalk that lined the thames river ."
"`` tell me what you will be doing tomorrow , '' he ordered again ."
"victoria thought about her schedule with only a part of her mind ."
"the other half was looking backwards and , in the darkness , she saw one of his guards walk over to her blanket and fold it , then lift the picnic basket , hurrying towards the limousine ."
"as soon as they were out in the open , the other four guards formed a loose perimeter ."
"if she did n't know better , she would assume that they were just four large , bulky men walking along the riverbank with the other tourists ."
"`` victoria , answer my question , '' he stated sternly , knowing she was concerned about the guards again ."
"he wanted her to learn to ignore them since she would soon be surrounded by them herself once she accepted his proposal ."
"`` oh , '' she said , turning back to him , surprised at the stern tone ."
"she thought quickly about her schedule the next day , `` i have four classes tomorrow ."
"thankfully , exams are over but i have reports to write now for the end of the semester . ''"
"he asked her questions about her classes , her professors , the reports she was planning to write and how her exams went ."
"it sounded slightly like an interview but she did n't mind ."
"she put it down to him just being curious about her life and what she did ."
"in a way , it was flattering ."
"she wondered what he would say if she returned the interrogation ."
"there was a small silence as they walked the last few feet of the sidewalk and she worked hard to gain the courage to ask ."
"`` what are you doing tomorrow ? ''"
"she asked when they 'd reached the car ."
"a guard sprung forward to open it and victoria was proud that she had n't just stepped forward to open it herself ."
"she 'd remembered dharr 's instruction earlier in the evening , thankfully ."
"`` i have meetings all day tomorrow , '' he said simply ."
"`` what kinds of meetings ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he pulled her onto his lap and shook his head , `` boring meetings with men that you do n't know , '' was all he would say before his head dipped to kiss her ."
"victoria wanted to question him more about his meetings , after all , he 'd asked her very specific questions about her day , why should n't she do the same ?"
"but his mouth stopped her questions and she was just as happy to return the kiss , feeling safe now that they were in the back of the limousine and he probably would n't do anything too revealing to her with the driver only a few feet away ."
"dharr walked her to her door that night and kissed her one more time ."
"`` give me your mobile number , '' he said when he lifted his head ."
"slowly , she came back to earth and her mind started working ."
"`` mobile ? ''"
"she asked stupidly ."
"dharr liked the way she became flustered after every kiss ."
"smothering a victorious smile which she might misinterpret he waited a moment more , watching her beautiful green eyes focus before asking again ."
"`` yes , give me the number so i can call you , '' he said ."
"`` um ... i do n't have one , '' she replied , biting her lip nervously ."
"all her friends had a mobile phone but she could n't afford one ."
"she figured that the only people who would call her could do so on the regular lines which were provided by the school ."
"there had never been a need for the extra expense of a mobile ."
"dharr 's eyes looked down into hers , slightly surprised that someone would n't have a mobile phone in this day and age ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"instead of telling him the truth , she simply shrugged her shoulders ."
"`` no need , '' she replied ."
"`` you have a need now , '' he said and stepped back ."
"`` i 'll have one delivered . ''"
"she did n't like the sound of that ."
"`` dharr , really , there 's no need i promise . ''"
"he touched a finger to her lips , silencing her with his touch ."
"`` you walk around campus during the day and night and from what you 've just told me , you study in the library until it closes at midnight , '' he said swiftly ."
"`` not to mention the fact that i want to be able to reach you when i have a free moment ."
"i ca n't contact you easily with the normal phone and i want to make sure you have some sort of security while you walk around campus . ''"
"victoria grimaced inwardly ."
"put that way , it sounded nice ."
"perhaps she could cut back on some things and be able to afford the charges ."
"`` okay , i 'll look into it , '' she said , knowing she 'd spend several hours looking for the cheapest phone and payment plan ."
"`` you 'll do no such thing , '' he said ."
"`` i 'll have one delivered to you . ''"
"`` but i do n't know if i 'll be able to afford ... '' she started to say ."
"`` you will not worry about money , '' he interrupted ."
"`` it will be taken care of . ''"
"victoria did n't like the sound of that ."
"`` but , i 'm not sure that 's such a good idea . ''"
"she considered that if she could n't pay for it , there was n't any need for her to enjoy the luxury ."
"she liked living within her means and presents were meant to be small items like a scarf or gloves , not a cell phone ."
"`` victoria , accept this as something that will put my mind at ease ."
"i do n't like thinking of you walking alone at night ."
"are you free this weekend ? ''"
"he asked , changing the subject as if the discussion was over ."
"victoria wanted to argue with him but she allowed him to change the subject since it was more interesting anyway ."
"`` this weekend ?"
"i think i 'm only studying ."
"i do n't have any plans that i know of at this point . ''"
"`` good ."
"i 'll pick you up friday night for dinner , '' he said ."
"with a small , hard kiss , he turned and left , leaving victoria smiling at the way he ordered her around ."
"he was used to getting his own way but , as she let herself into the suite , she was n't going to ignore her upbringing simply because he told her to ."
"the next two months were the most exciting of victoria 's life ."
"dharr showed her all over london , bringing her to restaurants she 'd never even heard of but were the trendy spots to see all the exciting people of london ."
"there were only two moments to mar her happiness , both times , she gave in to him , afraid of his anger if she did n't ."
"she knew that he would n't hurt her in any way ."
"but she did n't want him to be angry ."
"she wanted to please him ."
"it was a silly need that bubbled up in her each time he made a request of her ."
"the first time was the day following their picnic ."
"she was in her suite studying when the doorbell rang ."
"instantly , she rushed over to it , expecting scott as he was coming to study with her and help her with her art history class which she was struggling in ."
"he 'd convinced her to sign up for the class as her one elective and now she was barely scraping by with a b when she 'd previously received only as in her other classes ."
"but instead of her gangly friend , a bulky , dark and angry looking man stood in her doorway ."
"`` compliments of ashir , '' he said mysteriously , handing her a medium sized box and left ."
"a moment later , victoria was still standing in the doorway when scott walked up ."
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"he asked , pushing past her and dumping his books on her sofa ."
"`` i do n't know , '' she said warily ."
"`` what 's all this ? ''"
"he asked , looking at the open phone book and the notes filled with figures on her notebook ."
"victoria looked up from the box she was trying to open and saw what he was reviewing ."
"`` oh , that , '' she said and dumped the box on the table , walking over to sit next to him on the sofa ."
"`` dharr asked me to get a mobile so i was researching prices ."
"but i really do n't know what i 'm doing , '' she said , putting her hand against her forehead in frustration ."
"`` there are so many types and conveniences , i 'm not sure what i need ."
"i mean , if all he needs is a way to connect with me , then why do n't i just get a very basic phone ? ''"
"scott nodded ."
"`` i agree with you ."
"i ca n't see you text messaging someone , eh ? ''"
"he laughed ."
"`` anyway , i found a really good deal via the mail recently ."
"i 'll bring it over next time and you can compare that rate with the other ones you have here , '' he said , indicating the air time minutes and costs she 'd scribbled all over the paper ."
"`` i think mine is a little better than these rates . ''"
"victoria was relieved ."
"she could understand and read people but when it came to technology , she just got lost in the masses of possibilities ."
"`` great ."
"i ca n't imagine getting hooked on it like you and marcus are , '' she sighed ."
"`` i hate talking on phones in the best of times . ''"
"`` that 's why there are computers , dearie ! ''"
"he laughed , knowing that it was easier to send her an electronic message since she was writing her reports all the time now until the end of the semester ."
"he rarely bothered to call her anymore ."
"`` okay , well that settles , it , '' she said ."
"`` now teach me about this modern art stuff because i just do n't get it , '' she exclaimed , seriously doubting he could reveal the significance of the art to her ."
"they just looked like blobs on a paper , or sometimes streaks ."
"but she did n't understand why they told a story or showed the emotions of the artist ."
"an hour later , they were still going over the pictures as scott pointed out characteristics to her when the box started ringing ."
"both of them looked up at the same time , looking over at the ringing brown box ."
"then , as if in a comedy , they turned to face each other , their mouths open in a round o , both wondering what the phone was going to do ."
"`` do you think it 's a bomb ? ''"
"scott asked , warily ."
"victoria scoffed ."
"`` why in the world would you say something like that ? ''"
"she asked , but the memory of dharr 's guards flashed into her mind ."
"she looked back at the box as it rang again ."
"getting up , she picked up the box and found an edge to the paper ."
"tearing it open , she found a sophisticated mobile phone ringing over and over again ."
"`` how do i turn it on ? ''"
"she asked , understanding that dharr had sent it to her despite her claim that she would handle it herself ."
"`` i do n't know , '' he said , standing up and coming over to her ."
"the phone did n't stop ringing for several minutes ."
"they both breathed a sigh of relief but a moment later , it started up again ."
"finally , scott found the right button and handed it to her ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"she said into the phone ."
"`` victoria ?"
"why did it take you so long to answer ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"victoria 's eyes widened at his angry tone ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i did n't open the box when it arrived so it was difficult to get into initially ."
"then i did n't know how to operate it . ''"
"she saw scott 's reaction to her instantaneous apology and turned away , not liking the concern she saw revealed in his eyes ."
"`` let me get this straight , '' dharr was saying , `` you received a box but did n't open it to find out what was inside ?"
"do you get gifts so often that they are nothing to you ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"she was surprised and a little hurt by his interpretation of the situation ."
"`` no , it was n't like that at all ."
"i was just waiting for someone and got distracted ."
"it 's art history , you know ."
"i told you how difficult it was for me last night ."
"i 'm trying to figure it out ."
"i do n't usually get packages , i promise . ''"
"even victoria felt odd apologizing like this ."
"had she lost her spine ?"
"she 'd done nothing wrong ."
"and why was she hiding the fact that the person who had come over was male ?"
"because she knew dharr would be furious ."
"she did n't have any proof , but she sensed that deep down , he was a very possessive male and knowing that he was from ashir , she suspected he was very jealous and old fashioned ."
"studying with a man , even a gay man , would be forbidden ."
"`` good , '' he snapped , apparently satisfied by her response ."
"`` how are you ? ''"
"victoria shook her head ."
"all the anger was gone from his voice ."
"`` i 'm fine ."
"how are your meetings ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` fine ."
"i wanted to make sure you liked your new phone ."
"is it okay ?"
"did they program it appropriately ? '"
"victoria walked into her small , galley style kitchen and bit her lip ."
"`` dharr , i thought i mentioned that i would get my own phone , '' she said , looking out the window but not really seeing anything as she concentrated on making dharr understand her position on the mobile phone ."
"`` you 'll have to accept this from me , '' he countered ."
"`` i want to know you are safe ."
"this phone has an emergency alarm on it if you get into trouble , '' he explained ."
"`` and it has my phone number already programmed in ."
"feel free to call me whenever you like , '' he said softly ."
"`` i have to go now ."
"i 'll see you friday night , '' he said and rung off ."
"victoria pressed the button to turn it off and turned back to find scott sitting on the sofa again , looking at her with interest ."
"`` i 'm guessing that 's your new love ? ''"
"he asked , one eyebrow raised in question ."
"`` yes ."
"that was dharr , '' she replied ."
"`` and should i also assume you 've no need for the calling plan i mentioned earlier ? ''"
"victoria hesitated ."
"a part of her wanted to assert herself to dharr ."
"but another part of her knew that she only had a small amount of time with him and did n't want to spend it arguing about something so nonsensical as a phone ."
"`` i guess not , '' she finally replied ."
"scott looked at her for another long moment ."
"finally , he leaned forward and pulled the art history book closer ."
"`` here 's one your professor will probably have on the exam , '' he said ."
"victoria considered explaining herself to scott but she did n't ."
"she was eager to move on and pretend that the scene had n't taken place ."
"the second incident occurred about two weeks later ."
"she was on her way to the bookstore where she worked about ten hours a week ."
"the work gave her just enough spending money to buy what she needed in the way of books and supplies , plus a few minor extras if she was careful ."
"she was n't being very careful lately , she thought as she entered the bookstore through the back where the employees entered ."
"she was spending more on her clothes and makeup just so she could spruce herself up for dharr when he phoned ."
"smiling at her manager , she was putting her coat away when her mobile rang ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"she answered , knowing it was dharr ."
"he was the only one who had the mobile 's number ."
"jasmine had been thrilled to know she finally had broken down and gotten a mobile phone and had asked for the number so she could reach her for parties and such ."
"but victoria had refused to give it out ."
"she was n't paying the air time on the phone so she did n't want to waste dharr 's money on calls other than to him , regardless of how wealthy he was ."
"scott did n't even ask for the number and she felt his censure each time dharr called and scott was around ."
"`` hello beautiful ."
"i 'm in town unexpectedly ."
"come have brunch with me . ''"
"victoria was instantly disappointed ."
"`` i 'm just about to start work ."
"i ca n't really meet you today ."
"how long are you going to be in town ? ''"
"`` what do you mean , 'work ' ? ''"
"he asked , saying the word as if were dirty ."
"victoria hesitated , shocked by the instant anger in his voice ."
"she turned away from her co-workers who were joking about their classes while getting their bookstore aprons on ."
"`` dharr , i 'm sure i mentioned that i work in the bookstore a few mornings each week . ''"
"`` no , i 'm equally certain that you did n't mention that ."
"you 'll have to quit that job , victoria . ''"
"she was stunned ."
"his tone brooked no room for argument ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"she asked , sure she 'd misunderstood ."
"`` you ca n't work , victoria ."
"i wo n't have it . ''"
"she pulled the phone away from her ear and stared at it as if it had grown a head ."
"putting it back to her ear , she said , `` did you just tell me that i had to quit ? ''"
"`` that 's exactly what i said ."
"give me the address and i 'll swing by ."
"you do n't need to work ."
"if you need money , i 'll give you an allowance . ''"
"victoria gasped ."
"`` an allowance ? ''"
"she spit out ."
"`` i 'm not a child who needs an allowance ."
"i work just enough hours to buy what i need and i 'm not quitting no matter how angry you get , '' she snapped ."
"she wanted to hang up on him , she was so furious ."
"the only thing that stopped her was that it would be extremely rude and her mother would be horrified at the breach in manners ."
"`` do n't challenge me victoria , '' he said ."
"his voice was n't angry but was deadly calm ."
"`` meet me for brunch ."
"i do n't have much time , '' he demanded again ."
"she was actually shaking with her anger ."
"no one ordered her around , no matter how handsome and charming he could be during all the other times ."
"`` no ."
"excuse me but i have to go now ."
"my shift is starting ."
"i 'll call you when i 'm done ."
"goodbye dharr . ''"
"without another word , victoria snapped the phone shut and shoved it into her pocket ."
"it started ringing a moment later but she simply turned off the ringer and shut it away in her locker ."
"stomping furiously out of the storeroom , she took the first box of books she saw and started shelving them ."
"how dare he speak to her like that ?"
"she fumed as she took the books out of the box and placed them on the shelf ."
"the others joked with her that she was doing the work of three people that day ."
"even her manager laughed , nodding to indicate that the statement was true ."
"all of them tried to find out why she was so angry but she simply helped the next customer in line or started stacking books again , whichever was closest at the time ."
"she still had n't calmed down by the time she finished her shift six hours later ."
"she grabbed her phone and started the long walk back to her dorm ."
"she was so angry , she did n't see the big , burley man following her , or notice when he made a phone call ."
"unlocking her door , she was just about to toss her bag onto the floor and storm into her room when a dark shadow moved out of the corner of her eye ."
"gasping , victoria 's anger disappeared , replaced by a desperate fear for her safety ."
"someone was in her apartment , she thought ."
"frantically searching for the phone to call the police , her hand had just reached it when something in her head stopped her ."
"a moment later , dharr stood up and moved forward , his anger a physical force within the small common room ."
"she placed the phone back into the cradle and turned to him , trying to be angry but too relieved that it was just him and not a burglar ."
"`` how did you get in here ? ''"
"she asked , backing up a step as he moved closer to her ."
"`` do n't worry about that , '' he said ."
"`` you hung up on me , '' he stated ."
"`` and you disobeyed me . ''"
"she was going to stand her ground , she told herself ."
"he would n't hurt her , she knew that so there was no need to be afraid of him ."
"lifting her chin , she stopped backing up and looked up into his angry , black eyes ."
"`` yes ."
"i did ."
"you 're not my father ."
"i do n't follow your orders , '' she said ."
"she 'd backed down before but on this , she was making a stand ."
"it was too important ."
"`` not yet , '' he said and took a lock of her hair between his fingers ."
"`` but soon , '' he stated , wrapping more of her hair around his hand , then pulling her head back ."
"`` you may not work , victoria ."
"i wo n't allow it , '' he said a moment before his mouth descended to hers ."
"this kiss was not soft but it still captured her , throwing her into a state of desire so instantaneous it took her breath away ."
"her hands reached up to his shoulders and her body moved against his ."
"`` you also made me wait , '' he ground out , and a moment later his hands captured her waist , lifting her up so she was eye level with him ."
"he pushed her back against the door , then pushed his body against hers , holding her there in that way , allowing his hands to move over her body ."
"`` do n't ever do that again , '' he grated out ."
"`` dharr ! ''"
"she cried out when his teeth captured her ear , biting hard but the sensation was n't scary ."
"she wrapped her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck , pulling him closer , mindless to the desire pooling within her body , ending near her core and moistening her underwear ."
"she was embarrassed that he had such power over her but there was nothing she could do to resist him ."
"each time he touched her , he controlled her completely ."
"he was always the one to end their kisses , leaving her almost begging for him to continue ."
"the only thing stopping her was the fear of the unknown , of his touch and the fear of what he might want from her ."
"she was terrified that she could n't deliver ."
"he was so dynamic and experienced , how in the world could she ever compare to the other women he 'd been with ?"
"and the feelings were too new , too raw and too overwhelming ."
"that day , he 'd ended the kiss with a growl and left her , standing in the middle of her sitting room looking confused ."
"the only words he said were , `` i 'll call you when i 'm back in town . ''"
"a moment later , he was gone , leaving her shaking with unsatisfied desire and deep frustration over his autocratic manner ."
"in the end , she did n't need to quit her job , nor did she make any moves to do so , despite his order that she stop working ."
"she suspected that dharr took care of that himself ."
"her manager just slowly started cutting back on her hours ."
"so two weeks later , she had no income ."
"when he came to pick her up that night , she questioned him about it ."
"but he only changed the subject ."
"not having any proof , she could n't accuse him of anything ."
"the rest of the time spent with him was wonderful ."
"dharr took her to exciting places to eat or dance ."
"she went to almost every theatre for the wonderful productions and was thrilled at the end of each night when he took her into his arms ."
"he always kissed her until she was senseless , begging for something she did n't understand ."
"but he never took it too far ."
"no matter how much she writhed in his arms , mindless with desire and almost crying out with the need for whatever was at the end , he never tried to touch her breast again ."
"finals were coming up and victoria was spending as much time as possible in the library studying ."
"the library was open all night on some nights , allowing students to finish their research and study during the final week ."
"victoria knew she 'd see dharr on saturday night and since she had no job , she allowed herself to sleep in , exhausted from being in the library until almost two in the morning ."
"dharr 's meetings had ended earlier than anticipated and his first thought was to find victoria and spend the afternoon with her ."
"it was almost time to reveal her future to her and , on the flight to london that morning , he considered his plans ."
"at the idea of seeing victoria again , his body responded , painfully ready for her ."
"as always , he allowed the pain to filter into his mind , numbing his body since the wanting was so intense ."
"he 'd followed his plan exactly and now he knew that victoria was in the same state of almost constant arousal he was in ."
"just touching her now and her body responded without hesitation to his touch , his kiss ."
"the first time he 'd ventured towards her breast , she 'd been afraid ."
"now , he knew that when he touched her again , she would n't be afraid ."
"the desire within her was a fever , needing to be assuaged ."
"the fear would be gone and only the desire would be there ."
"it took less time than he 'd imagined originally ."
"he 'd given himself two months , but after only six weeks , he knew he would have to move up the wedding date ."
"there was no way he could wait another four months to have her ."
"and he knew that she felt the same way ."
"each simple touch and she was mindless ."
"he smiled grimly , knowing that moving the wedding date up would also help him ."
"he found himself thinking about her too often ."
"he attributed his lack of attention to the need for release ."
"he had n't been with another woman since meeting her and now he too needed something ."
"but it could only be assuaged by victoria ."
"he would announce his engagement next week after revealing all to victoria tonight ."
"his plane landed and his driver made their way through the early morning london traffic ."
"it was towards the end of rush hour but still thick with londoners getting to and from their work place ."
"he did n't call victoria this time , wanting to surprise her ."
"now that he 'd gotten her out of that awful , menial job , he knew she 'd be where she should be ."
"in bed ."
"waiting for him ."
"the idea made his groin throb and he shifted uncomfortably before he could regain control ."
"he hurried up the steps to her apartment , wondering what she would be like right out of bed ."
"he knew she 'd be warm and sleepy , her long , sexy hair tumbled around her shoulders ."
"no makeup ."
"he liked that idea ."
"he wanted to see what she was like , pure and fresh ."
"there were many ways he wanted to see her and that was just one way ."
"writhing naked underneath him , begging for the release he would give her , on top of him , taking her time with him , the positions went on and on and he had to switch gears or the erection he seemed to continuously have now whenever he came near her , or even thought about her , would be embarrassingly obvious ."
"he also wanted to see her swell with his child , holding their son close to suckle at her breast ."
"ah , he thought ."
"he 'd chosen well ."
"victoria 's beauty would go well with his strength ."
"she would help him produce the next heir to the throne ."
"he chuckled as he skipped up the last step ."
"he supposed he should tell her that she would be queen ."
"she 'd like that , he thought to himself ."
"no more studying ... ."
"dharr 's thoughts were halted abruptly when the door to victoria 's suite opened just as he 'd lifted his hand to knock ."
"`` oh !"
"hello ! ''"
"a tall , gangly man was saying ."
"dharr took in the man who was tall , but still a few inches shorter than he was ."
"he had obviously just rolled out of bed since his hair was messed up ."
"he was only wearing a pair of drawstring sweatpants and a torn tee shirt ."
"in his hands was a huge sandwich and a large grin on his face ."
"`` you must be victoria 's man , eh ? ''"
"the man asked ."
"`` dharr hokum qudama , '' dharr replied , ignoring the outstretched hand the younger man offered ."
"`` i 'm here to see victoria ."
"is she in ? ''"
"he asked ."
"without waiting , dharr pushed past the man into the suite ."
"`` oh , hey , '' scott said , about to argue with the man who obviously needed a lesson in manners ."
"but he remembered that victoria was over the moon for the man so he held his tongue ."
"he had to have some redeeming qualities if she loved him like she did ."
"`` i say , she 's still sleeping , '' he replied when dharr looked around the room ."
"dharr 's black eyes snapped back to the bedraggled man ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"scott could n't help it , he was getting irritated by the man 's domineering attitude ."
"`` i mean , she was up late last night and she 's still sleeping . ''"
"he tried to keep a civil tone but he remembered the one sided conversation about the phone several weeks ago and did n't like the man ."
"`` how about if you come back later ? ''"
"dharr 's mind was spinning out of control ."
"what was this man doing in victoria 's suite and how did he know that she was still sleeping ?"
"dharr looked at the sofa but there was no sleeping accoutrements on it to let him know that the man had slept on the sofa ."
"the only other possibility was that he 'd been sleeping in victoria 's bed ."
"the idea blasted through his mind , almost making him lose concentration ."
"`` get out , '' dharr said ."
"thankfully , the man understood dharr 's anger and left , closing the door behind him ."
"dharr walked to the door he knew was victoria 's bedroom and pushed it open ."
"the sight he confronted blew away all doubt he had in his mind about what victoria had been doing last night ."
"he could see only skimpy cotton underwear and nothing else ."
"the blanket was on the floor , obviously forgotten and only a thin sheet covered her nearly naked body ."
"her legs were sprawled out , and her hands were flat against the mattress ."
"it was the most sensuous sight he 'd ever beheld ."
"how could she have given herself to that man ?"
"what on earth would possess her to do such a thing he thought to himself ."
"but then the blame came back to him ."
"he 'd fired her passion one too many times , he thought ."
"and she 'd had to find release somewhere ."
"he 'd been so firm in stopping before things got out of hand over the past six weeks and now she 'd sullied herself by giving her virginity to another man ."
"the pain that ripped through dharr was beyond anything he 'd ever felt before ."
"and as he looked down at the sleeping beauty , he wanted to inflict the same pain on her that he was now feeling ."
"he 'd never hated anyone before , his power being so absolute that he could crush an enemy with little effort ."
"and now he would crush victoria ."
"he would crush her just as she was now crushing him ."
"he 'd make her pay ."
"with seething fury , dharr closed the door and walked over to the bed ."
"he did n't even bother to take off his jacket or tie ."
"he just sat down on the bed , letting his weight roll her towards him ."
"the tiny scrap of material covering her breasts just made him angrier ."
"it was only a small , cotton camisole and he could see her nipples through the thin fabric ."
"`` victoria , '' he said softly but enough to wake her up slightly ."
"her head rolled over and her hand pushed her mass of thick hair out of her eyes ."
"blinking , she looked up sleepily at him ."
"`` dharr ? ''"
"she asked ."
"to dharr 's anger infused mind , her question only confirmed her guilt further ."
"to him , she was confirming her current lover 's name before proceeding and it added fuel to the fire of his increasing fury ."
"`` why do you have to ask ? ''"
"he said ."
"his hand dove into her hair and pulled her face up to his for a kiss ."
"`` are you so confused ? ''"
"victoria 's eyes lost their sleep and became confused but a moment after his lips touched hers , her hands reached out and held onto his shoulders ."
"she pulled her body up , wanting to be as close as possible to him , needing to feel him against her ."
"her soft moans only made him furious but he would n't relent ."
"not yet ."
"his hand came down to touch her breast , the thumb rubbing it to a hard nubbin through the cotton fabric ."
"he captured her cry in his mouth while his other hand slipped underneath the fabric , doing the same to the other nipple ."
"he heard her cries of passion but was merciless ."
"he pulled the fabric up and pushed her down on to the mattress , his mouth taking over where his thumb had been and victoria almost screamed out with the pleasure that was pulsing through her system ."
"`` dharr !"
"please ."
"you have to stop , '' she said but her hands were pulling at his hair , keeping his mouth in place instead of pulling away , contradicting her plea to stop ."
"`` not yet , victoria ."
"soon though . ''"
"`` no ! ''"
"she cried out , her legs spreading immediately when his hand reached down ."
"he pushed her underwear out of the way , his finger sliding against her clitoris and victoria inhaled sharply , painfully ."
"when his finger moved inside her and his thumb continued on in it 's place , she could feel herself floating higher and higher ."
"his mouth still covered her breast , suckling hard , nipping then soothing only to repeat the process while his finger and thumb created their own kind of magic ."
"without warning , victoria slipped over the cliff into an orgasm that was so intense , she almost blacked out , her fingers clenching and unclenching in dharr 's hair ."
"dharr had n't meant to give her a release ."
"he 'd meant to raise the pressure , to increase her frustration to the same level that he was feeling ."
"but her body was so responsive , so incredibly wound tight , that with almost no stimulation , she was shivering out her orgasm ."
"the beauty of her climax was so perfect that he helped her through the final moments instead of pulling away as he 'd planned to do ."
"and right now , watching her eyes flutter open again , seeing the flush of satisfaction on her cheeks and feeling the liquid heat surrounding his finger , he wanted to rip off his clothes and sink into her , to find his own release ."
"but her next words stopped him , flooring him yet again and straining his ability to control his anger to the breaking point ."
"`` dharr , '' she sighed ."
"`` why did you do it ? ''"
"he demanded harshly , pulling free of her and standing up ."
"victoria realized that he was completely dressed , not even his tie askew ."
"a moment earlier she 'd felt as if every bone in her body was relaxed and finally sated after weeks of frustration at his hands ."
"the bliss had been worth the wait , she told herself ."
"but the fury she saw in his eyes made her self conscious ."
"she pulled her camisole down and yanked the sheet over her legs , feeling dirty for some reason ."
"`` i do n't understand . ''"
"`` why did you sully yourself ? ''"
"he rasped out ."
"`` you could have had it all ."
"and yet you decided you could n't wait . ''"
"`` sully myself ? ''"
"she repeated ."
"`` you think that what i did sullied me ? ''"
"she asked , the hurt coming through as she watched him look in the mirror and pat his hair back into place ."
"`` how many times ? ''"
"he demanded angrily ."
"`` how many times ? ''"
"she repeated ."
"`` stop repeating my questions , '' he snapped ."
"`` how many have there been ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"victoria tried to sit up straighter in bed but her body just would n't cooperate ."
"`` dharr , could we start this conversation over again ?"
"i 'm not following what you 're asking me . ''"
"dharr turned and looked at her fully , noting the pink tinge to her cheeks and the red lips , swollen from his kisses ."
"he 'd imagined her like this so many times ."
"but in all those fantasies , he was with her , both of them sated and feeling complete ."
"he told himself he only felt betrayed that she had given her virginity to another ."
"but looking at her now , remembering how instantly her body had convulsed around his finger , he wondered if she was more experienced than he 'd assumed ."
"she was obviously well tutored ."
"so for the past six weeks she had been just acting on her part ."
"that infuriated him ."
"he needed to leave before he did or said something he 'd regret ."
"`` goodbye , victoria ."
"unfortunately , you are no longer worthy . ''"
"he said and left the room ."
"he did n't bother to close the door as he left and he did n't look back ."
"the painful memories came flooding back to victoria , forcing her feet to stop walking as she watched the tall , incredibly handsome man step out of the long , black car ."
"the guards were already positioned around him , forming the perimeter she 'd eventually learned to ignore ."
"the months after his departure from her life had been tortuous for her ."
"if it had n't been for jasmine and scott , pushing , teasing , nagging and generally just not allowing her to give into the depression , she would have failed out of school and not even cared ."
"the morning he 'd said those horrible words , victoria had broken down in tears that had n't stopped for two days straight ."
"neither jasmine nor scott could figure out what had been said so they did what they could to comfort her ."
"jasmine had gone to all of her professors and asked for an extension to her exams , explaining that some sort of tragedy had occurred although they could n't figure out what it was through the crying ."
"a week after he left , she took her finals , then wept for another week ."
"she passed , but just barely that semester , her mid terms and the strength of her research papers carrying her through with bs when she would normally have received as straight across ."
"the real slap in the face came when scott arrived on their doorstep one morning with a newspaper ."
"victoria had been showering and came out to see scott and jasmine looking at an article ."
"she walked over , looked down and saw dharr staring out of one of the pictures ."
"the caption revealed so much about him , she was stunned she had n't realized the truth before ."
"the king of ashir finalizes oil leases for great britain the article stated ."
"it was all about how the negotiations had started to flounder about a month ago and all looked lost ."
"but some tricky negotiations had saved the day ."
"victoria had closed herself in her room for the rest of the day , not coming out to eat or talk ."
"eventually , she started living again ."
"she , scott and jasmine graduated , victoria with honors despite her awful semester involving dharr ."
"jasmine was now living with her current boyfriend but victoria had agreed to move in with scott ."
"he and marcus had split up by mutual agreement at that point ."
"now , five years later , scott was starting to make headway into the fashion industry ."
"one of the designs victoria had posed in had caught the eye of a magazine editor and there was the possibility of a layout for the following spring ."
"victoria was a guidance counselor for an elementary school and loved it although she 'd never taken either scott or jasmine up on the offer of another blind date ."
"they teased her unmercifully about her nun-like existence but she preferred to be alone rather than deal with the kind of pain love could inflict on a person ."
"she 'd loved dharr with all her heart and soul , had shivered through her first orgasm with him and then was callously rejected , told she 'd sullied herself and been informed she was no longer worthy ."
"he did n't come forward , but stared at her through dark glasses , waiting for her to come to him ."
"for a long moment , she considered her options ."
"she could just stand here and stare at him ."
"or she could turn around the way she 'd come ."
"she could go home and call in sick , which would n't be a lie for she instantly felt sick with anger , both at herself and at him ."
"the other option , which seemed to be the most reasonable , was to walk straight through the front door of the school and ignore him ."
"she did n't feel very reasonable but she remembered that she had several appointments this morning ."
"the kids needed her ."
"their parents needed her ."
"it was only a few days until summer vacation and she needed to help some kids so they would make it through the summer ."
"besides , she refused to let dharr control another second of her life ."
"forcing one foot in front of the other , she eventually made her way to the front door of the building ."
"she was just two feet away when a hand whipped her around ."
"dharr 's face was just as handsome and hard as stone as she remembered it being ."
"`` how are you , victoria ? ''"
"he said ."
"she considered ignoring him , but at that moment , a noisy group of kids ran from the playground , heading into the school ."
"several of them stopped and gave her a hug ."
"`` good morning , ms ."
"mason ! ''"
"they called out , then rushed through the doors , all excited about the upcoming summer vacation ."
"because she was surrounded by impressionable children , she had to set the right example ."
"`` good morning , your highness . ''"
"that was all she would give him ."
"protocol probably required that she curtsy or bow or something along those lines , but she refused , not considering him worthy of the effort to even hold the door for him ."
"she turned to walk into the school , furious when he fell into step beside her ."
"`` you look good , '' he said as they walked through the school 's hallways ."
"`` thank you , '' victoria replied , holding the door wide so five running boys could precede her ."
"`` slow down , mike , '' she called out ."
"then walked through the door herself and pretended he was n't there as she walked to the office to sign in for the day ."
"she picked up her messages at the front desk and sifted through them , painfully aware of dharr standing next to her ."
"`` who 's the hunk ? ''"
"betty asked , eyeing dharr with a wink ."
"victoria did n't smile but she knew she would have to introduce him ."
"doing anything else would only stir up the gossip mills even more ."
"`` betty , this is dharr qudama , '' she introduced , omitting his title ."
"`` dharr , betty , the school secretary and resident flirt . ''"
"victoria smiled at betty since it was an ongoing joke that betty , who was seventy if she was a day , flirted with anyone with testosterone running through their system ."
"`` how do you do ? ''"
"dharr said , and formally bowed , kissing betty 's hand reverently ."
"`` it is a pleasure to meet you . ''"
"betty actually blushed and batted her eyes at dharr 's compliment and charm ."
"victoria controlled her eyes from rolling , but just barely ."
"she wished she could scream and stomp her feet but that would n't be a very good example ."
"`` are you victoria 's boyfriend ? ''"
"one of the other office workers called out ."
"`` bout time , tory ! ''"
"another said ."
"`` good one ! ''"
"yet another called ."
"`` no ."
"he 's just an old ... '' victoria hesitated , wondering how she could describe someone like dharr ... `` just someone i knew when i was in college , '' she finally finished ."
"victoria turned to face dharr ."
"`` perhaps you should come into my office and explain exactly what you want and then get out of here , '' she whispered harshly , hoping none of her co-workers overheard ."
"`` perhaps that would be best , '' he said ."
"victoria led the way to the hallway and unlocked her office door ."
"the room was filled with books and stacks of papers everywhere ."
"there were stuffed animals and a beaten up old sofa that had definitely seen better days ."
"`` have a seat , '' she said , waving to the battered sofa , knowing he would n't dare sit down in it ."
"she watched in amusement as he perched on the edge ."
"`` so what 's up ? ''"
"she asked , sitting down behind her desk and crossing her arms over her chest ."
"`` why the sudden appearance after five years , your highness ? ''"
"there was suddenly a knock on the door and a small face appeared ."
"as soon as the girl saw victoria , she rushed into the room ."
"`` oh , ms ."
"mason ! ''"
"she cried and threw herself into victoria 's arms ."
"victoria held the little girl closely , rocking her back and forth ."
"it was mary gregory and her father had died in a car accident a week ago ."
"her mother was struggling with the four older children and mary seemed to be getting the raw end of the stick emotionally ."
"they just sat there for what seemed like several minutes , then mary stood back ."
"`` thank you , '' she said ."
"`` what happened , mary ? ''"
"victoria asked , forgetting about dharr 's presence for the moment ."
"`` i 'm just silly , '' she sniffed ."
"`` today is my father 's bowling night and ... . ''"
"she broke down in tears but struggled valiantly ."
"eventually , victoria just held her again , letting the little girl cry out her grief ."
"after another five minutes , mary sniffed and took a tissue out of her pocket ."
"`` thank you , ms. mason ."
"i 'll be fine now , '' she said and dried her eyes ."
"`` come on back if you need to , '' victoria said , getting down on her knees so she was more at mary 's level ."
"`` just do n't keep it inside , okay ? ''"
"mary nodded and left , all without seeing or even sensing dharr standing in the corner of the office looking on ."
"`` what happened to her ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria snapped out of it and turned to face dharr , the tears still in her eyes ."
"`` her father died recently ."
"she 's having a hard time of it . ''"
"victoria was n't angry anymore now that mary had come in to diffuse the situation ."
"she 'd reminded victoria of what was important ."
"dharr was n't on that list ."
"not anymore ."
"there was a time she would have turned her life upside down to please him ."
"she had in fact ."
"but not anymore ."
"`` what do you want , your highness , '' she asked again , taking up right where they 'd been interrupted ."
"`` how did you find out ? ''"
"he asked ."
"her eyes widened ."
"`` that you 're the bloody king of ashir and not some lowly oil lease negotiator ? ''"
"she demanded , getting angry about his deception even after five years ."
"dharr ignored the 'bloody ' and nodded his head ."
"`` yes , that would be the question . ''"
"`` what 's the difference ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` why do n't you just tell me what you want and then leave ? ''"
"`` i need your help , '' he stated ."
"victoria wanted to laugh but looking at him , she knew that would n't be a good idea ."
"`` no . ''"
"`` you do n't even know what i need , '' he said firmly ."
"`` should n't you wait to find out before you turn me down ? ''"
"`` no ."
"if i remember correctly , you did n't need me five years ago , so why should you need me now ? ''"
"dharr lifted a large envelope and pulled out two pictures ."
"`` okay , if you wo n't help me , will you help them ? ''"
"he asked , tossing the pictures down onto the desk in front of her ."
"victoria picked up the first one , noting the bright , sunny face and the twinkle in the little girl 's face ."
"she looked mischievous , victoria thought ."
"she flipped the page and a boy looked out at her from the paper ."
"he was too serious , she thought ."
"it was as if the weight of the world were on his tiny shoulders already ."
"`` they 're cute , '' she said , pushing the pictures back at him ."
"`` they 're in trouble , '' he replied ."
"that got her attention ."
"`` why ?"
"the boy maybe but the girl seems happy . ''"
"`` those pictures were taken six months ago ."
"their parents died a week after those pictures were taken ."
"since then , they 've become more and more withdrawn ."
"i 'm worried about them . ''"
"`` who is their closest relative ?"
"they should take care of them . ''"
"`` i 'm their uncle . ''"
"he stepped around the desk , skirting a precarious pile of papers ."
"`` why do n't you hire someone to file ? ''"
"he asked absently ?"
"`` they are n't real papers ."
"the untidiness makes the children feel more comfortable ."
"i think they are all old test papers from about a decade ago . ''"
"dharr nodded his head ."
"`` that only confirms my instincts that i need you . ''"
"`` go hire an expert . ''"
"`` i intend to ."
"when can you start ? ''"
"`` i 'm not an expert in grief counseling . ''"
"`` you understand children ."
"and mary just revealed that you are an expert in grief counseling ."
"she seems like she 's adjusting quite well . ''"
"he looked at his watch and stood up ."
"`` i have to leave for germany in an hour ."
"i can be back here to pick you up in three days ."
"will that be enough time ?"
"the children will be out of school by then so there should n't be any problem . ''"
"victoria stuttered out her outrage ."
"`` no problems ? ''"
"she countered ."
"`` how about my life ?"
"how about my plans for the future ?"
"as of this morning , you and your problems did n't factor into them at all . ''"
"`` of course there will be compensation , '' he said and bent over her desk ."
"he wrote down a number on a piece of paper ."
"`` if the children are n't any enticement , '' he said , `` this should do the trick , '' he said ."
"`` there are other pictures in the envelope ."
"i 'll be in touch , '' he said and left the tiny office without another word ."
"victoria looked down at her notebook and gasped ."
"the figure was three times her annual salary ."
"`` good grief ! ''"
"she thought ."
"pushing that thought aside , she shook her head ."
"`` no way , '' she said out loud ."
"pushing the envelope to the side , she picked up her pencil and realized that her hands were shaking ."
"dammit !"
"how could the man affect her like this after so many years ?"
"she 'd finally convinced herself that she was over him and then he just walks into her life , making things crazy again ."
"well , she would n't let him ."
"five years ago , she 'd jumped at his bidding ."
"any time he called , she 'd relished the idea of spending any amount of time with him she could ."
"but not anymore ."
"he could n't do that to her again ."
"she told herself she was immune to his arrogance and charm ."
"she had the control ."
"he did n't ."
"chapter 5 `` what 's this ? ''"
"scott asked , opening the envelope that had been sitting on her desk at home ."
"they shared a tiny flat in central london ."
"it was n't the best part of town , but it was convenient to both their jobs which suited both of them just fine ."
"she was standing on a pedestal while scott pinned fabric around her body ."
"he was working on a design for a new dress for the magazine layout and she was acting as his model ."
"at the moment , her hair was piled on top of her head to keep it out of his way while he nipped and tucked , putting the finishing touches on a sexy , sultry dress of soft green chiffon that fitted her body so closely , she could n't wear anything underneath ."
"`` thank goodness you 're boobs are still perky enough to pull this off , '' scott said , getting her attention finally ."
"she 'd been holding a file on one of her kids and had n't heard his original question ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"she said , smacking his head playfully ."
"`` i 'm not that old ! ''"
"scott ducked just in time to avoid the file coming down on his head ."
"he grinned unrepentantly before saying , `` i mean , you 're such an old maid , one day , you 're going to be forced to wear a bra when you choose something like this ."
"i 'm just grateful that you 're not there yet , '' he teased ."
"victoria looked down at her breasts and shook her head ."
"`` they are fine , '' she said ."
"`` and i 'm not aging that fast so just knock it off . ''"
"`` at least in this dress , they get a little showing off , eh ? ''"
"he continued ."
"`` since no one else has been seeing them lately . ''"
"victoria rolled her eyes at the old argument , refusing to rise to the baiting ."
"`` scott , just because i 'm not dating , does n't give you the right to criticize my love life ."
"i do n't remember seeing anyone in your bedroom lately . ''"
"scott took a pin out of his mouth and nipped ."
"`` ah , but the operational word here is lately , '' he said ."
"`` i 've had relationships recently ."
"what can we say about you , madam nun ? ''"
"`` no need , '' she replied , hiding the pain of her morning encounter from scott by lifting her file folder up again ."
"`` i have a full enough life as it is ."
"there 's no need to add a man into it and complicate everything , '' she said ."
"she almost said , `` again '' but stopped herself just in time ."
"after dharr , she had n't wanted to meet any new men ."
"for a long time , she had n't been able to dredge up any interest and then it took courage just to look at another man and consider his attractiveness ."
"because each time she looked , she would compare him to dharr and find the man lacking ."
"it had taken over a year just to look at a man and not cringe in disgust ."
"finally , she 'd decided she needed to get over him ."
"unfortunately , she had n't found anyone to compare to him ."
"no matter how much she tried , unconsciously , she still compared the men she met to dharr ."
"so here she was , five years later and still a virgin ."
"much to jasmine and scott 's frustrations ."
"and definitely not from their lack of trying ."
"at every opportunity , they introduced her to one of their new acquaintances , hoping she would take to one of them ."
"but not a single man she 'd met could hold a candle to dharr ."
"besides , she told herself , why deal with the pain ?"
"it had been too hard getting over him last time ."
"why would any woman put herself through that again ?"
"jasmine jumped from man to man but victoria knew that she was n't the kind who could do that ."
"she was the emotionally committed kind , unfortunately , she grimaced ."
"thankfully , scott filled his mouth up with pins again and did n't have the ability to speak for several more minutes ."
"when he was done , he shooed her off to take the dress off ."
"but moments later , just as victoria was pulling on her underwear , scott opened her door , sitting on her bed while she finished putting on a bra and clothes ."
"`` you never told me who these kids were , '' he said ."
"he pulled the pictures out of the envelope and shook his head ."
"`` poor little sprite , '' he said ."
"`` what happened to her ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria was used to talking about her kids at the school but the envelope just hurt her too much ."
"`` just some kids , '' she said ."
"the image of the little boy had haunted her all day ."
"he looked too serious , she thought again ."
"`` the boy looks to be about five or six , right ? ''"
"scott asked ."
"`` something like that , '' she said ."
"victoria had n't taken the time to get the children 's ages from dharr but she supposed that scott 's guess was accurate ."
"he took out another picture and read the caption underneath ."
"`` but the girl is much younger ."
"about three ? ''"
"`` i suppose , '' she replied , zipping the zipper on her jeans shorts ."
"scott looked up at her as she pulled a shirt on over her head , not bothering with a bra because it was too hot ."
"his eyes narrowed as he looked at her , unused to seeing her this emotionally detached when it came to children ."
"`` okay , what 's the deal ?"
"you 're never like this about your kids ."
"spill it , '' he said ."
"scott was sitting at the top of her bed , leaning against the pillows that were stacked up against the headboard ."
"`` they are the niece and nephew to dharr , '' she finally said , her back to scott so he could n't see her face ."
"`` you 're kidding , '' scott replied , sitting up and moving to the end of the bed ."
"`` how did you get these pictures ? ''"
"he asked suspiciously , immediately knowing she was n't giving him the whole story because of the cagey look in her eyes ."
"and the fact that she would n't look directly at him ."
"sighing , victoria decided that she might as well spill the beans ."
"scott would eventually get her to tell it all and would n't stop pestering her until she did ."
"`` dharr was at the school this morning , '' she admitted reluctantly ."
"scott whistled out his surprise ."
"`` what happened to them ? ''"
"scott asked ."
"victoria took a deep breath , grateful that he was focusing on the children and not her reaction to dharr ."
"she was n't exactly sure herself what her reaction to him was so she could n't really describe it to scott even if she wanted to ."
"`` their parents died about five months ago ."
"apparently , the kids are having a very hard time right now . ''"
"`` so what are you going to do about it ? ''"
"scott asked in the silence that followed her revelation ."
"victoria bit her lower lip and stared out the window , unable to face scott ."
"he 'd see the pain in her eyes and she needed to be tough about this situation ."
"`` nothing , '' she said firmly ."
"her words obviously surprised scott since he did n't respond immediately ."
"then she felt his gentle hug as his arms wrapped around her shoulders ."
"`` nothing ? ''"
"`` nope , '' she said and stood up to leave her bedroom ."
"scott followed , watching as she pulled ingredients out for dinner ."
"victoria was the cook generally since scott 's only specialty was sandwiches ."
"`` that 's not like you . ''"
"`` it is now , '' she said , plopping spaghetti sauce down on the counter and vegetables for grilling ."
"`` so you 're not over him , right ? ''"
"scott asked , sitting down at the tiny table in the kitchen ."
"`` the past five years are finally making sense now ."
"that 's the reason you 've never caught a fancy to any of the men i 've introduced you to , eh ? ''"
"victoria spun around at his words , `` what do you mean ?"
"i got over him a long time ago . ''"
"he raised one eyebrow at her heated reply ."
"`` so what 's the problem with helping out his niece and nephew ? ''"
"victoria squared her shoulders ."
"scott could psychoanalyze her responses all he wanted ."
"she would n't change her mind ."
"`` i just wo n't do it ."
"he thinks he can buy anyone and anything ."
"he offered me an astronomical amount to help out the kids ."
"but i 'm not for sale . ''"
"`` so do n't take the money ."
"what do you have to lose ?"
"you do n't have plans for the summer except to model for me , '' he grinned cheekily ."
"`` you could spend the hours writing that book you 've been talking about but you could do that in ashir too without too much trouble . ''"
"he considered her for a moment ."
"`` nope , the only reason you wo n't go is because you 're afraid of him . ''"
"he stood up and walked out of the kitchen ."
"`` you 're afraid you might fall back into his arms again . ''"
"victoria followed him , her mouth trying to form words to deny scott 's assertion that she was easy where dharr was concerned but he interrupted her before she could figure out how to deny his statement forcefully enough ."
"`` by the way , i have a date , tonight so do n't bother making anything for me , '' he said and closed his bedroom door on her glare ."
"victoria stomped back to the kitchen and put the spaghetti sauce and vegetables back into the refrigerator and walked out of the kitchen , furious with him and with the situation ."
"she was n't hungry herself so if scott was going out , there was no need to cook ."
"left alone , she paced the room several times , trying to get her temper under control ."
"she flipped on the television but when nothing interested her , she flipped it off again ."
"a half hour later , scott swung out of his room , patted her head teasingly and blew her a kiss before opening the door to leave ."
"`` wow !"
"deja vu ! ''"
"scott said ."
"`` she 's in the family room , '' scott said and disappeared down the stairs ."
"the hairs on victoria 's neck started tingling and she swung around , terrified to see if her instincts were right ."
"and there he stood , in all his masculine glory ."
"dharr was here , in her apartment , making it seem way too small when his overwhelming size entered it ."
"he looked around disdainfully , noting the mismatched furniture and worn out carpet ."
"`` good evening , victoria , '' he said quietly and closed the door behind him ."
"`` what do you want ? ''"
"she asked , crossing her arms over her chest , painfully aware of the clothes she was wearing ."
"the tee-shirt she 'd pulled on was old and at least two sizes too small but she had n't been expecting company ."
"`` relaxing for the night ? ''"
"he asked , his eyes moving down to her breasts which were thrusting through the thin fabric ."
"`` i like your shirt , '' he said ."
"victoria could feel her nipples harden underneath his knowing gaze ."
"`` what do you want , dharr ? ''"
"she demanded , wishing she was n't blushing right now but not able to control it ."
"`` i thought i 'd already given you my answer earlier today ."
"besides , you mentioned you were flying to germany ."
"why are you still here in london ? ''"
"he walked into the room , looking around at the various pieces of furniture ."
"`` but it was n't the right answer , '' he countered ."
"`` when it is , then i 'll accept it ."
"and i did fly to germany today ."
"now i 'm back . ''"
"her hands were fists at her sides by the end of his announcement ."
"`` you are infuriating . ''"
"`` and you are as beautiful as i remember you being . ''"
"he turned to look into the tiny kitchen but it obviously did n't interest him overly much since he turned back to face her again quickly ."
"`` have you married him ?"
"i did n't notice a ring on your finger so i 'm guessing you have n't yet . ''"
"`` him ? ''"
"she asked , feeling caught off guard ."
"`` your boyfriend ? ''"
"`` boyfriend ? ''"
"dharr sighed and looked at her impatiently ."
"`` the man who just left . ''"
"`` scott ? ''"
"victoria questioned ."
"`` marry him ? ''"
"`` that is what some people do , '' he replied ."
"the whole scene was out of some sort of bizarre movie ."
"`` no ."
"we have n't married ."
"yet , '' she added ."
"if he thought she was going to marry scott then maybe she could have a little pride left ."
"he had n't left her with much last time ."
"dharr raised one eyebrow at her callous reply ."
"`` either you 're committed to him or you 're not , victoria ."
"after all these years , are you so fickle that you ca n't make up your mind ? ''"
"he definitely had a low opinion of her , did n't he ?"
"she walked away , intending to go into her room and put on a different shirt but he stopped her ."
"`` are you ? ''"
"he ground out , holding her wrist in a punishing grip ."
"she looked into his black eyes and wanted to slap him ."
"but she did n't dare ."
"`` yes ."
"i 'm fickle ."
"i just do n't want to settle down with one man , dharr ."
"i like variety and i like men ."
"so why settle for one man when i can have a whole banquet ? ''"
"dharr looked down at her beautiful , furious face and wanted to kiss her soft lips ."
"he wanted to pull off the tiny shirt she was wearing and feel the soft , perfect texture of her breasts ."
"it was as if the old feelings he had for her , the painful sexual frustration was back and more powerful than ever ."
"he had been with many other women since he 'd last seen victoria but none had been able to ease the frustration within him ."
"something inside him made him realize that nothing would until he had this one woman ."
"after so many years , he still wanted her with a painful desire ."
"so when his niece and nephew had started showing signs of problems , victoria had come to mind ."
"he would solve two problems at once , he thought ."
"no matter how much he detested her morals , he knew she could help the kids ."
"and he would make sure she helped him along the way too ."
"it was time for him to settle down but he could n't do that until he 'd exorcised the demons of his past ."
"or at least one demon - in the form of the delectable victoria ."
"and now , he did n't have to slow down as he had all those years ago ."
"she 'd definitely gotten over her fears of sex , he thought ."
"she was obviously living with a man and admitted that she liked variety ."
"well , he 'd give her variety , he told himself ."
"he 'd make love to her so many ways she would n't be able to think straight ."
"and when he 'd finally gotten her out of his blood , he would toss her aside and find someone suitable to becoming his queen ."
"yes , it was a nice , neat plan ."
"kill two birds with one stone , he thought ."
"the hand holding her wrist softened and he stepped back ."
"in order to start his plans , he needed her on his own turf ."
"using intelligence and charm would be better than anger , he told himself ."
"and if that did n't work , he did n't object to paying for what he wanted ."
"after all , had n't life taught him that women were basically all prostitutes ?"
"they all wanted something from him ."
"even if it was simply bragging rights , none of them turned down a pretty trinket , did they ?"
"he just needed to find her price ."
"so start negotiating , he told himself ."
"`` so , do you need help packing ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria 's eyes narrowed ."
"`` you 're not listening , are you ? ''"
"she said ."
"`` i told you earlier that i 'm not going ."
"there are experts all over the world who can help your niece and nephew ."
"pick one and leave me alone . ''"
"he ran a finger down her arm , the gentle caress creating a shiver in her body that she remembered so well ."
"and he felt it , smiled over it ."
"that shiver meant that she still felt all the old chemistry they 'd shared before and it was just as strong now as it had ever been ."
"`` ah , but as i said , i need the best ."
"i need your compassion and directness ."
"these kids have been hurting for so long , it is going to take some real caring to get through to them ."
"from the very first moment i met you , i 've been impressed with your way with children ."
"it is extraordinary , to say the least . ''"
"victoria did n't like the warm glow that eased into her heart at his words ."
"but she pushed that feeling aside , knowing how good he was at getting what he wanted , whether he was telling her the truth or just words so she 'd fall into his plan ."
"`` flattery will get you no where , '' she said , crossing her arms over her chest again ."
"`` not enough money ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` how about double what i offered you previously ? ''"
"victoria 's mouth dropped open ."
"she was stunned by the amount of money he was offering her for only a three month job ."
"but then she remembered that he was a king ."
"and a king to one of the wealthiest countries in the world with oil reserves so deep and vast that they were as yet untapped in some cases ."
"straightening her shoulders , she looked him in the eye ."
"`` you do n't get it , do you ? ''"
"she replied ."
"`` i do n't like you ."
"therefore , you 're going to have to get someone else to help you in this case . ''"
"`` not the right currency ? ''"
"dharr turned around and fingered the dress that was now laying across the back of a chair ."
"`` this looks nice ."
"it should be on the cover of some magazine , should n't it ? ''"
"he said ."
"victoria 's eyes narrowed ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"she demanded , knowing that scott 's hopes were flying high now that there was the possibility of a magazine layout ."
"`` what do you think i mean , victoria ."
"you 're boyfriend only has a layout potential ."
"think about what it would do for him , for your future with him , if he were to get the cover of the magazine instead ? ''"
"victoria gasped ."
"how did he know that an editor was interested in scott 's designs ?"
"was he bluffing ?"
"there was nothing on paper yet ."
"either party could back out , not that scott would even think of doing that ."
"the layout meant a real beginning for him and his designs ."
"`` you do n't have that kind of influence ! ''"
"she said , praying that it was true ."
"dharr walked over to her , standing less than an inch from her delectable body ."
"`` not only do i have the power and influence to get him the cover , i can make the layout disappear ."
"i can also make your job disappear , '' he said , watching her eyes widen ."
"`` i 've done it before when you crossed me , did n't i ? ''"
"it took several seconds for his words to sink in ."
"but when they did , they hit her just like a slap across the face ."
"`` you bastard ! ''"
"she gasped ."
"`` the bookstore did n't lose business ."
"you had me taken off the schedule ! ''"
"`` of course ."
"i told you to quit . ''"
"he continued to watch her face , noting the furious expressions ."
"he said softly , `` do n't cross me , victoria ."
"i can be your best friend , or your worst enemy ."
"and that of all your ... friends , '' he said , hesitating on the last word ."
"he walked over to the door and opened it ."
"`` your last day of school is wednesday ."
"i 'll send a car to pick you up on thursday morning ."
"do n't disappoint me , victoria . ''"
"a moment later , she was standing alone in the apartment ."
"her anger turned to shivers and then into full blown fury ."
"in the end , she just sat down on the sofa and cried ."
"she had n't released so much energy on emotions since he left her that morning and she swore she 'd never let another man hurt her that way again ."
"now that very same man was here , in her life , turning it upside down ."
"and possibly hurting others if she did n't do as he said ."
"around midnight , she slipped into her room , not wanting scott to come back from his date and see her like this ."
"he 'd been through enough emotional upheavals from her to last a lifetime ."
"he did n't need another ."
"and he did n't need his career to be ruined before it even got started if she could do anything to save it ."
"if it was ruined , it would be all her fault anyway ."
"dharr would see to that ."
"life just was n't fair , she thought to herself as she watched the dawn slowly rise over the horizon ."
"she 'd wracked her brains trying to come up with a way to get out of this but each time she came up with a solution , she fell again ."
"it all came down to dharr 's threat to ruin scott ."
"she did n't really care about herself ."
"she could head back to her parents farm and help out the kids in her old village ."
"there were plenty there who needed help ."
"but scott did n't deserve this ."
"he finally had a chance and dharr was threatening to kill it before it started ."
"chapter 6 after a sleepless monday night , her body shut down after school on tuesday ."
"unfortunately , wednesday night , she was too nervous to sleep ."
"she kept packing and repacking her bag , changing her mind on what she would need to bring ."
"in the end , she packed a suitcase full of jeans and shorts with simple tee-shirts , sandals and tennis shoes ."
"at the last minute , she packed a few sundresses , not sure what she would use them for but feeling better and more prepared now that they were in her suitcase ."
"she was going to be with the kids ."
"everything she packed was more practical than flattering ."
"her sole mission was to help two small children who needed help ."
"stripping her suitcase free of any flattering outfits made her feel good ."
"at least dharr would know that she was there for them and did n't have any feelings for him ."
"not even the need to please him ."
"she watched the long , sleek car pull up to the curb and lugged her heavy suitcase down the stairs , not waiting for someone to come up and get it for her ."
"in the back of her mind , she knew it would infuriate dharr ."
"five years ago , he 'd taught her how to allow others to do things for her ."
"she 'd always been uncomfortable with it but had done it to please him ."
"now , she was n't out to please him ."
"she was only here for the kids so his opinion on how to act in front of servants was not her concern ."
"the driver jumped out of the car and tried to take her suitcase ."
"`` no , thank you , '' she said , pulling it along behind her ."
"`` if you 'll just pop the boot , i 'll store it away . ''"
"the driver was dumbfounded and did n't know what to do for a moment ."
"finally , he got his wits and raced ahead of her to unlock the boot ."
"he tried to lift her suitcase for her , but victoria again shook her head ."
"`` no need , '' she laughed and lifted it into the storage space by herself ."
"`` see , '' she said , dusting off her hands efficiently ."
"`` all done , '' she explained ."
"the driver then tried to rush over to the door but victoria again ignored him and opened the door before him , letting herself into the limousine ."
"the hard voice that greeted her startled her ."
"she almost fell onto the seat as dharr said , `` it seems you 've forgotten all the lessons i taught you five years ago . ''"
"victoria flushed ."
"she 'd thought he was only sending the car ."
"she did n't realize that he 'd be picking her up ."
"nevertheless , she rallied over her surprise at seeing him again when she was n't expecting to ."
"`` i never was a good student at silly , pointless lessons ."
"but perhaps the teacher was n't very good , '' she suggested , raising her eyebrows in challenge ."
"dharr 's response to that was to raise one eyebrow ."
"`` perhaps you just need a refresher on everything i taught you , '' he suggested , his smile was lethal in its charm and victoria blushed , knowing he was not referring to how to let the servants help her but about how to please him sexually ."
"well , while kissing anyway ."
"they 'd never gotten to the sex part of things ."
"at least he had n't ."
"her blush intensified when she remembered that morning and the things she 'd let him do to her ."
"her complete surrender was at his fingertips and he knew it ."
"his deep chuckle indicated that he was thinking the same thing ."
"victoria sat back against the plush seats , looking away from him , ignoring him as she watched the london skyline rush by outside the darkened windows ."
"space , she thought ."
"she just needed to keep her distance from him ."
"then everything would be okay , she told herself ."
"and she needed to remind herself that she was here for the children ."
"they were what really mattered ."
"the car bypassed the regular airport entryways and continued on to a restricted area ."
"the car pulled right up to a private plane ."
"victoria 's jaw dropped when she saw that it was n't just a private jet , but a jumbo jet , two stories !"
"good grief , she thought ."
"`` are you going to get out ? ''"
"dharr asked beside her ."
"`` or are you telling me that my company inside this car is more pleasurable to you ? ''"
"victoria snapped out of her shock and realized that the door had already been opened for her by one of his waiting guards ."
"she slipped out , and waited for him to guide her into the plane ."
"she intended to follow behind him , not wanting to assume anything but he put a hand to her elbow and led her onto the plane ."
"he did n't stop until they were in the back , then he led her through a closed door , saying something in arabic to a man standing outside ."
"there , he waved her to a chair and she strapped herself in , uncomfortably aware that they were in a luxurious bedroom , complete with king sized bed and a desk with a computer on it and comfortable chairs in front of and behind it ."
"this room was bigger than her whole apartment , she realized ."
"the flight was uneventful as dharr took several calls , intermingled with telling her about his niece and nephew , about his brother and sister in law and how they died ."
"he also talked about the governess who was in charge of the kids and the woman 's routine for the children ."
"victoria suspected that the first thing that was wrong was the governess and her strict rules but she bit her tongue wanting to observe before she pronounced anything solid ."
"the flight took less time than she thought it would and within what seemed like only a few hours , they were touching down in ashir ."
"victoria looked out the window , watching the desert country pass by the windows ."
"it was beautiful in its harshness and she was impressed that so many people had been able to create a home for themselves under these conditions ."
"but the houses were large and there was a thriving city in the capitol , she realized as the car passed through the town ."
"there were five other limousines and a police escort as they made their way to the palace ."
"once inside the impressive and intimating palace , victoria was led down several hallways that looked to be lined with gold , they glittered so brightly ."
"she was completely lost by the time dharr opened a double set of doors to reveal a large , airy school room ."
"inside , there were two small children sitting at desks ."
"as soon as the doors opened , both children and a stern looking woman stood up and bowed ."
"victoria bowed back to them , not sure what the protocol was in this instance ."
"`` stand up , '' dharr said harshly ."
"`` they are bowing to me , '' he explained ."
"`` oh , '' she said , and a smile appeared on her face ."
"`` sorry . ''"
"dharr 's black eyes sliced over to her face and showed her his displeasure ."
"but victoria was n't looking ."
"her attention was focused on the two , terribly sad looking children staring back at her ."
"dharr said something in arabic that she did n't understand but then reverted to english again ."
"`` may i present , arina and bajan , '' he said and the small girl and boy bowed politely to victoria ."
"`` and their governess , ms ."
"mattingly . ''"
"the three previous occupants of the room only stared at victoria ."
"two small pairs of eyes watched without emotion and the other with what victoria would later learn was hostility ."
"obviously , dharr had n't given the governess any forewarning that victoria was coming , nor did he tell anyone why she was here ."
"without any additional explanation , dharr nodded curtly to the children and ms. mattingly before addressing victoria ."
"`` i shall leave you to your studies , children , '' dharr said formally ."
"`` victoria , report to me daily on your progress , '' he said and left the room ."
"`` i 'll expect to see you tonight at dinner , '' he called out to her as the door closed ."
"with that , he left , the double doors closed behind him by a waiting servant ."
"victoria stood there , wondering what in the world she was supposed to do ."
"he wanted a progress report by tonight ?"
"she looked at her watch and figured it was almost lunch time in ashir ."
"the quiet in the large schoolroom after dharr left was eerie ."
"finally , ms mattingly cleared her throat and straightened her already ramrod straight spine ."
"`` well , we should get back to our studies , children , '' ms. mattingly said ."
"`` take your seats , '' she said ."
"`` if you will excuse us , ms ."
"mason ? ''"
"victoria knew that the governess did n't want her there but the children did n't seem to mind ."
"`` i think i 'll just stay and listen , if you do n't mind . ''"
"the governess pursed her lips but nodded ."
"`` open your books , children , '' she instructed ."
"victoria watched as the children struggled with their lessons ."
"her heart went out to the small children who were sitting so still in their chairs ."
"victoria had never seen a three year old sit still for hours like this ."
"arina should be outside , running and playing , screaming and singing songs in order to learn ."
"the memorization ms. mattingly preferred just was n't as effective as touching and playing and doing , victoria thought ."
"victoria watched without interrupting for the rest of the afternoon but her heart was breaking when she saw that arina 's eyes looked dead and sad ."
"no more mischief within their deep , brown depths ."
"and bajan was just as serious as she 'd thought from his pictures ."
"finally , ms. mattingly closed her books and declared it quiet time ."
"both children stood up and started walking ."
"victoria stood up and smiled ."
"`` ms. mattingly , would you mind if i spoke to the children ? ''"
"she said ."
"the governess walked over to stand next to the children ."
"`` of course , '' she said and waited ."
"`` alone , '' victoria emphasized when the straight laced woman showed no signs of leaving the children for a moment without her guidance and strict discipline ."
"that was not the woman 's choice but pursed her lips and left the room ."
"victoria looked at the two small beings and their sad , pain-filled eyes ."
"`` well , that was a lot of learning today , was n't it ? ''"
"victoria asked , sitting down on the floor and hoping the children would do the same ."
"they simply stood next to her , momentarily looking at her like she 'd lost her head , but then going back to their dead eyes ."
"even a momentary emotion was good , she thought ."
"`` would you like to sit down ? ''"
"victoria asked ."
"the girl thought about it but then rejected the idea but did n't say a word , just shook her head ."
"the boy did n't deign to reply ."
"he obviously had a great deal of his uncle in him and sitting on the floor was simply an unacceptable thing to do , according to the disdainful look in his eyes ."
"victoria was undeterred ."
"`` well , that 's okay ."
"i was hoping you both could help me to pronounce your names ."
"i 'm not very good at your language yet , you know . ''"
"victoria slaughtered their names but the children just politely explained the correct pronunciation without any sort of change in their features ."
"it took almost an hour of being silly before victoria finally got a half smile out of arina ."
"bajan did n't even blink at her silliness ."
"ms. mattinglly came back and excused the children , explaining that it was time for the children 's bath time ."
"victoria followed along , knowing that she was n't wanted but uncaring ."
"at the first sight of the children when she 'd walked into their school room , victoria knew that she was doing this for them , and no longer to protect scott from dharr 's retribution ."
"she went through the rest of the evening with them , ending the day in the children 's dining room where she told silly stories of the animals on the farm she 'd grown up on and the antics of her sister as well as her father who had been known to crack a joke or two when the nights were bitterly cold and there was nothing else to do but stay close to the fire after feeding the animals ."
"the children did n't smile , but at least they paid attention ."
"once they were in bed , victoria was exhausted ."
"all she wanted to do was soak in a tub and go to sleep ."
"but she remembered dharr 's order that she update him on her progress during dinner ."
"she considered ignoring the order but gave in only because he was their legal guardian and victoria knew that he had a right to hear what she thought of their predicament ."
"she asked a servant where to find dharr , wanting to get her `` report '' over with for the day ."
"when she was told he would be in a meeting until later that night , victoria was secretly relieved to have the burden of facing him taken off her , at least for the first day ."
"it was a small reprieve but one she embraced nonetheless ."
"she was instead led to a suite of rooms where she found her luggage ."
"there were three rooms in total and all of them were huge and beautifully decorated ."
"there was a bedroom , a sitting room and a bathroom , all decorated in soft shades of pink , white and cream ."
"in the bedroom , there was an enormous bed covered in silk sheets and thick , fluffy blankets , stacked high with pillows of all shapes and sizes against the headboard that was also covered in pink silk ."
"just outside the bedroom was a sunken living room , filled with comfortable looking sofas and chairs , centered around a marble coffee table ."
"a fireplace was along one wall and curtains shielded what she suspected were windows ."
"but the best part of all was the bathroom ."
"walking in , her eyes were drawn to the huge , sunken bathtub ."
"it was all white marble with pink accents and a shower with several jets right next to the bath ."
"it seemed as if every bone in her body ached from the stress of the past four days ."
"ever since dharr had re-entered her life , nothing had been the same ."
"even her enjoyment of the last few days of school had been tormented with memories of the times she 'd spent with dharr so long ago ."
"hoping for some relief from the tension , victoria turned on the bathtub and stripped out of her worn jeans and shirt ."
"adding bath salts and bubbles from an assortment of items on the side , she slipped into the quickly filled tub ."
"the water was perfect and she laid her head down on the cushioned end , closing her eyes and letting the stress soak out of her body ."
"she was thinking about dharr and the children and dharr 's hands , trying desperately to keep her mind from reliving the details of dharr 's kisses and touch from five years ago ."
"would it be the same ?"
"would she still react ?"
"she was n't going to find out , she determined ."
"she would stay away from him and only report to him in a formal sense ."
"all discussions about the children could be conducted in his office , if he even had an office ."
"she frowned , wondering where the man conducted the state business ."
"perhaps there was some sort of throne room ."
"a shiver went through her ."
"that thought brought home the reality that the man really was royalty ."
"a king !"
"good grief , what had he ever seen in her ?"
"she 'd been so naive and trusting ."
"maybe that was why he 'd considered her 'unworthy ' ."
"sighing , she pushed the memories and uncomfortable thoughts from her mind , knowing she 'd never have the answers ."
"his opinion of her did n't matter anymore ."
"soothing herself by moving the water around , forcing her mind to think only of the children and not of their incredibly handsome , dynamic , arrogant and domineering uncle , she eventually started to relax ."
"the door closing in the outer room alerted her that someone had entered ."
"but who on earth would come in ?"
"probably only a maid coming to turn down the bed , she thought ."
"could they not know that she was already in here ?"
"or had she just imagined the noise ?"
"when she did n't hear anything else , she chalked up the weird sensation to fatigue ."
"she closed her eyes and relaxed , telling herself that no one would dare enter her rooms ."
"security at the palace was extremely tight so she was safer here than she would be at home ."
"`` relaxed ? ''"
"dharr 's deep voice said from the doorway ."
"victoria sat up so quickly the water splashed around , creating waves that sloshed over the side ."
"`` what are you doing in here ? ''"
"she demanded , looking for a towel to cover herself ."
"fortunately , the bubbles were still thick enough to hide her nakedness from him ."
"he leaned negligently against the door frame while he watched her in the bathtub ."
"`` i told you i wanted a daily report ."
"you missed dinner , so i decided to find you instead . ''"
"`` i did n't miss dinner , '' she gasped , pulling the bubbles closer to her breasts ."
"`` i asked a servant where to find your office but they said you would be in meetings for the rest of the night ."
"and i can come talk to you later ."
"please leave , '' she said emphatically ."
"she was trying to sound assertive but she knew her voice just sounded breathless ."
"instead of obeying her command , dharr pushed away from the doorway and walked fully into the bathroom ."
"he took one of the marble seats covered in soft , pink silk ."
"`` what did you think of the children ? ''"
"he asked , looking like he was completely relaxed as he asked about his niece and nephew ."
"victoria swallowed hard , searching the bubbles for holes ."
"`` dharr , please , ca n't we have this conversation in a few minutes ? ''"
"he looked at her in the tub and raised one eyebrow ."
"`` why are you so nervous ?"
"do i make you nervous ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` is it that you 'd prefer me to climb in there with you ? ''"
"`` no ! ''"
"she sat back , eyeing the towels that were sitting right next to him ."
"`` could you just hand me a towel ? ''"
"he reached out his arm , extending the towel to her but not getting up to deliver it as she 'd hoped ."
"`` happy to oblige , '' he said ."
"in order for victoria to reach the towel , she 'd have to get out and walk the ten feet to him ."
"there was no way she would do that in her present , naked , state ."
"victoria sat back , glaring at him ."
"if he was n't bothered by their situation , then she could at least pretend she was n't ."
"she would n't give him power over her ."
"`` you 're niece is wonderful but needs to smile more ."
"your nephew is a piece of work , wrapped in stress and wondering how he can shoulder the awesome responsibility of raising his sister all on his own . ''"
"dharr blinked at her statement ."
"`` but he does n't need to do that , '' dharr countered ."
"she raised her eyebrows at him , showing him her opinion of his perception ."
"`` have you told him that ? ''"
"she argued ."
"dharr looked confused ."
"`` no ."
"why should i ?"
"he knows that i 'll take care of him . ''"
"victoria shook her head ."
"`` no , he does n't ."
"children are black and white ."
"their world only makes sense on their level , not necessarily on ours ."
"so in his mind , his mother and father are gone , that means he 's the man of the house . ''"
"dharr considered her words carefully and victoria was surprised when he did n't contradict her again ."
"`` that 's an interesting perspective , '' he conceded ."
"`` i 'll think about what you said ."
"what will you do tomorrow ? ''"
"victoria sighed , thinking about the governess ."
"`` i do n't know ."
"can i spend some time playing with them alone ?"
"not just a small span of time but for perhaps half the day ? ''"
"`` why would you want to do that ? ''"
"victoria looked stunned ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` do n't you get tired of them ? ''"
"he asked , curiously ."
"victoria smiled , understanding at last ."
"`` ah , you 're one of those . ''"
"`` what of what 'those ' , '' he challenged ."
"`` one of those people who thinks children should be seen and not heard ; and only at appropriate , limited times during the day . ''"
"`` of course , '' he replied as if that was the most obvious thing in the world ."
"victoria eyed him suspiciously but then saw the amusement in his eyes ."
"`` no you 're not ."
"you just do n't know any differently , do you ? ''"
"she refused to laugh , hating that he could still do that to her ."
"he could be a horrible tease , she remembered ."
"dharr chuckled and moved closer ."
"`` i 'll admit that my parents did n't play with me much ."
"but i do n't think some commingling of adults and children would be inappropriate ."
"as long as you are there to supervise , '' he challenged ."
"he stood up and walked closer to the bathtub ."
"victoria was n't overly concerned , thinking he was actually leaving and she could get out of the tub ."
"it was becoming uncomfortably hot , what with the warm water and dharr 's gorgeous body so close and his intense , sexy eyes watching her closely ."
"but he did n't stop his momentum towards the tub when she thought he should be turning towards the doorway ."
"`` dharr , what are you doing ? ''"
"she asked , all the nervousness she 'd been holding at bay came rushing back to the forefront now that he was much too close to the bathtub ."
"`` it is time for you to get out of the tub , '' he claimed ."
"`` dharr ! ''"
"she snapped , watching his hand move to the faucet ."
"`` what are you thinking of doing ? ''"
"`` i 'm going to let the water out ."
"you 're here as my guest and i am honor bound to take care of you ."
"i ca n't let you become too water-logged , '' he explained as if that were the most obvious action in the world ."
"`` do n't you dare ! ''"
"she squealed ."
"but he dared ."
"all the time ."
"with a simple press of a button , the drain to the bathtub opened up ."
"`` dharr ! ''"
"she gasped , frantically searching for a towel or a washcloth , anything that would cover her up ."
"`` there 's a towel beside the bench over there , '' he explained , still bending down close to the bathtub ."
"his dark eyes were filled with amusement and mischief and something she did n't dare define , too afraid it would be desire ."
"the water drained out of the tub and she watched in horror as dharr walked patiently over to the stack of thick , pink towels ."
"he unfolded the top one and held it open for her ."
"`` you 're going to have to come out sooner or later , '' he chuckled ."
"`` you 're a bastard , '' she said , glaring at him but still frantically watching the water which was quickly draining away ."
"`` so you 've mentioned before ."
"now be a good girl and come out of there ."
"after all , you 're not afraid of me , are you ? ''"
"victoria scooped up as many bubbles as she could , holding them in front of her primly ."
"she did n't care how silly she looked but rushed over to the open towel ."
"she tried pulling it out of his hands , but his strong , muscular arms only closed around her , thankfully covering her up but now she had a new problem ."
"and this one was more painful than the last ."
"the towel was closed , covering up her nakedness but dharr 's hands were holding it there ."
"his chest was pressed against hers and his arms were pulling her close , pressing her hips against his ."
"`` you can let go of me , '' she said breathlessly , worriedly looking up into his face ."
"`` i do n't think i want to , '' he said , his eyes were staring at her lips ."
"`` do n't , '' she said , knowing where his thoughts were going and hoping she could dissuade him somehow ."
"but even to her own ears her voice lacked conviction ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` do n't tell me you do n't wonder if it would be like it used to be between us , '' he said softly ."
"`` you remember , do n't you ?"
"at the first touch of our lips , the heat would fire and you 'd be in my arms , begging me to touch you , needing the next step , but terrified of what that next step would be . ''"
"his eyes were watching the flush steal into her cheeks and her mouth open slowly as she tried to form a response ."
"`` you know what that next step would be now , do n't you ?"
"and you want it , from me . ''"
"`` i do n't , '' she claimed ."
"he took one hand from her back and put it against the pulse beating on her throat ."
"`` you 're lying , '' he said ."
"`` i wonder why ."
"why would you be so afraid of what we can share between each other ? ''"
"`` because i do n't like you . ''"
"he smiled at her adamant reply , knowing she was nervous about what he could make her body feel ."
"`` well , that 's the funny thing about chemistry , '' he soothed , the hand touching her throat moved upwards , to rest against her cheek , stroking her full , lower lip sensuously ."
"`` it does n't really take our 'likes ' into account when revealing it 's ugly head , does it ? ''"
"victoria was starting to realize he was right ."
"she fought it , she really did ."
"but then his hand moved down from her back where it was holding the towel , he pushed the terry cloth away and rested against her skin instead , rubbing her skin and starting a fire wherever he touched ."
"at the first contact , victoria gasped and tried to arch away , but his other hand moved from her mouth , down to cover her breast , his thumb rubbing against the nipple through the thick terry cloth ."
"every sensation was coiling inside her , pooling in her stomach , then sending liquid heat between her legs ."
"`` you feel it , do n't you , victoria ? ''"
"he said softly ."
"before she knew what was happening , the towel was gone and she was leaning against him , her naked flesh revealed to his fully clothed body ."
"she felt his erection against her stomach and a part of her was terrified , but she wanted him ."
"she accepted that she 'd never wanted any other man ."
"it was crazy but she could n't deny it ."
"`` you want me , do n't you , '' he said , whispering in her ear before nibbling on her earlobe ."
"`` you 're not thinking about anyone else , are you ? ''"
"victoria stopped cold with his words while all the frustrations of the past five years came rushing back to her ."
"why on earth would he want to know if she was thinking about someone else ?"
"then it came to her , his words earlier that she was sleeping with scott and he must think there had been others ."
"he thought she was promiscuous !"
"she pushed away from him with all her strength and thankfully caught him off-guard ."
"`` do n't do that ! ''"
"she cried and picked up the towel , throwing it around her and then rushing from the room ."
"she ran into the bedroom and stood there , shaking and waiting for him to come out ."
"when he did , her body started shaking even more ."
"he walked towards her , his stride determined and the look in his eyes telling her that he was furious ."
"she held one hand out in front of her while the other held the towel firmly in place ."
"`` do n't come near me , dharr ."
"we 've had this conversation before and i wo n't let you do that to me again ! ''"
"she said , holding her hand out like a shield ."
"but he just took her hand in his and pulled her against him ."
"`` you 're fooling yourself if you think you can ignore what is going on between us , victoria ."
"i allowed you room before but that was my mistake ."
"i learned from that adventure into hell ."
"believe me , i wo n't let us travel down that road again . ''"
"he started to walk out of the room and then stopped ."
"turning back to her , he glared at her ."
"`` was he the first ? ''"
"she was shivering so violently she could barely hold the towel ."
"his words did n't make sense to her sexually frustrated and terrified mind ."
"`` what the hell are you talking about ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"`` was who the first ? ''"
"the idea that he 'd been fooled all along had eaten into his psyche for the past five years ."
"and now he had to know ."
"he 'd suspected it for so long , suspected that she 'd only been stringing him along hoping for more ."
"but it had n't made sense ."
"she had n't taken anything from him , even to the point of cooking him meals in an effort to maintain her side of the relationship ."
"good grief , she fought against even take a cell phone from him ."
"but he had to know if she really had been a virgin when he 'd initially met her ."
"had all her innocence and resistance to his position and wealth been a lie ?"
"was she really that good of an actress ?"
"`` was that night the first time '' he demanded , `` or were there others before him ? ''"
"`` you 're insane ! ''"
"she claimed , still not understanding what he was accusing her of ."
"a cruel smile twisted his mouth in response ."
"`` you 're probably right but that still does n't answer my question , '' he stated emphatically ."
"`` were there others ? ''"
"`` i 'm not answering that ."
"it is none of your business ."
"it never was , '' she said , lifting her chin and glaring right back at him , refusing to give in to his intimidation tactics ."
"the fact that she would n't tell him answered for her ."
"she condemned herself with her silence and that only infuriated him further ."
"she would prefer to share her body with others rather than become his wife and the mother of his children ."
"turning on his heel , he left her , slamming the door in his wake ."
"chapter 7 the following morning , victoria walked into the children 's breakfast room a servant had directed her to and stopped short ."
"sitting at the table looking incredibly sophisticated and sexy , casually drinking coffee was dharr ."
"and he was having a very serious conversation with his nephew ."
"bajan was talking about his responsibilities and arina was listening intently ."
"dharr nodded his head at certain points in the conversation but most of all , he allowed bajan to talk ."
"she stood in the doorway , feeling like an intruder but unwilling and unable to step back ."
"she 'd mentioned last night that she suspected that bajan was taking on the responsibility of raising his sister alone and dharr had listened to her , actually listened !"
"what 's more , he was acting on that piece of information ."
"the pain twisting her stomach after last night eased somewhat ."
"victoria realized that whatever dharr thought of her as a woman , he respected her professionally ."
"and that was something ."
"and going from nothing to something was a heady experience for her ."
"she listened intently as bajan continued to talk and her heart went out to the little man who was discussing how best to take care of his sister and dharr nodded his head earnestly ."
"bajan was serious but also very intelligent and well spoken for a boy of his age ."
"`` i think you have some good ideas , bajan , '' dharr was saying ."
"`` but maybe you could let me help you with some of the issues you may be facing in the years ahead of you , '' he said ."
"`` i 'm not saying that in all instances i should interfere , but perhaps i could guide you like my advisors guide me . ''"
"bajan considered this and , after several moments , he nodded his head ."
"`` i would be grateful for your guidance , uncle dharr , '' he said ."
"once that was settled , dharr turned to face arina ."
"`` and what is on your mind , little one ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she looked around , noting that her governess was far enough away to not overhear the conversation ."
"`` i 'd like a doggy , '' she whispered ."
"the words came out as if she knew that such an idea was forbidden ."
"victoria heard the words and she smiled secretly , loving the intent expression of the little girl ."
"but the expression on dharr 's face was equally priceless ."
"`` a doggy ? ''"
"he said loudly and victoria understood his horror ."
"she tried not to smile but it was too precious to see dharr 's face ."
"she stifled a giggle and covered her mouth ."
"`` well , what would you do with a doggy ? ''"
"he asked , maintaining the serious facade ."
"arina shrugged her shoulders and looked down ."
"`` i do n't know , '' she revealed ."
"her eyes , which had shown a small spark of excitement , died down and the sadness returned ."
"`` maybe it was a silly idea . ''"
"dharr looked up , straight at victoria , obviously having known all along that she was there and listening to the conversation ."
"his look was a call for help ."
"he 'd been doing so well up to that point and victoria hated to intrude , but she understood that dharr did n't understand what he should say in this instance ."
"victoria stepped into the room and sat down next to the little girl ."
"she started talking about her dog harry she 'd had at home ."
"turning to arina , she suggested , `` do you want a dog so you can have something to keep forever ? ''"
"she asked ."
"arina thought about it for a long time , then slowly nodded her head ."
"then in the middle of her nod , she shook her head ."
"`` but nothing lasts forever , '' she said ."
"victoria shook her head ."
"`` i 'm not sure i agree with that , '' she said ."
"four sets of eyes looked up at her ."
"she concentrated on the small set of brown eyes that were looking up curiously ."
"`` think about it , '' victoria said ."
"`` you miss your mother and father , do n't you ? ''"
"she said ."
"arina nodded but she noted that bajan lifted his head slightly , fighting the need to reveal his pain ."
"`` but do you think about them ? ''"
"again , arina nodded her head ."
"ms. mattingly stepped in at that point ."
"`` i do n't think this is an appropriate conversation , '' she snapped ."
"`` i agree , '' dharr said ."
"but victoria ignored them ."
"`` well , think of your memories of your mother and father ."
"what 's the one thing you remember the most ? ''"
"she asked , turning to arina first ."
"arina looked to ms. mattingly , then to dharr who slowly nodded his head ."
"given permission , arina pursed her lips , thinking hard ."
"after several minutes , she whispered , `` bedtime kisses . ''"
"`` what did your mother smell like ? ''"
"victoria asked softly ."
"`` flowers . ''"
"victoria smiled encouragingly , feeling a huge sense of relief that she was breaking through , even in a small way , with arina ."
"`` and what did she feel like ? ''"
"`` soft , '' bajan stepped in ."
"arina looked over at bajan , wanting to cry but knowing her brother would n't do it , therefore , it was probably inappropriate at the moment in her eyes ."
"`` think about those feelings ."
"i guarantee that they will last forever , '' victoria said ."
"she then clapped her hands together gently ."
"`` know what ? ''"
"she said and all four sets of eyes looked up at her again ."
"`` your uncle has given me permission to play with you for the morning ."
"what do you think of that ? ''"
"victoria asked , looking at both children ."
"both of them turned to face ms. mattingly who nodded her head ."
"`` if his highness has approved the interruption , then i suppose it is okay . ''"
"dharr stood up and bowed ."
"`` i leave you both in ms. mason 's hands ."
"mind your manners and behave , '' he said sternly ."
"when both children nodded in response , dharr turned on his heel and left the breakfast room ."
"as soon as he left , ms. mattingly also departed , although her body language conveyed the message that she disapproved of the interruption to her daily schedule with the children ."
"arina and bajan both stared at victoria who just grimaced after the stern lady 's departure ."
"`` she 's pretty tough , is n't she ? ''"
"neither child agreed , nor would either of them crack a smile ."
"`` can either of you show me to the play room ? ''"
"victoria asked , searching for something that would break through their silence ."
"`` i 'd rather not spend our short time together in the school room and i do n't know the palace well enough to suggest another place where we can get to know each other . ''"
"they led her down the hallway to a sunny , wonderful room filled with lovely toys for all ages ."
"it took a while , but eventually , victoria got them to engage in the toys ."
"as they played , she talked to them , getting them to slowly start to talk about their feelings and their grief ."
"but at lunchtime , ms. mattingly arrived and halted the play , escorting the children to the schoolroom where victoria sat and observed , fuming at the woman 's need to control little people who were supposed to wriggle and squirm ."
"instead of waiting for dharr to come to her that night , she sought him out , waiting outside his office this time until he finished his meeting ."
"she did n't want another repeat of the previous night 's interrogation ."
"unfortunately , she did n't have much to report ."
"but she promised to keep trying ."
"as soon as the discussion was over , she hurried out of his office , almost running to her suite of rooms in order to avoid dharr ."
"that 's how the whole first week went ."
"the children did n't open up very much , nor did she do so to dharr ."
"she refused all dinner invitations , explaining that she 'd rather eat with the children but some nights , she ate in her own room , not able to deal with ms. mattingly 's sternly disapproving demeanor any longer ."
"saturday morning , ten days after her arrival , she had a breakthrough of the most amazing kind ."
"she was sound asleep when she heard the door to her suite open ."
"turning , she was about to pull the sheets up over her revealing tee-shirt when she heard the small footsteps ."
"it was arina ."
"she was staring at victoria 's sleep drugged face , tears streaming down her chubby , beautiful cheeks ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"she asked , pulling the little girl into her arms , cradling her and rocking her back and forth ."
"`` arina , please tell me what 's happened , '' victoria begged , genuinely worried about the small , shaking little girl in her arms ."
"`` i miss my mommy , '' she whispered as if it were an awful secret ."
"`` oh , dear ."
"i 'm so glad , '' victoria said , pulling the child closer to her ."
"`` i know , sweetheart . ''"
"`` you know ? ''"
"the child asked , looking up into victoria 's face ."
"`` how did you know ? ''"
"victoria smiled through her own tears ."
"`` arina there 's no way anyone could lose their mother and father and not feel sad , '' she said ."
"`` but i 'm supposed to be strong , '' she said , laying her head against victoria 's chest ."
"`` who said ? ''"
"victoria asked carefully ."
"if dharr or ms. mattingly had said that to her , she would absolutely contradict them ."
"but if bajan had given her that admonition , then victoria knew she 'd have to step carefully ."
"victoria did n't want to hurt the impression arina had of her brother 's strengths , but she did n't want the little girl to keep the hurt inside either ."
"`` ms. mattingly said so , '' the small voice whispered ."
"`` she said we have to be strong and keep on working at our studies so we can grow up to be smart leaders . ''"
"victoria hoped the anger she felt for the governess did n't show on her face ."
"she looked gently down at the small child in her arms and thought carefully about how victoria could ease the child 's burden ."
"`` sometimes it is a good thing to cry , arina ."
"being strong means revealing your feelings , '' she said ."
"`` it means knowing that something is wrong and letting others help you , '' victoria said , sobbing herself now that arina was crying out desperately , her pain wracked body shaking with her grief ."
"a moment later , bajan stood next to her bed ."
"`` do you mean it ? ''"
"he asked , fighting the tears that were threatening ."
"`` but uncle dharr does n't reveal his feelings , '' bajan argued ."
"victoria could see that the boy was trying valiantly to hold back his tears but she would n't let him ."
"`` oh yes he does , '' she said ."
"`` you just need to know how to read him , '' she said ."
"victoria did n't tell him that she herself did n't know how to read their uncle ."
"it was enough that the boy climbed immediately into bed with them and started crying ."
"the two children cried for over an hour , neither wanting to talk , just to be held and let go of the pain they had been living with for almost seven months ."
"eventually , they fell asleep , bajan 's hand holding onto his sister 's arm but his other wrapped around victoria 's waist ."
"arina 's hand was holding onto victoria 's hand and both of hers were around each child ."
"that was how dharr found them ."
"he had been told by ms. mattingly that the children had disappeared and the whole palace was searching for them ."
"some instinct had told dharr to look for victoria and he 'd find the children , but he had n't thought to look in her bed ."
"now , seeing the three of them , sound asleep , his heart ached and he let out a sigh of relief ."
"the children were safe and victoria was still here ."
"dharr did n't analyze why it was so important that victoria was still within in the palace walls ."
"he just left her suite , closing the door softly behind him ."
"the summons came that afternoon ."
"she 'd been spending time with the children , not letting ms. mattingly have them but simply playing with them in the play room and encouraging them to talk about their memories of their parents ."
"victoria looked at the note written in dharr 's strong handwriting ."
"it was simple and to the point ."
"he asked her to meet him in his office at her earliest convenience ."
"the odd thing was that he actually asked her to meet him ."
"it was n't an order ."
"victoria did n't like the nice tone ."
"it was too patient ."
"that just was n't like the dharr she had come to know she thought , holding the note in her hand while arina carried a baby doll over to her ."
"what was he playing at ?"
"she decided to go immediately ."
"she did n't think she could stand the curiosity so she found a servant to watch over the children , then she left the school room and headed towards dharr 's offices ."
"as soon as she arrived , she was waved into his office which was odd in itself ."
"was n't he in meetings or needing to finish up whatever he was working on ?"
"she was used to waiting for him , at least for a few minutes ."
"this immediacy was odd ."
"she entered and looked around , impressed despite herself ."
"the office was furnished in dark , heavy furniture but because of the enormous size of the room , it did n't look cluttered ."
"the whole room was two stories high with floor to ceiling windows on each end looking out onto a courtyard ."
"his desk was the largest piece and was made of dark , polished wood ."
"it sat in front of a long wall of shelves filled top to bottom in books ."
"the remaining wall had the doors to the outer offices as well as other doors that were mysteriously closed ."
"there were also large paintings of battles or portraits that were so perfectly rendered they had to be priceless ."
"standing in the middle of all of this grandeur was dharr himself , looking more like a king than she 'd ever thought him to be ."
"it was scary to think that she 'd dated the man for more than six weeks , had kissed him and touched him , fell in love with him and learned so much from him but during that whole time , she 'd never known he was ruler to ashir ."
"now , looking at him in this amazing room , there could be no doubt about his role in the world ."
"he was a ruler , born and bred ."
"it showed with every mannerism and posture ."
"how could she have missed all these things so many years ago ?"
"because if she 'd realized he was a king at that time , she would have run the other way ."
"she had n't wanted him to be anything other than a normal man ."
"that meant that she was free to be with him ."
"each time she 'd started to think he might be more than what he was letting on , she 'd dismissed the idea as too far fetched ."
"but deep down , she had n't wanted to acknowledge that he was out of her league ."
"`` good afternoon , '' he said , putting down the report he had been reading ."
"`` are your rooms adequate ? ''"
"this formal man standing before her was unfamiliar ."
"`` yes ."
"they are very nice , '' she replied , just as formally ."
"why was he asking her this when she 'd been here for almost two weeks already ?"
"something was up ."
"she just could n't figure it out yet ."
"`` good ."
"how are the children ? ''"
"he asked ."
"this was familiar ground for her ."
"she relaxed slightly and considered all the issues she 'd unraveled today ."
"`` i think they are fine ."
"i just left them in the school room . ''"
"`` you do n't like ms. mattingly , do you ? ''"
"he questioned ."
"victoria hesitated for only a moment before replying , `` no ."
"i think she is part of the problem . ''"
"`` in what way ? ''"
"he asked , waving her into a seat ."
"victoria looked down and took one of the large , leather seats grouped around a coffee table ."
"`` would you like some coffee ? ''"
"he asked , lifting an elaborate silver coffee pot , prepared to pour her some ."
"`` no ."
"thank you . ''"
"she sat on the edge of her seat and looked around at the various paintings , the beautiful furniture , anywhere but at the handsome but completely intimidating man in front of her ."
"`` i think she is a perfectly adequate teacher for older students but for a three year old and a six year old , they need to be more active ."
"i 've never seen children that age sit still for so long . ''"
"his eyebrows came down into a straight line across his dark eyes , as if he disagreed with her on this point ."
"`` is n't that a good thing ? ''"
"he asked ."
"her eyes whipped back to his and she answered , `` of course not , '' without thinking of a more diplomatic reply ."
"he was surprised , but did n't take issue with her immediate contradiction as she had anticipated ."
"`` please explain . ''"
"she needed to choose her words carefully so he would understand ."
"arina and bajan needed her to be able to get through to dharr so they could be free of their strict , daily routines ."
"she started off slowly , `` children that age need activity ."
"their brains do n't work the same way an adult 's does ."
"they need to see , hear , feel , possibly taste the things they are learning ."
"the more ways a person absorbs the information , the better it will stay in their minds ."
"rote memorization is n't the best way to learn . ''"
"he smiled slowly ."
"`` you 're very passionate about your ideas , victoria ."
"i do n't remember you being this strong minded . ''"
"victoria flushed , thinking back at how pathetic she must have seemed , trying to please him at every turn ."
"`` i guess i 've grown up and developed opinions of my own ."
"i do n't care if you do n't like it , '' she said , her chin lifting a fraction of an inch as a challenge ."
"`` and what if i do ? ''"
"he asked softly ."
"that confused her ."
"the admiring glance also made her warm inside but she ignored that feeling , knowing that he was just trying to charm her ."
"`` i 'm not here to please you , dharr ."
"i know the rest of the world lives and breathes to please you but you wo n't get that from me , '' she said , her eyes turning angry at the idea ."
"`` ah , but victoria , you please me a great deal ."
"just your beauty alone is lovely to look upon , '' he replied ."
"her mouth dropped open and she had to look away from his sensuous expression ."
"his eyes were still hard , but they had a look that told her he was thinking about other ways she could please him ."
"his finger smoothed along his lower lip and victoria 's mind wondered what it would feel like to have that finger touching her lip , caressing her body ."
"stop it !"
"she told herself ."
"it was pointless to go down that path ."
"there was no way she was going back to him and besides , he had n't indicated that he was even interested in her in any way other than professionally ."
"`` as i said , flattery will get you no where , '' she said again and looked away ."
"her whole body was reacting to the thought of his touch , remembering the heat and the pleasure he could give her with only a simple touch ."
"`` anyway , if there is nothing else , i 'll get out of your way ."
"i 'm sure you have plenty of work to do . ''"
"she stood up and started to leave but his next words stopped her ."
"`` actually , there is one more thing , if you have a moment , '' he said , standing up with her ."
"that meant that their bodies were close and he looked down into her green eyes , holding her hand to stop her momentum ."
"`` there is a function tomorrow night ."
"i was hoping you would be able to accompany me . ''"
"`` why ? ''"
"she asked , her hand shaking within his ."
"she could n't help it ."
"dharr being arrogant and domineering was hard to resist ."
"but dharr being nice and charming was devastating to her senses ."
"`` why do you need me there ? ''"
"`` you are my guest and i was thinking it would give you a chance to meet some new people , enjoy the night and relax a little . ''"
"he took her hand more firmly within his and tucked it into his arm as he escorted her to the door ."
"`` but if you do n't think it would be a good idea , then i will find another woman to accompany me , '' he said ."
"victoria 's eyes snapped up to look at his , trying to determine if he was serious ."
"when she just saw his blank , patient expression , she knew that he was n't bluffing ."
"her heart went into overdrive ."
"the jealousy tearing at her was instantaneous and blinding ."
"`` you are seeing someone ? ''"
"she asked , hoping he could n't hear the anger in her voice ."
"she wanted to pull her hand free and find the woman , do her physical harm ."
"it was shocking to know that she hated someone she had n't even met , did n't know even existed until this moment ."
"her feelings were ridiculous since she had no claim to dharr ."
"nor did she want one , she told herself ."
"but there was no denying the jealousy tearing her up ."
"dharr noted the anger in her eyes and instantly recognized it as jealousy , just as he 'd suspected and hoped ."
"`` i 'm not seeing anyone at the moment , '' he reassured her ."
"`` but i need a companion for the night and was hoping you could help me in this instance . ''"
"`` fine , '' victoria snapped , angry now that she felt such overwhelming relief ."
"`` yes , '' she replied more graciously for fear that he would think she was doing this grudgingly and go find another companion ."
"she just could n't deal with the idea of another woman on dharr 's arm ."
"`` i 'll be happy to help you out tomorrow night , '' she said quickly , adding a smile ."
"`` what time ?"
"is it formal ? ''"
"`` it is formal but i 'll have something appropriate for you to wear sent over ."
"there may be other events later in the week that perhaps you might help me with as well ? ''"
"he questioned ."
"`` but if they become a burden , just let me know and i will find someone else to accompany me for those events . ''"
"victoria gritted her teeth and shook her head ."
"`` no need ."
"the children go to sleep early and i can accompany you ."
"after all , i do n't have much to do in the evenings , do i ? ''"
"she felt good that she could turn down his offer of a dress ."
"even though she now knew he was a king with probably oodles of money , she did n't want to be indebted to him ."
"`` as for a dress , no need to have one delivered ."
"i think i have something appropriate . ''"
"she waited for him to contradict her on that subject ."
"in the past , he had been adamant that she accept gifts from him , even an allowance ."
"but even then , just as now , she wanted to stand on her own and not accept his money , even in the form of an appropriate dress for a formal event ."
"dharr bowed slightly and smiled ."
"`` i appreciate your help . ''"
"victoria smiled back but did n't bow ."
"she accepted his bow and left his office , an odd feeling in her stomach ."
"she refused to identify the feeling as excitement ."
"it was just nausea she told herself ."
"she held herself proudly until she got out into the hallway , then leaned against the wall , closing her eyes and shaking her head ."
"`` what have i gotten myself into ? ''"
"she questioned out loud ."
"hearing a noise at the other end of the hall , her eyes snapped open and she saw several people heading towards dharr 's office ."
"scrambling to pull herself together , she hurried back to her suite ."
"making a quick phone call , she left a message for scott , telling him he needed to send some dresses to her as soon as possible and the way to get them here ."
"she told him to send them via overnight mail and she 'd have them pressed once they arrived ."
"she was sure that there was a dry cleaning facility somewhere around here that would press the dresses quickly ."
"she just hoped scott got the message in time ."
"the next thirty six hours were the most stressful of victoria 's life ."
"she received a package the following morning and sure enough , scott had sent her five different dresses ."
"she recognized all of them since she 'd modeled them for him in the past ."
"it meant they would all fit her perfectly since he 'd created them for her ."
"they were n't really wrinkled either but one of the servants promised that they would be pressed and back in her closet for the evening event ."
"that night , she chose a mint green creation that was n't too revealing but hugged her upper body with soft folds , creating a v down the front and back , then flaring out into a graceful cascade of mint green chiffon to the floor ."
"it was very romantic looking and was one of her favorites ."
"she remembered how scott had had her hair done for the photo shoot and tried to recreate it , but in the end , she just left the soft curls hanging down her back and only lifting the sides with small , green clips ."
"scott had hired a hairdresser for all the photo shoots and , although the hairstyle had looked easy enough to recreate , it obviously was n't ."
"she was glad she 'd gone to all the trouble when dharr arrived to escort her to the party ."
"his eyes flared as he took in her figure clad in the soft dress ."
"he did n't say anything , but she knew that he liked the dress ."
"why it was so important for her , she was n't going to even think about ."
"he tucked her hand into his arm and walked her down the hallway , explaining that there were several ambassadors and their wives here for the evening ."
"he was entertaining them in order to work their treaties for better terms for ashir and some of the negotiations had turned slightly sticky ."
"the evening turned out to be wonderful ."
"she did n't sense any tension from the other guests in the room ."
"there were about fifty people , all fabulously dressed and loaded with jewels ."
"some of the older ladies were even wearing white gloves to their elbows which was a sweet throwback to the nineteen fifties ."
"she 'd have to mention the thought to scott as an accessory to one of his newer creations ."
"what was more , dharr did n't let her out of his sight ."
"he kept her close , included her in all of the conversations and asked her opinion on several issues ."
"it was completely different from five years ago ."
"she had never been introduced to anyone important at that time and dharr had tried to mould her into the kind of woman he wanted her to be ."
"it seemed he respected her now , and liked what she had to say ."
"at the end of the night , victoria started to become nervous ."
"dharr 's hands were touching her back and , although she tried , she could n't contain a shiver of excitement over his touch ."
"she did n't want to be excited ."
"she wanted to be immune to his touch , his charm ."
"once the last guest had departed , victoria tried to slip her arm out from his ."
"she was a bundle of nerves and she wanted nothing better than to slip into his arms and feel his lips on hers ."
"`` i have to go , '' she said instead ."
"`` i 'll walk you to your room . ''"
"`` no ! ''"
"she said , stopping him and putting a hand to his chest ."
"she immediately whipped it away , then took a step backwards ."
"`` no , thank you , '' she finally got out , biting her lower lip ."
"`` i 'll be fine . ''"
"`` but i insist , '' he countered ."
"`` dharr , i can find my way to my room , '' she said and started walking down the hallway ."
"he fell into step beside her and walked with her anyway ."
"at her door , he turned her around but did n't kiss her ."
"instead , he picked up her hand and bowed low ."
"`` thank you for your assistance tonight , '' he said ."
"`` can i count on you again tomorrow night ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria thought about how she 'd felt next to him all night ."
"she 'd been supremely conscious of him as a man and of all the women looking at him ."
"there were the looks of envy as well as those of approval ."
"she 'd ignored all the jealousy , tossing it aside ."
"`` dharr , why do you need me ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` you can work the room quite well on your own . ''"
"he took a step closer , trapping her hand between their bodies ."
"his eyes showed her the passion that had been tamped down for her benefit ."
"but now , he did n't hide anything ."
"it was all there , letting her know that nothing had changed between them ."
"the chemistry was still intense and ready to be acknowledged ."
"`` because i want you by my side ."
"because i think you are incredibly beautiful with intelligence and wit ."
"and because if you wo n't accompany me , i 'll have to find a replacement and that will make you jealous and , although there are many feelings i want to engender within you , that is not one of them . ''"
"he kissed her hand and then stepped backwards ."
"`` i 'll see you tomorrow night ."
"again , thank you for a lovely evening . ''"
"victoria slipped into her room and almost fell onto her bed before her legs gave out on her ."
"what was it about the man that made him completely irresistible to her ?"
"why could n't she just think of him as any other man she 'd met ?"
"victoria was in a quandary ."
"being around him meant feeling things she knew were bad for her in both the short term and long term ."
"but if she did n't accompany him to these functions , he would find someone else ."
"and that thought just tore her up inside ."
"either way , she was doomed ."
"she would just have to be strong , she told herself ."
"the children had been fighting their emotions for so long , perhaps she could take a lesson from them ?"
"she could hide her feelings for dharr and the way his touch made her feel ."
"yes , that would work , she told herself ."
"chapter 8 the next day , victoria arrived in the school room , dreading the next passive aggressive confrontation with the sour governess ."
"but instead , she found arina and bajan playing in the school room ."
"and laughing !"
"they were actually laughing ."
"it was music to victoria 's ears ."
"the servant , named gita , was down on the floor , doing a puppet show with them ."
"victoria had no idea what they were saying since they were currently speaking in arabic , but she suspected it was just a silly play ."
"victoria found out that the severe ms. mattingly was dismissed the previous day ."
"victoria was grateful to dharr for really listening to her ."
"the evidence was in the fact that the children were currently laughing and enjoying themselves instead of sitting straight and learning something that was developmentally beyond their abilities to comprehend ."
"unfortunately , that meant that victoria would have to go see dharr yet again and thank him ."
"she did n't want to but she could n't think of an alternative ."
"she considered sending a note , but that seemed too impersonal for what he 'd done for the children ."
"sighing , she knew she 'd have to seek him out and thank him ."
"bracing herself for being near him again , she started the long walk through the palace to his offices ."
"she gave herself a pep talk , trying to convince herself that she could be nice , polite , direct and grateful and not lose herself in the man 's charm and charisma ."
"she would maintain a distance of several feet , knowing that even a small touch from him without a crowd around her would make her body respond in ways that she knew were better left unexplored ."
"who was she kidding , she thought when she entered the outer offices and asked if he was available for a moment ."
"victoria grimaced inwardly , remembering how her body had reacted to his touch last night even when they were surrounded by fifty other people ."
"and she was excited about being with him tonight ."
"she wanted him to keep her near , to feel his touch on her back and smile down into her face as he listened to her opinion ."
"`` his highness will see you immediately , '' dharr 's assistant replied as soon as he 'd announced that victoria was here to see him ."
"dharr watched as victoria walked into his office ."
"as soon as she was inside and the door closed behind her , he could see the wariness in her eyes ."
"and it made him feel good ."
"he did n't like her being wary of him , but he knew that it was because of what he could make her feel ."
"slow , he told himself ."
"he needed to take it slow ."
"she was like a tiny hummingbird sipping the nectar but ready to take flight at the slightest sense of danger ."
"and instinctively , she considered dharr dangerous ."
"she was right ."
"he meant to have her ."
"one way or another , he would have her in his bed and would find out what he had missed out on all those years ago ."
"a small spark of anger fired inside his chest when he remembered that he would n't be the one to initiate her into the world of love making as he 'd wanted to so many years ago , but he would enjoy her body none the less ."
"perhaps it was better this way , he thought as she slowly approached his desk where he was standing , watching her ."
"he considered her more beautiful now than she had been initially ."
"there was something about her , a maturity , a confidence perhaps , that only enhanced her loveliness ."
"and back then , he was starting to feel something for her ."
"now , he would make sure it was only sex ."
"good sex , he told himself ."
"he smiled and knew it was a ferocious smile because he was thinking of all the ways he would enjoy her incredible , sexy body ."
"she was smart too ."
"he 'd made a good choice when he 'd gone after her to help his niece and nephew ."
"there had been many other people who would have done an adequate job ."
"but he 'd wanted her ."
"after seeing victoria with the children , he knew that her methods were much better than the governess 's strict controls ."
"`` good morning , dharr , '' she said , stopping on the opposite side of his desk `` good morning , victoria ."
"to what do i owe this unexpected visit ? ''"
"he asked , noticing that she kept her hands behind her back ."
"he suspected that it was because they were shaking but he did n't mind ."
"the action only served him more since it thrust her breasts outward , giving him a delightful view of their round firmness ."
"`` i just heard that you released ms. mattingly from her contract ."
"is it true ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"you said she was part of the problem ."
"so she is no longer employed by me . ''"
"victoria nodded , feeling wonderful that he accepted her advice so willingly and completely ."
"`` i 'm grateful ."
"and so are the children ."
"they were watching a puppet show put on by gita , one of the palace servants , when i left them ."
"they were laughing , '' she smiled , excited to tell him the news ."
"`` they were actually smiling and laughing , dharr ! ''"
"she said , clasping her hands in front of her and almost jumping in her exciting news ."
"dharr grinned , more entranced by her than by the news that his niece and nephew were progressing ."
"he 'd known that would happen eventually ."
"children were resilient ."
"he considered correcting her use of his first name but then rejected the thought ."
"he 'd allowed her to call him that since their first meeting although no one else but his immediate family had that privilege ."
"he wondered if she knew how few people were allowed to address him that way ."
"he did n't think she did ."
"nor would she care if he told her ."
"`` that 's good news , '' he said ."
"`` i 'm sure they are well on their way to a full recovery ."
"thanks to you . ''"
"victoria flushed with pleasure at his praise and looked down at the desk , unable to hold his intense gaze ."
"`` well , i guess i 'd better get back to the children , '' she said haltingly ."
"`` do you still need help tonight ? ''"
"she asked , her eyes seeking his out , hoping that he did need her again ."
"she hated to admit it , but she was looking forward to seeing him tonight and feeling his arm around her back and waist ."
"`` yes , if you are still able to accompany me , i would be grateful for the assistance , '' he replied ."
"`` absolutely . ''"
"she looked up , then down again , biting her lip in indecision ."
"`` well , then , i guess i 'll head back , '' she said , feeling silly standing there looking at dharr ."
"he just looked so incredibly handsome in his charcoal suit ."
"the jacket was tossed over a chair beside his desk but his crisp , white shirt stretched across his broad shoulders ."
"her eyes dropped to his arms which were crossed over his chest , the cuffs of his sleeves folded back so she had a glimpse of his muscular forearms ."
"`` was there something else ? ''"
"dharr asked softly ."
"he could see her eyes and knew that she was looking at him ."
"but would she dare to admit it ?"
"he leaned forward , his eyes giving her permission to look all she wanted ."
"but in the end , she simply shook her head ."
"`` no ."
"that 's all ."
"i 'll see you tonight , '' she said quickly then turned on her heel and walked out of his office ."
"dharr enjoyed the view of her long legs and firm derriere encased in the slim fitting jeans ."
"when the door closed behind her , he finally looked away , smiling inwardly ."
"she wanted him and that was obvious ."
"but how did he get her to act on those feelings ?"
"dharr turned and stared out the window , considering all he had learned that morning ."
"he wanted her , that was a given ."
"but although she was making progress with the children , he was n't making any progress with her ."
"he had brought her here with the dual purpose of helping the children but also exorcising her ghost ."
"and he 'd made no progress to date ."
"it was time to change that ."
"he smiled mercilessly ."
"she 'd said a few days ago that the children needed him to be around more often ."
"well , if that 's the case , he would do it ."
"and if victoria just happened to be there as well , then he would make the best of that situation ."
"he 'd listened to her advice so far and the children were recovering with leaps and bounds ."
"he 'd just continue to listen , and act , on her advice ."
"victoria wore a simple , black cocktail dress that night ."
"she 'd pulled her hair back into a knot , tightly pinned at the base of her head ."
"she smiled brightly to him when he arrived at her door ."
"`` what 's the occasion tonight ? ''"
"she asked , falling into step with him as he led her through the hallways of the palace ."
"`` tonight is more relaxed , '' he explained ."
"`` it is only a few ceos and their wives who are old acquaintances ."
"i think you 'll like them . ''"
"`` old acquaintances ? ''"
"she asked , hoping he would elaborate a little more ."
"`` college friends , '' he said ."
"`` there 's lord alfred manning and his wife sarah and prince jeffrey asam and his wife jasim ."
"i went to school with alfred and jeffrey . ''"
"`` ah , '' she said , understanding but her nervousness increased slightly ."
"this was n't an affair that he would need a companion , was it ?"
"and if it was n't , what did that mean about her presence tonight ?"
"could he just want her to be with him ?"
"a delicious feeling swelled inside her ."
"and true to his word , the evening was definitely fun and relaxing ."
"they ate out on a beautifully decorated veranda ."
"jeffrey and alfred were handsome and charming men who were obviously in love with their wives ."
"victoria noticed that the men did n't like their wives to stray too far , and their wives were n't immune to their husbands either ."
"the meal was delicious as usual and the laughter put victoria more at ease than she 'd been since dharr 's arrival at the school ."
"she loved hearing stories about dharr and the trouble the three men got into while at oxford ."
"and if dharr treated her exactly like his friends treated their wives , she just accepted it , feeling included and accepted ."
"chapter 9 the next night , three startled eyes looked up from their picnic , worriedly watching dharr as he approached their blanket ."
"`` good evening , '' he said , looking down on the little party ."
"`` what are you eating tonight ? ''"
"dharr asked , bending down to take the only available space on the blanket ."
"victoria tried to move out of his way , but his hands stopped her , keeping her right where she was , which was almost touching him along his leg ."
"arina spoke up , seriously telling him about hot dogs and potato salad ."
"it was their first experience tasting the american delicacy and they were excited about the prospect ."
"`` hmm ... i had that once , ' he said , looking into victoria 's eyes , his own on fire with the memory ."
"he dipped a fork into the bowl and nodded his head ."
"`` yep , no celery , '' he confirmed ."
"`` how did you ... '' victoria started , only to stop when he winked at her ."
"`` i remember , victoria , '' he said softly , grinning at her in a teasing fashion ."
"`` i remember a lot of things . ''"
"victoria stopped staring at him , forcing her eyes to look away ."
"throughout the whole meal , dharr 's hand `` accidentally '' touched victoria in one way or another ."
"and each time , she felt the same electric current zip through her system ."
"by the time the meal was over , she was breathing heavily and she could barely control the need to throw herself into dharr 's arms and beg him to make love to her ."
"she wanted him ."
"desperately ."
"no matter how much she told herself that he was a bastard who had killed all the soft , tender feelings she 'd had for him five years ago , there was still the sexual chemistry between them ."
"it had always been intense , at least on her part ."
"she 'd known he could control his feelings for her but she 'd been too new at the sexual games to understand what was happening to her ."
"and now , even after all these years and all the frank , open talk from others , she still was new to the game ."
"and he was an expert ."
"no matter how much she tried to put herself out of his touching reach that afternoon , he found a way to brush her arm or knee ."
"he never looked at her , but each time it happened , her eyes snapped to his face , trying to determine if it was intentional or not ."
"it seemed innocent enough , but she suspected otherwise ."
"victoria almost yelled out a protest when one of the palace servants arrived to get the children ready for bed ."
"she did n't want to be alone with dharr ."
"it was n't just the chemistry now ."
"being around him with the children , her heart had melted , seeing his tender care and understanding to the two small human beings that were aching inside for love and security and he just naturally gave it to them ."
"the depths of his personality struck her hard and she wished she had n't seen this side of him ."
"it only made the wanting harder ."
"when they were alone , victoria reached down to start cleaning up the picnic ."
"`` leave it , '' dharr ordered ."
"victoria ignored his command and continued to clean up the food , storing it in the picnic basket ."
"dharr grabbed her arm and swung her around ."
"`` are you deliberately trying to rile my temper ? ''"
"he asked , but she could see the amusement in his eyes as he held her wrists gently in his hands ."
"`` no ."
"but i do n't believe in forcing someone to clean up after me ."
"i can clean my own messes , '' she said and tried to pull her wrists out of his grip ."
"but it was useless ."
"`` you really do n't remember anything i taught you all those years ago , do you ? ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"she challenged , wishing she could control her heartbeat which was accelerating as he pulled her closer ."
"`` that i should ignore common decency and become a selfish bastard like you ? ''"
"dharr did n't rise to the bait but only chuckled at her anger ."
"`` first of all , i 'm afraid i 'll have to take away that one epithet from you , my dear ."
"i can give ample evidence of my legitimacy ."
"do n't despair though ."
"i 'm sure there are many other obscenities you can toss at me each time you reach the depths of frustration . ''"
"he chuckled as her eyes flared at him ."
"he could see the wheels spinning in her mind as she tried to come up with another name to fling at him ."
"`` second , there were many things i taught you ."
"if you 're saying you 've forgotten , then perhaps i could refresh your memory , '' he said ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she tried to step away from him but he held her firmly but gently , not giving her and inch of space ."
"he looked down into her desire filled eyes , knowing that the sexual frustration was tearing her up inside just as it was doing to him ."
"`` ah , victoria , you 're mouth says no , but your body is saying yes , is n't it ? ''"
"`` no , '' she claimed and tried again to pull out of his embrace ."
"`` which is louder ? ''"
"he asked , pulling her relentlessly closer to him , so close that she could feel his breath on her cheek , feel the beating of his heart under her hands as she tried to push herself away from him ."
"but it was no use ."
"he was stronger and , although he was n't hurting her , she could n't break away ."
"and her body was already betraying her , sinking in to lean against his hard , male strength , loving the way he felt against her softness and desire pooling in her stomach , then lower ."
"`` please do n't do this , '' she gasped when his hand released her wrist and moved down to her waist , one hand slipping under her shirt to touch the heated , overly sensitized skin underneath ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"he asked , his mouth bending to kiss her neck , finding the perfect spot that almost made her knees give out on her ."
"`` because we do n't like each other , '' she said , her voice barely a whisper as he moved his mouth sensuously against her neck and shoulders ."
"`` i like you a lot , victoria . ''"
"`` no you do n't ."
"you think ... . ''"
"she could n't finish the sentence and her eyes fluttered shut at the memory ."
"`` i 'm not thinking now , '' he said softly ."
"`` except about how to please you ."
"how to touch you to give you the most pleasure ."
"what would you like me to do ?"
"where should i touch you ? ''"
"victoria could n't respond verbally but when his thumb found her nipple and moved gently across , she gasped , her hands gripping his shoulders as she was unable to stand any longer ."
"she heard him laugh softly but could n't respond ."
"dharr did n't wait ."
"he lifted her in his arms and carried her down the hallway to her suite ."
"victoria had a small moment of sanity but by that time , he was already lowering her feet to the floor beside her bed and when she opened her mouth to protest , his own covered hers , ripping away anything she might have said in a maelstrom of feeling and desire ."
"victoria whimpered as her shirt came over her head , leaving her with only her bra to cover her breasts ."
"but she did n't have time to become self-conscious as dharr 's hands covered where the fabric had been only moments before , massaging the heated , overly sensitive flesh that was swelling to fit into his hands ."
"her nipples were already hard and pointing so when his hand covered them , his thumb flicking over each one , she cried out with the pleasure that coursed through her system ."
"`` dharr ! ''"
"she gasped ."
"he lowered her body to the bed , but stood up to discard his own shirt ."
"victoria was thrilled , never having seen him without his shirt on before ."
"she 'd seen other men , of course ."
"scott on a daily basis at times ."
"but no man she 'd ever seen could compare to the muscular beauty of dharr 's chest ."
"the hair was sparing across the top , then headed to a narrow point that disappeared into his pants ."
"with infinite tenderness , dharr reached down and pulled her jeans off her legs , his eyes lighting with fire when he saw her long , slender legs revealed to him ."
"she laid there in just her cotton bra and underwear , wishing she had something sexy on instead ."
"but dharr came down on top of her , his mouth moving to hers again and all her insecurities disappeared with the touch of his tongue against hers ."
"victoria 's hands reached out , curious and free at last to touch the man who had so fascinated her that she 'd never been interested in anyone else ."
"the muscles bunched under her fingers wherever she touched and she ran her fingers along his arms , his chest , into his hair and then back down to test the crisp hair on his chest , her fingers tangling in it and then moving lower , following the interesting line that disappeared ."
"she heard dharr suck in his breath when she stopped at his belt ."
"he suddenly stood up and ripped his belt loose , his pants flying behind him before he came back to the bed , completely naked ."
"without a word , he pulled her hand down to where it had stopped before ."
"`` please continue , '' he said and his voice was hoarse ."
"victoria was only too pleased to comply and her hand moved along his flat stomach , impressed with the ridges of muscles along the way ."
"but her hand stopped suddenly ."
"she could n't go any lower ."
"her eyes could n't even look to where his erection stood , hard and proud , waiting for her touch ."
"she glanced up at him , worried that she 'd been too brazen ."
"but his eyes were closed , his teeth clenched in anticipation ."
"`` do n't stop , victoria , '' he rasped ."
"`` do n't tease me like this . ''"
"with those words , her hand moved lower , her fingers touching the tip tentatively , worried that she might hurt him ."
"when she touched him , he let out a hiss of air and victoria pulled her hand back instantly ."
"only to have his own hand reach out and pull hers back , wrapping her fingers around him firmly ."
"when her fingers moved , dharr groaned and leaned forward , taking her nipple into his mouth yet again , sucking hard , moving the plain , white cotton away and teasing her nipple more ."
"with each nip or suckle , victoria 's fingers clenched harder or relaxed , depending on what he was doing to her ."
"she forgot what she was doing , lost in the desire he was pushing her into ."
"she did n't realize that her fingers were driving him to distraction and he was losing his much prized control , the control that had been drilled into him from the moment he 'd had his first woman at the age of twelve ."
"here , with victoria 's clumsy hands touching him , clenching at his flesh , he was no longer the experienced lover he 'd prided himself on being ."
"he felt new and raw , overwhelmed with the desire to sink his aching flesh into her and pound until he found his release ."
"pulling her hand away , he grabbed both of her hands and lifted them over her head , determined to make her pay for wanting her so desperately ."
"she thought she was in control !"
"well he would turn the tables ."
"no , he would control this experience and would show her that he was the ultimate lover ."
"he would make her forget all the other men she 'd had in the past and he 'd teach her what she 'd thrown away so callously ."
"with her hands in one of his , he flicked the front clasp of her bra , releasing her perfect , beautiful breasts from the plain cotton ."
"his indrawn breath showed him that she was still in control and he hated that feeling ."
"lowering his head , he took her nipple in his mouth , moving his lips gently over the rosy peak , then sucking again , blowing his breath against her puckered skin , then starting over ."
"when she started writhing beneath him , he moved to the other perfect mound , doing the same , smiling when she cried out and tried to pull her hands from his grasp ."
"but he would n't relent ."
"not yet ."
"he moved down her body , kissing her stomach , his tongue delving into her belly button and glorying in the cries that came from the simple movement ."
"but he wanted more ."
"his hand moved between her thighs , first on the outside , then moving up the inside and he thrilled that she opened to him ."
"he could smell her arousal and it made him hurt even more ."
"but he was n't finished ."
"not yet ."
"one hand moved to her core , flicking her nubbin and watching the flush steal across her breasts ."
"he remembered how quickly she had found release the last time and almost gave in with the need to enter her , but he held back , wanting to show her again how good it could be ."
"his finger slipped inside her wet folds and he had to close his eyes to concentrate once he felt how wet she was , how ready for him ."
"`` what do you want , victoria , '' he asked and his voice was rough , demanding ."
"`` tell me ."
"does this feel good ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` yes , '' she gasped ."
"`` please , '' she whimpered , still pulling at her hands that were in his grasp but settled on her stomach now ."
"`` not yet , '' he said ."
"dharr needed more ."
"he did n't just want to feel , he wanted to watch , to taste it when she had her first orgasm tonight ."
"it had happened too fast the last time ."
"this time , he 'd take her slowly into the pleasure ."
"his tongue flicked over her folds and his hands released her wrists ."
"he moved between her legs , loving the feeling of her hands in his hair , pulling and pushing at the same time ."
"and just like the last time , her orgasm was upon her before he could slow it down ."
"dharr watched , more aroused than he 'd ever been in his life as he watched and tasted her orgasm ."
"when her cries died down , he moved up her body , kissing her stomach , moving upwards to caress her breasts with his hands , his thumbs , his mouth and tongue ."
"there was no peace for her , he thought , winding her up for the next level ."
"and when her eyes opened in surprise , he laughed ."
"`` yes , victoria ."
"we 've only just begun , '' he said , pulling on a condom , and held her hands over her head again as his body slid up against hers , his erection finding her softness and pressing inside ."
"he looked at her eyes , widening in shock and then in pleasure as he slid in deeper , filling her up ."
"there was a small restriction and dharr looked down at her , his throat constricting as he understood what it was ."
"but by then it was too late ."
"he broke through her barrier , noting the small twinge in her eyes and stiffening of her body before she relaxed again ."
"her legs moved up and wrapped around his waist and her hands pulled free of his , resting on his shoulders as he buried himself to the hilt ."
"victoria was a virgin ?"
"it was madness surely ."
"impossible !"
"but the evidence was incontrovertible ."
"and now he was fully inside her , the only man to ever be in this position with this incredible beauty ."
"the responsibility he felt at that moment was awesome ."
"it had to be perfect ."
"dharr started moving , slowly , sweat breaking out on his forehead as he moved , requiring only to give her the most incredible experience of her life ."
"he ignored his body 's own need for release and simply moved to help her ."
"just as it had moments ago , her body responded , and within moments , her second orgasm was consuming her ."
"he felt her muscles tighten a moment before she screamed out , her nails biting into his skin on the shoulders and back ."
"he held back for only another moment , his pleasure increasing as he watched her mouth open and her body arch as the orgasm carried her off ."
"and then he could hold back no more ."
"he pounded into her silken flesh , finding his release a few minutes later ."
"it was as if all the tension of his life drained out as his body poured itself into hers ."
"it was the longest orgasm he 'd ever experienced and he held victoria close ."
"when it was all over , he rolled onto his back , taking her with him , still intimately connected ."
"his hands dove into her hair and he stared up at the ceiling , his breathing still ragged as he considered all the ramifications of the past few minutes ."
"`` dharr ? ''"
"victoria asked , her head resting against his chest and her hand laying against his rapidly beating heart ."
"`` is it always ... . ''"
"she could n't find the words to describe what had just happened ."
"`` no , '' he replied harshly ."
"just thinking about her response had him growing hard again ."
"her head came up and he rolled back over ."
"`` no ."
"it is n't like this normally , '' he grated out ."
"a moment later , the whirlwind started again ."
"this time , it was more intense , and victoria pushed her head back and forth against the sheets , the pleasure almost reaching the painful stage before she tumbled over the edge , once again crying out and holding onto dharr as the waves of her orgasm crashed over the two of them ."
"victoria slept , unable to do anything else since her body was so replete ."
"dharr 's love making was so thorough and complete , she had nothing left in her afterwards ."
"dharr watched her , noting the dark circles under her eyes and the perfect rose tinge to her cheeks ."
"she curled up against him , laying her head on his shoulder while her hands wrapped around his arm ."
"it was as if she felt in sleep what he was currently feeling wide awake ."
"he did n't want to lose her ."
"with complete honesty , he knew that this was the reason he 'd come to her for help with his niece and nephew ."
"there were probably hundreds of childhood experts he could have employed but he 'd gone back to her ."
"he 'd never gotten her out of his mind after all these years ."
"and he 'd wanted to finish what he 'd started with her , even if it meant he would n't be her first ."
"after five years , he had acknowledged that he had n't cared ."
"but now , seeing the evidence of her virginity on the sheets , he 'd obviously made a huge mistake five years ago ."
"she 'd been pure and honest with him and he 'd tried to destroy her ."
"he remembered the confused and hurt look in her face when he 'd stood up , callously straightening his tie as if he was completely impartial to what had just happened ."
"walking out of her bedroom that morning had been one of the hardest things he 'd ever had to do in his life ."
"and now , seeing her beautiful face relaxed in sleep , a sleep caused by her first experience with sex , he regretted it even more ."
"dharr waited until he was sure she was asleep before slipping out of the bed ."
"he left her sleeping , unable to endure the incredible pleasure of her sweet , warm body curled up next to his ."
"he wanted desperately to kiss her awake , to make love to her once again ."
"but he knew he needed to think , to come up with a plan to make it up to her for what he 'd done to her before ."
"he also needed to put into motion what he 'd started before ."
"he would never let her go again , he promised ."
"he 'd show her all that he could offer her and somehow , he vowed , he 'd find a way to keep her in his life forever ."
"chapter 10 victoria woke the following morning to bright sunlight streaming over her face ."
"she stretched languorously , feeling happy and content ."
"delirious , in fact , she thought as she rolled onto her back and stared up at the ceiling ."
"then the memories of the night before came streaming back to her and victoria 's face started burning ."
"looking around , she searched for dharr , wondering what he was thinking about her behavior from the night before ."
"would he think she was wanton ?"
"he must , she thought ."
"since she had been , there was really nothing else the man could think of her ."
"she was embarrassed but knew she 'd have to get the first morning contact with him over quickly ."
"but all she found was a long , slim jewelry case where he should have been ."
"with shaking fingers , victoria pulled the case closer to her , feeling a cold chill steal into her veins ."
"what could this mean ?"
"why in the world would he leave in the middle of the night ?"
"even the case was a work of art , she thought , running her fingers over the soft , embossed leather ."
"opening the box , she gasped , seeing the spectacular glittering diamond bracelet inside ."
"`` how could he ! ''"
"she said to the empty room , slapping the box closed and tossing it to the side as if it were some sort of serpent ."
"the tears formed and immediately fell down her cheeks as his message came through ."
"well , she 'd been wondering what he thought of her and now she knew ."
"payment for services rendered , she thought , shaking her head in denial ."
"last night had been so incredible , so passionate and she 'd allowed it !"
"and he 'd left her , just as he would an alley prostitute , leaving payment on the bedside ."
"oh !"
"of all the arrogant , offensive evil things he could have done , this was the ultimate slap in the face ."
"at least the last time he 'd touched her he 'd had the dignity to insult her to her face ."
"he had n't even given her that much this time ."
"she was obviously unworthy of his time now ."
"oh , how she 'd lost herself in the moment last night and now , to find this awful message from him ."
"it was worse than the last time ."
"five years ago , he 'd said she was unworthy but she had n't understood his meaning ."
"now , he leaves this awful bracelet that was probably worth a fortune but the message was loud and clear ."
"she jumped out of the bed and showered as quickly as possible , wishing she could just leave and run away ."
"she needed to lick her wounds and hide for a long time ."
"she would just pack up and leave ."
"he 'd done it to her the last time ."
"why should n't she give him the same response ?"
"if he thought so little of her , then she could give him the same courtesy back ."
"what a fool she 'd been !"
"she 'd just fallen into his arms , letting him touch her and kiss her ."
"she felt filthy and as the hot water cascaded over her aching body , she scrubbed her arms and body , trying to rid herself of the memory of his touch ."
"she hated him !"
"she cried through the whole shower , scrubbing herself harder when the memory of how it felt when he 'd touched her would n't go away ."
"pulling out her suitcase , she started throwing things in , not even bothering to fold them ."
"jeans and tee shirts were piled up , underwear and socks came next and she just lifted them out of her drawer and stuffed them into the suitcase as fast as her arms would permit ."
"she did n't have to be subjected to that kind of humiliation again ."
"it was too much ."
"but then arina and bajan came to mind ."
"what would happen to all the progress she 'd made with them if yet another person disappeared on them ?"
"they would be devastated ."
"until she could transfer their feelings from her to dharr , then she just could n't leave them ."
"that realization was devastating to her ."
"she sat down on the bed , her shoulders shaking as the pain seeped into her body once again ."
"she even hated to admit that her feelings for dharr were n't hatred , but were love ."
"she loved him desperately ."
"and this time , it was a mature love ."
"she admired him for what he 'd done with his country and how he treated two , small , orphaned children ."
"she loved the way he made her laugh , even when she wanted to be angry with him ."
"but this time , she did n't have scott or jasmine to help her out ."
"she was on her own ."
"somehow , she 'd have to find the strength inside herself to keep him from crushing her again ."
"pulling on a pair of jeans and a regular white tee-shirt , she grabbed the hated box and left her suite ."
"she did n't even care that she did n't have makeup on ."
"she was too angry and too determined to show him that she did n't care what his opinion of her was ."
"she stopped the first servant she could find and asked about dharr 's whereabouts ."
"if she were n't so angry , she would be amused by the expressions on each palace servant 's face ."
"it was as if dharr 's location were a closely guarded secret and only the people who already had appointments were permitted to know where and when he would see them ."
"undeterred , victoria assumed that he would most likely be in his office at this time of the morning , although she was n't exactly sure what time it was since she 'd forgotten to put on her watch ."
"her tennis shoes were basically silent as she walked along the corridors to his office ."
"she stormed in and stood in front of his personal secretary ."
"this man was n't the usual one that sat outside , guarding dharr 's office from intruders ."
"she had no idea where the other man was and did n't care right at the moment ."
"she only had one mission in mind and anyone who stood in her way was going to regret it , she told herself ."
"`` i need to speak with dharr , '' she said , her voice quivering with her anger and humiliation at the hands of the same man twice in her lifetime ."
"the man simply stared at victoria , dumbfounded for a long moment ."
"`` his highness is unavailable at the moment but i 'll be happy to make an appointment with you at his earliest convenience ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she said and hated the fact that tears started to form in her eyes ."
"`` find him now and tell him i want to speak with him immediately . ''"
"`` i ca n't do that , madam , '' the man said stiffly ."
"`` it simply is n't done . ''"
"victoria wiped the tears from her eyes angrily and shook her head ."
"`` it is done today ."
"call him !"
"if you do n't , i 'll just walk right into his office , guards or no guards ."
"and then they 'll get in trouble for touching me , it will be a huge mess ."
"so why do n't you just tell him i 'm out here waiting and we can avoid an ugly confrontation . ''"
"something about the way she was holding herself or perhaps her words sunk in to the man and he responded ."
"he quickly picked up the phone and said something in arabic ."
"it sounded very apologetic but a moment later , he put the phone down and nodded his head ."
"`` his highness will see you now , '' the man said , standing up and bowing politely ."
"victoria already knew where his office was , having gone there every day to report her progress with the children ."
"so she walked quickly down the hallway and shoved open the doors ."
"she found him , standing behind his desk , arms crossed over his chest and two other men scurrying out of his office , closing the doors behind them ."
"`` this wo n't take long , '' she said and slapped the box into the middle of his enormous desk ."
"`` do n't you ever do that to me again ! ''"
"she said , and wiped another tear down her cheek ."
"`` i am not something you can ... . ''"
"she struggled to get past the words ... . ''"
"that you can just purchase , like some ... . ''"
"she stopped , tried to gain her composure and failed ."
"she covered her face in her hands and sobbed , her shoulders shaking with her humiliation ."
"when she felt him touch her shoulders , she snapped back ."
"`` do n't touch me ! ''"
"she said and backed away ."
"`` i hate you for that , '' she said , pointing to the box on his desk ."
"`` i 'm not a wh ... . ''"
"`` stop it ! ''"
"he snapped ."
"`` do n't ever say that again , '' he demanded ."
"`` do n't ! ''"
"she said and shook her head ."
"`` you ca n't speak to me like that !"
"i hate you ! ''"
"she whispered , wishing she could yell at him , punch him , hurt him the same way he 'd hurt her ."
"but he seemed impervious to anything she said ."
"`` just leave me alone , '' she said and ran down the hallway , leaving the doors open in her wake ."
"she did n't care that she left horrified palace staff members gaping at her ."
"she was probably the only person who had ever spoken to the king of ashir in that manner but she did n't care what they did to her ."
"if they shipped her off , then at least she 'd be rid of that horrible man and the future of the children would n't be on her shoulders ."
"thinking of arina and bajan , she hurried to find them , wanting to be with them and find some solace in their innocence and goodness ."
"she found them in the playroom , giggling and pretending with dolls and dinosaurs ."
"as soon as she entered , they both stood up , then smiled broadly when they realized it was her and not another servant ."
"`` good morning , victoria , '' arina exclaimed , running into victoria 's arms , hugging her tightly ."
"`` what are we going to do today ? ''"
"she asked excitedly ."
"bajan was more circumspect with his enthusiasm but he followed , his eyes showing victoria that he was just as excited about the day as his sister ."
"victoria considered her options ."
"she had to get outside , fearing that dharr would locate her if she stayed in the palace ."
"but why would he bother ?"
"did n't the bracelet say everything he needed to say ?"
"pushing back her depression , she bent down and sat cross legged on the floor , hugging bajan who leaned against her , still not able to hug someone himself , as if he considered it a weakness , but needing the physical contact regardless ."
"`` how about if we go out and you can both introduce me to your horses ?"
"did n't you mention that they 'd been neglected recently ? ''"
"both jumped up and were thrilled with the idea ."
"they took her hands and led her out of the play room ."
"they walked through so many hallways , victoria was completely lost by the time they entered the bright sunshine ."
"visiting the stables was the perfect idea , she thought as they both led her toward their favorite animals ."
"after being introduced to the horses , then feeding them , brushing them and basically learning more about the animals than victoria ever wanted to know , they discovered a small stall that had no horses in it , but something just as exciting ."
"a litter of kittens had been born about two weeks earlier and were playing in the hay ."
"victoria and the children huddled around them , enjoying the small creatures and petting their soft fur ."
"they spent the rest of the morning just playing with the kittens and finding food for them , not leaving until all six of them settled down and fell asleep on top of one another ."
"the three of them trotted happily back to the palace and victoria decided to take the children to the kitchens for lunch ."
"there was no need for a servant to bring them something when they could just as easily , and more happily , make something for themselves ."
"the chef was horrified that the prince and princess of ashir would enter his kitchens ."
"victoria was equally shocked to think of her two small charges in that way ."
"she 'd only thought of them as a small girl and boy , but she realized that they really were royalty since they were the children of dharr 's brother , who was also a prince ."
"it was the second time in her life she 'd treated someone as just another person , uncaring of their position within the world ."
"but this time , she was n't going to listen to some ridiculous chef spouting silliness about how it was beneath them to step into the kitchen , much less make their own meal ."
"being fed up with arrogance and pompous attitudes , victoria simply demanded peanut butter and jelly so they could make a sandwich ."
"when she took that attitude , the items were quickly delivered ."
"victoria , arina and bajan made such a mess out of a simple sandwich process , they giggled and made a bigger mess ."
"by the time the sandwiches were finished , each of them had jelly in their hair and peanut butter on their noses and cheeks , not to mention all over their fingers ."
"victoria cleaned up the mess , then they took their sandwiches to the portrait studio ."
"victoria decided to let the children talk about their ancestors and see how their parents fit into the whole history of ashir ."
"the children were extremely knowledgeable about their history and they sat down underneath their father 's picture to eat ."
"they were silent and stared up at him , munching their sandwiches and sipping milk ."
"victoria led them back to the playroom where a new teacher had arrived and was excited to meet her new charges ."
"initially , the children were afraid to be left alone with the teacher so victoria stayed with them , simply sitting in the back of the classroom ."
"but when the woman , named ms. kiri , asked them to come with them to the front of the room and sit down on some pillows to read stories , play with puppets , victoria soon found herself superfluous ."
"she was also impressed with the teacher and wanted to make herself scarce so the teacher would n't feel pressure by being observed ."
"she stepped out of the school room , only to bump into the one person she had been trying to avoid all day long ."
"without saying a word , dharr grabbed her wrist and walked into the school room ."
"his eyes snapped to the empty desks and turned to face her ."
"`` where are they ? ''"
"he demanded in a low , angry voice ."
"`` where are who ? ''"
"victoria asked , trying to yank her arm free but her efforts only caused her more pain ."
"`` the children !"
"what have you done with them ? ''"
"`` what are you accusing me of now ? ''"
"she asked , stopping her efforts and standing up to him , as much as she could with him towering over her ."
"`` the children are sitting up there with their new teacher , entranced by her story and having a wonderful time ."
"dharr 's surprise showed on his face and he yanked her forward ."
"when he saw the children , completely undisturbed by their argument , he pulled her along behind him ."
"once they were out in the hallway , he turned her so she was facing him ."
"`` where have you been all day ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"victoria was still hurt and furious about the night before and she was n't about to take this from him ."
"`` i 've been out shopping and spending all of ashir 's money ."
"i hope you do n't mind , '' she continued sarcastically ."
"then the anger rushed back and she could n't stop herself from asking , `` where do you think i 've been ? ''"
"he pulled her closer , turning her so she was fully facing him now ."
"`` do n't play , victoria ."
"you were supposed to have gone down to the stables but when i went there to find you , no one knew where you were ."
"you did n't bring the children for lunch in the dining room and were gone for over an hour since the last servant saw either hide nor hair of you ."
"so i 'll ask again , where in the hell have you been ? ''"
"victoria remembered how much she hated him ."
"`` i hate to disillusion you about how awful a person i am yet again , your highness , '' she said with a sneer , `` but your palace spies really are n't very good at their job ."
"i 'd recommend either a refresher course or a whole new entourage of spies if these ca n't do the job . ''"
"she was about to shut her mouth but the furious look in his eyes and the muscle twitching on his jaw told her she might have gone too far ."
"`` we went to the stables and played with the kittens ."
"you probably did n't see us because you 're nose is too high in the air or maybe because you 're mind is relentlessly in the gutter ."
"and then , '' she went on when she saw that he was going to say something , `` we went to the kitchen and made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches ourselves ."
"after that , we went to the portrait gallery and looked at the picture of your brother ."
"the kids were silent but would n't take their eyes off of him . ''"
"she ended with a lowered tone and the shock inside dharr loosened his hold so she was able to pull free easily ."
"`` what awful things were you thinking of this time ? ''"
"she asked , rubbing her wrists and glaring up at his surprised , black eyes ."
"he shoved his hands into his pockets , his shoulders losing some of his anger ."
"`` i thought you 'd left me . ''"
"dharr 's words snapped her eyes back to his but she could n't see what was going on inside his head ."
"did his comment mean he would have been disappointed if she 'd left ?"
"no !"
"she had gotten her hopes up that he might feel something sincere for her twice and both times , she 'd been burned , badly ."
"she would n't go down that path again ."
"it hurt too much when her hopes were dashed cruelly under his unfeeling manners ."
"`` i wo n't leave until the children transfer their trust to you , '' she said and walked away ."
"victoria headed back to her room and noticed that her clothes were all put away as was her suitcase ."
"her bed was made as well and all evidence of the previous night was gone ."
"victoria sat down on her bed and put her head in her hands ."
"dharr did n't trust her ."
"she hated him ."
"she had to avoid him at all costs and still get out of here with her heart and her pride intact ."
"but how was she going to do that ?"
"sighing , she knew the answer ."
"avoid him at all costs ."
"moving out of her suite , she wandered the halls , asking a servant to convey the message that she would be absent for dinner tonight ."
"the servant asked if a meal should be brought to her suite but she shook her head , smiling and thanking her but moving off in a direction of the palace she 'd never seen before ."
"an hour later , victoria found a wonderful area ."
"it was a music room ."
"or more appropriately , a dance room ."
"there was a seventies style dance floor complete with lights under a clear plexiglas floor , a disco ball and a huge variety of songs ."
"she fiddled with the stereo system and was impressed when the sound came from several different speakers ."
"the lights came on with another flick of some buttons and suddenly , victoria was standing in the middle of a dance floor with soft jazz coming through speakers from all different sides of the room ."
"stepping into the middle , she closed her eyes and swayed to the beat , letting all her tension from the previous night and all the hurt from this morning melt away ."
"each time a thought of dharr came into her mind , she pushed it away and forced her mind to think about something else ."
"but the very effort to push his thoughts away kept them coming ."
"eventually , she knew she could no longer ignore the way he 'd made her feel last night ."
"if only the morning had n't come so soon ."
"if only she could have slept in his arms and woken up to feel his body under her head , to hear his heartbeat in her ear ."
"she knew that was the way she 'd fallen asleep ."
"what had gone wrong ?"
"she shuddered at the memory of his kiss , of his touch ."
"despite her anger , her body wanted to feel him again , right now ."
"she swung around and continued dancing , hoping she could hide in this room forever ."
"or at least until late at night when she could sneak back to her room ."
"she did n't dare go back to her own room ."
"dharr was furious enough with her to seek her out ."
"and what insults would he throw her way this time ?"
"she did n't want to find out ."
"she needed to protect her heart and her pride ."
"and she needed to find a way to fall out of love with the man ."
"she was swaying and singing , feeling the beat through her bones as the bass thumped out the beat ."
"her eyes were closed but she could see the lights from the ceiling through her eyelids and she just gloried in the feel of the music and being alone ."
"suddenly , she felt strong arms encircle her waist ."
"she tensed instantly , even though she knew it was n't a stranger ."
"it was dharr ."
"she 'd know his scent anywhere ."
"his arms were tender as they reached around , his head bending down to kiss her neck , her ear ."
"victoria wanted to pull away but his mouth made her knees give out and she found herself leaning against him , her back touching his chest , her head falling back to lay against his hard shoulder , giving him greater access to her neck ."
"`` dharr , '' she whispered ."
"`` what are you doing in here ? ''"
"he asked , his voice husky as his hands slipped along her stomach , resting just under her breasts ."
"`` hiding from you . ''"
"she shivered when his hands moved slightly , her breasts already aching to feel his hands caress them ."
"she could feel them swelling , her nipples hardening in anticipation ."
"`` why are you hiding from me ? ''"
"he asked , his hand moving higher and he heard her sigh ."
"the sound filled his senses and cooled his riled temper ."
"he 'd been searching for her for over an hour ."
"when he 'd heard the music coming from this area of the palace , he felt the tension drain away , to be replaced by the sexual need he felt whenever he was close to her ."
"`` because i did n't want you to hurt me anymore , '' she said ."
"but her body could n't move away from his ."
"dharr heard the words and closed his eyes ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i did n't realize i 'd hurt you so much last night ."
"it was never my intention . ''"
"victoria found the strength and swung around ."
"he would n't let her move away but at least she was facing him now ."
"`` you did n't hurt me last night , '' she said and felt the tears and anger well up inside ."
"`` you hurt me this morning . ''"
"dharr saw the pain and moved his hand up from her waist to her cheek , cradling her face with his ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he said a moment before his mouth touched hers ."
"he felt her shudder and knew that it was n't because of his kiss this time ."
"and he wrapped his arms around her , holding her close as he kissed her to ease her pain , trying to eliminate the hurt he 'd caused her by his confused reaction to their night together ."
"when he felt her resistance move away , he showed her in the only way he knew how that he was sorry ."
"he lifted her up and carried her back to his suite , ignoring the music and lights that were still on in the music room ."
"he did n't stop until he shouldered the door to his bedroom closed behind him ."
"then he let her legs slip down his body but would n't allow her to move away ."
"he stripped off her clothes right there , worshiping her body and kissing her everywhere ."
"his mouth moved to her breasts , capturing the peak in his mouth , pulling , nuzzling , sucking until she cried out , then he moved to the other , applying the same attention and hearing her surrender ."
"he could smell her arousal and it excited him as nothing else ever had ."
"reaching down , his hand covered her , moving inside , encouraging her to open for him ."
"his moth moved lower , kissing her stomach before he kneeled in front of her , his tongue moving to cover where his hand had been ."
"it was like ambrosia when he felt her tighten , then her first release was upon her and she melted down , shaking in his arms as he carried her to his bed ."
"she opened her eyes and saw that he was still dressed and her eyes widened in shock ."
"`` do n't , '' he said , thinking of the time five years ago when he 'd brought her to her first climax and then left her ."
"he quickly pulled off his clothes , then came down beside her ."
"`` i want you now , '' he said , and moved between her legs ."
"he was thrilled when she opened for him again , welcoming him with her legs , her arms and her body as his slid into hers ."
"dharr closed his eyes , the ecstasy of his entry almost too much for him to control ."
"she was so tight , so slick and hot he wanted to come inside her immediately ."
"but he held back , gaining control of his rampaging desires so he could help her find her release once more ."
"within moments , she was crying out , dharr felt her shivers start and that brought him over the edge as well ."
"he bent down and took her cries in his mouth , kissing her as they crashed together ."
"as their breathing came back to normal , dharr pulled her close , holding her against his shoulder as his hands tangled in her hair ."
"`` are you okay ? ''"
"he asked , wondering what she was thinking ."
"she 'd stilled a moment ago and he was worried about what she was thinking about ."
"`` yes , thank you . ''"
"she felt dharr 's chest rumble as he laughed at her response ."
"`` i 'm glad , '' he replied ."
"then he turned serious ."
"rolling her back , he looked down into her troubled green eyes ."
"`` i 'm sorry about this morning . ''"
"`` thank you . ''"
"dharr rolled his eyes at her polite response ."
"`` victoria , if you do n't stop being so polite , i 'm going to make love to you just to make sure you 're the woman i was holding in my arms a few minutes ago . ''"
"victoria blushed but looked away ."
"`` what would you like me to say ? ''"
"she asked ."
"she was terrified of what he was going to say or do next ."
"the past two sexual encounters with him had left her wounded ."
"she was n't sure she could survive another blow from him ."
"not right now anyway ."
"maybe once she 'd recovered from the tender care he 'd just shown her , she would be able to handle it ."
"`` i just need a little time to find my balance , '' she finally said , knowing that he was waiting for her to say something else ."
"`` you do n't really leave much room for anything , do you ? ''"
"`` i try not to ."
"would you have it any other way ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria inhaled sharply as his hand moved from her waist to her thigh , then back up again ."
"she wiggled in his arms and blushed when he chuckled ."
"`` oh no ! ''"
"she said and pushed against his shoulders ."
"she knew it was a useless endeavor unless he permitted it ."
"but since he did , she rolled him onto his back , her hair cascading around his face as she looked down at him this time ."
"`` you 're not going to do that to me again , '' she said , smiling in excitement ."
"`` oh , yes , victoria ."
"i 'm going to do it again and again , '' he countered and since his hands were no longer needed to hold his weight off her , they were free to skim across her back ."
"`` oh ! ''"
"she gasped ."
"`` i love the way your body responds to my touch , '' he growled , running his hands over her shoulders and arms , then back down her back ."
"`` does yours ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` no , '' he responded but he smiled at the interest in her eyes ."
"`` are you sure ? ''"
"she asked , her tongue touching his skin , tasting the salt and enjoying his indrawn breath ."
"`` i think it is my turn , '' she said and bent to touch her mouth to his male nipple , loving the way his hands held her still ."
"but she had too much exploring to do and her head moved around ."
"her hands felt his muscles , touching him while her mouth continued its exploration ."
"as her mouth moved lower , she could feel his body tense ."
"feeling powerful and feminine , she moved lower , her mouth hovering over his manhood for a long moment before finally closing over him ."
"the harsh intake of breath she heard from him excited her and she continued , tentatively exploring and tasting , loving the velvet hardness of him ."
"long before she was satisfied , he pulled her up , bringing her mouth to his and kissing her while his hands settled her over him , having her straddle his hips ."
"`` you want power ? ''"
"victoria could only nod her head , feeling heady and so turned on she could barely think much less talk ."
"`` then take control , '' he said ."
"with a hand on each side of her hips , he slid inside her , watching her face as the surprise filtered in ."
"victoria moved her hips , then gasped in delight as feelings of intense pleasure seared through her body ."
"`` what do i do ? ''"
"she asked , moving again and loving the way it felt ."
"she continued to move in ways that caused pleasure , closing her eyes and letting the feelings course through her body ."
"`` anything , '' he rasped , lifting his hands to touch her breasts , then tangle in her hair , pulling her down to kiss her again ."
"`` anything you want , '' he said again ."
"victoria needed no further encouragement ."
"she moved , letting him slide in and out , enjoying the expression on his face as she did so ."
"after several minutes , he took her hips and controlled the pace , and within minutes , she was shivering , collapsing on top of his chest as her third orgasm ripped through her , leaving her helpless and languorous ."
"she had no idea that he 'd also found his release , just knowing that her body could n't move any more ."
"`` victoria ? ''"
"he asked , lifting her hair up so he could see her face ."
"victoria just put her hand over his mouth , moving her head so she could see him ."
"`` do n't speak , '' she said ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"he asked ."
"turning away so he could n't see her tears , she shook her head ."
"`` because each time we get to this point , you say something or do something nasty and then i 'll have to hate you again . ''"
"dharr was absolutely still for a moment ."
"`` and if i do n't say or do something nasty ?"
"how will you feel about me then ? ''"
"victoria started shivering ."
"it was the moment of truth and she was n't sure if she was up to it ."
"`` i do n't know ."
"i 'm still waiting to start hating you again . ''"
"dharr laughed softly ."
"`` would it help if you knew that i do n't want to make you hate me ? ''"
"he said ."
"pulling her hair off to one side , he let his fingers feel the softness ."
"`` in fact , i do n't think i 've been able to actually live without you for the past five years , '' he admitted ."
"victoria could feel his heart beat accelerate and turned to look at him ."
"`` why did you leave me like that ? ''"
"she asked , wishing she could stop the hurt in her voice but it was still too raw , especially after last night ."
"`` why did you say those things to me ? ''"
"dharr sighed and sat up , pulling her with him but not letting her move away ."
"he tucked the pillows behind his back and looked down at her lovely , pain filled eyes ."
"`` because i was jealous . ''"
"`` jealous ?"
"of what ?"
"or who ? ''"
"`` of scott ."
"that morning , i arrived in london early ."
"i came to see you and found scott leaving your dorm room , happily enjoying a sandwich and looking like he 'd just fallen out of bed ."
"i naturally assumed it had been yours . ''"
"victoria 's mouth dropped open and she looked up into his face ."
"the laughter started slowly but the more she thought about it , the harder she laughed ."
"dharr obviously did n't appreciate the humor but he did n't pull away ."
"in fact , he only waited until her laughter died away before raising one eyebrow in inquiry ."
"`` would you care to share the joke ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria nodded and smiled again , controlling the laughter , but just barely ."
"`` scott 's gay . ''"
"she watched the emotions cross his face , running the gamut of disbelief to shock to horror ."
"`` gay ? ''"
"he asked in a strangled voice ."
"`` gay , '' she confirmed ."
"`` in fact , at the time , he was dating a very nice man named marcus . ''"
"dharr leaned his head back against the silk covered headboard and closed his eyes ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he said , pulling her closer ."
"`` i 'm so sorry , '' he said again and buried his face in her neck ."
"victoria felt all the awful feelings just melt away and she wrapped her arms around his neck , feeling her heart melt with his apology ."
"`` but why did you ... . ''"
"she swallowed hard before she could continue , `` leave that nasty message this morning ? ''"
"`` i swear it was n't what you were thinking , '' he said , lifting his head and she could see the sincerity in his eyes ."
"`` it was a gift to show you how much last night meant to me ."
"i swear it was nothing more than that . ''"
"`` oh , dharr !"
"i 'm sorry , '' she said and pulled him close ."
"`` i knew i lo ... '' she stopped just in time ."
"just because he did n't think nasty , demeaning things , did n't mean he wanted her love ."
"the words were swallowed quickly and she looked up , trying to decide if she 'd goofed again ."
"his eyes sharpened on her shocked face and he moved closer , determined to find out what she had been about to say ."
"`` what were you going to say ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"`` that you love me ? ''"
"he asked ."
"victoria was going to deny it but she could tell that the dictator had come back ."
"she was n't going to get around it ."
"`` yes , '' she said sadly , looking up at the ceiling instead of his handsome face ."
"`` but i know you do n't want that right now . ''"
"she started to get out of bed , feeling foolish but he pulled her back , swinging her so she was laying flat against the now rumpled sheets , her hair flying out behind her and dharr towering over her ."
"`` say it , '' he demanded ."
"`` why , so you can laugh at me ? ''"
"she threw back at him ."
"his eyes softened and he shook his head gently ."
"`` no ."
"so i can tell you how much i love you ."
"how much i need you in my life and how i have suffered for five long years , thinking you were falling in love and marrying another man because i was too stupid to claim you for my own . ''"
"with each word , the pain surrounding victoria 's heart melted a little more ."
"`` you love me ? ''"
"she asked , her hands coming to touch his handsome face and her eyes filling up with hope ."
"`` yes ."
"now will you say it ? ''"
"he demanded again ."
"`` i love you ! ''"
"she cried out , throwing herself into his arms and bringing his face down to hers ."
"`` i love you , you arrogant man , '' she giggled ."
"`` and you 're going to marry me and give me lots of children and help me raise arina and bajan , '' he ordered , bending down to kiss her neck ."
"`` absolutely , '' she agreed ."
"epilogue dharr closed the file and nodded in the general direction of the men gathered around the table ."
"`` thank you for your input , gentlemen , '' he said , effectively ending the meeting ."
"dharr stood up and walked out ."
"as soon as he passed by his secretary 's desk , he raised an eyebrow in question ."
"`` in the kitchen your highness , '' the man said , bowing and closing his eyes although he wished he could look up and see the king 's expression ."
"it was almost comical to see his face when he realized his queen was doing something he disapproved of ."
"dharr sighed heavily and shook his head ."
"he walked down the now familiar hallway , reaching the kitchen in short time ."
"he stopped in the doorway , watching the scene in front of him ."
"the chefs were off to one side , busily preparing food for the evening meal ."
"but in one corner , in an area specially created for small beings to cook with low tables and smaller measuring cups , tiny refrigerators and safety blenders , sat his brother 's children as well as his two year old son ."
"the three of them were staring into a bowl surrounded by a table covered in flour and something he suspected was chocolate but he could never be sure ."
"then his eyes moved higher to watch his beautiful , hugely pregnant wife waddle out of the storeroom ."
"she was due to deliver their daughter any day now but still she somehow got her body down to the level of the small table ."
"`` here you go , '' she was saying ."
"victoria handed the milk to bajan since it was obviously his turn to put the ingredient into the bowl ."
"`` daddy ! ''"
"his son david said and got up out of his chair to throw himself into his father 's arms ."
"bajan was next and then arina who pushed her body between the more aggressive boys to reach dharr ."
"he hugged all of them , then let them lead him over to their cooking table ."
"`` what are you making today ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` we 're learning about fractions , '' bajan said importantly ."
"`` ah , fractions , eh ? ''"
"he said and dipped his finger into the cookie dough ."
"it was pretty good ."
"`` i wish i could have learned about fractions like this , '' he said ."
"`` you 're deprived , '' victoria said , rolling her eyes ."
"`` no , i 'm in love , '' he replied and pulled her into his arms effortlessly , despite her extra pounds ."
"`` so am i , '' she replied , willingly moving into his arms and kissing him back ."
"chapter 1 `` no , jacob , you ca n't eat sam 's fruit ."
"it does n't count even if you are twins . ''"
"glancing at her watch , siri michaels realized they were again running behind on their morning schedule ."
"as she put the milk back in the refrigerator , she caught a suspicious movement out of the corner of her eye ."
"`` sam , you ca n't hide your fruit in your pockets ."
"you did that last week and forgot about them ."
"i found them when i was doing the laundry and it was disgusting . ''"
"she almost rolled her eyes when her twin three year old boys laughed delightedly at rotting fruit in their jeans pockets ."
"were all boys fascinated by anything disgusting ?"
"or were hers just abnormally enthralled ?"
"`` come on guys ."
"we need to hurry up ."
"just finish your milk and gobble up those apples . ''"
"she shoved the files she 'd been working on the previous night into her computer bag and looked around , stepping over legos and narrowly missing a toy fire truck ."
"thankfully , she was still in her slippers because if she 'd changed into her heels for the work day , she 'd have been a gonner ."
"in the midst of making a path , she remembered one very important question ."
"`` sam , did you put on underwear today ? ''"
"why she even had to ask was beyond her but the tike liked going as free as a bird ."
"she was n't looking at him but since there was no response , she glanced back and found two dark , curly heads bent close ."
"as much as she loved these little guys , that pose was never good ."
"and she 'd learned the hard way that silence was bad ."
"generally , very bad ."
"`` sam , '' she called out from three feet away and waited until she had his full attention ."
"when he looked up , the guilt in his eyes told her she 'd caught them doing something wrong , but the trick was figuring out what that `` something '' might be ."
"had it already occurred ?"
"or was their mischief imminent ?"
"she had to maintain a straight face under these circumstances , otherwise , they would consider her humor as encouragement in whatever they had planned ."
"`` sam , do you have underwear on ? ''"
"she asked again ."
"she could n't help it when the chuckle escaped as he looked down and pulled his pants away to check ."
"how could he not know ?"
"it seemed to her like underwear was an essential piece of clothing and the absence of that piece would be bothersome and uncomfortable ."
"siri knew the answer to her question when he looked up with that devilish grin ."
"`` go put some on , '' she commanded ."
"the little guy scrambled off his chair before racing full speed to the bedroom and siri was grateful that he was still at an age when he would obey her ."
"she could n't take a break to ponder the future at this point in the morning ."
"with sam out of the picture , that left jacob alone ."
"together , the twins were as thick as thieves ."
"separate them though , and she could usually get one to confess ."
"`` what are you guys planning ? ''"
"she asked , bending down so she was at eye level with jacob ."
"they were fraternal twins , but they looked so similar it was extremely difficult for strangers to tell them apart ."
"siri could because she knew them and loved every tiny freckle on their faces ."
"`` we 're not planning anything , '' jacob whispered , and he placed a chubby hand on both sides of her face ."
"`` i promise , momma ."
"we 're innocent . ''"
"siri knew she was in trouble then ."
"`` jacob , if you let me in on the secret , maybe we can have ice cream for dessert tonight . ''"
"jacob 's eyes widened and he smiled excitedly , showing his tiny white toddler teeth with gaps in between because not all of his teeth were in ."
"`` momma , sam has a surprise for you . ''"
"siri 's stomach churned with those words ."
"the last time sam brought her a surprise , he was covered in mud and had two little kittens under each arm ."
"he 'd `` rescued '' the kittens from someone else 's backyard ."
"how he 'd done that , she had no idea since her back yard was fenced in with a gate that only an adult could handle and there were n't any kittens , much less mud , in her backyard ."
"it had taken a week and several lost kitten posters posted around the neighborhood before the original owners had been found and kittens returned ."
"`` jacob , you know i love surprises , '' she lied and felt no remorse , `` but i also know that sometimes sam 's surprises can be a bit scary ."
"can you give me a hint ? ''"
"jacob was torn because he did n't want his mother to be scared , but he could n't reveal the amazing surprise ."
"`` this wo n't scare you ."
"i promise ."
"it 's a good surprise . ''"
"sam was coming back down the hallway by that point so there was n't anything else siri could say to convince him at the moment ."
"but she 'd have to work on him a bit later , her stomach churning at the idea of whatever these two extremely intelligent children had devised ."
"`` okay , do n't tell him i know there 's going to be a surprise , okay ? ''"
"it would make it easier to work on jacob if sam did n't reinforce the `` surprise '' aspect of the treat they were creating for her ."
"at least she hoped it was for her ."
"the idea of her boys devising something for someone else , where she was n't able to run interference , was n't a scenario she relished ."
"jacob nodded happily , then jumped down off his chair himself and caught up with his brother ."
"she cringed when she saw their heads immediately bend towards each other ."
"`` get your shoes and coats on , '' she called out and looked at the news on her computer screen , surveying the headlines on the chicago tribune website ."
"elections coming , check ."
"jobs report getting better , check ."
"weather , rainy ."
"not check , not good . ''"
"put on your rain coats , '' she called out again ."
"oil prices down , for how long ?"
"she started to put her computer to sleep , but something caught her eye ."
"oil prices down because ... .no !"
"that simply was n't possible !"
"in her panic , she could n't even ensure that the boys were following her instructions ."
"her eyes skimmed the text , then re-read the first paragraph over again since her panic was diminishing her ability to absorb what the words were explaining ."
"he 's divorcing ?"
"she sat down heavily in the kitchen chair and clicked on the screen to get the full article ."
"as she read through the words , only the message that sheik malik bin saqqaf was in the midst of a divorce and pressure was mounting for him to re-marry quickly in order to produce an heir , something that had n't happened in his first marriage and his advisors were becoming worried about an end to the dynasty ."
"a dynasty that had been extremely good for duban ."
"why was a divorce necessary ?"
"why was n't he just marrying another woman , she wondered ?"
"could n't he have several wives ?"
"the idea actually made her stomach ache so she slapped the computer shut and turned around , only to find several sets of eyes staring at her ."
"sam and jacob were in their rain coats and shoes , although sam had his shoes on the wrong feet ."
"to the left of sam were their two dogs , `` rover '' and `` boy '' , neither canine having a very celebrated parentage and to the right of jacob was `` kitty '' , a white , short haired feline that loved shedding on siri 's black slacks ."
"all three animals had not been her choice but had shown up at various stages in her sons ' short lives and become part of the family ."
"sam was the animal lover and any creature that crossed his path needed to be adopted and `` loved '' by her adorable little son ."
"he brought home animals even when they had owners , and she had to return them , sometimes with a very sad boy on her hands because , in his mind , no one could take care of animals and give them enough love like he could ."
"`` what 's wrong , momma ? ''"
"sam asked , his hand holding rover 's scraggly fur nervously ."
"jacob , sensing the same tension , leaned into sam and both boys somehow figured out how to have as much of their bodies touching each other without lying on top of the other ."
"they did n't need to be concerned with her trauma , she told herself ."
"all they needed in their lives right now was a secure home with lots of hugs , kisses , understanding and parameters ."
"`` nothing is wrong , little guys , '' she said and pasted a bright smile on her face ."
"`` i just remembered that i needed to stop and get gas but i can do that after i drop you two off at school ."
"i know you have your big day today , do n't you ? ''"
"the boys relaxed slightly , but they kept close , not sure if they believed their mother or not ."
"`` let 's go , '' she said and herded the boys out to the car , kept the animals in the house with one foot while she closed and locked the door , all the while balancing their school bags on one shoulder , her computer bag in the other , her keys in her right hand and her coffee in the left ."
"she refused to let her mind think about that man and his divorce as well as all the painful memories that were long gone and should never to be thought of again ."
"as she drove them the short distance to their preschool , she did her best to appear upbeat and unconcerned until she kissed each of them on their chubby cheeks moments before they each ran off to play with their friends ."
"she watched them carefully for a few moments , noting that each other was their real best friend ."
"the others in the play group were interesting , but sam and jacob were two halves of a whole ."
"when they were in elementary school , she 'd have to separate them , encourage them to open up to others and diversify their lives , but for now , they were doing well ."
"they were so smart it scared her sometimes ."
"would she be able to give them everything they needed as they grew up ?"
"was she a good mother ?"
"was she doing everything right ?"
"she sighed as she exited the school , her mid whirling with questions and insecurities ."
"how nice it would be if she could talk to someone , bounce her ideas off of them and have someone take a bit of the worry away ."
"but she did n't have that ."
"she was a single mother of twin boys who were always running around , always chasing something , curious about anything that moved , and if it did n't move , they wanted to know why ."
"if she was n't working to support them , she was searching the internet to keep up with their questions ."
"but no matter how exhausting it was , she loved them and knew she 'd never give them up for anything or anyone ."
"even a man who needed an heir , she thought angrily ."
"he 'd walked out , he 'd rejected her letter , he 'd never called or checked in on her ."
"he could just go on about his merry old way and raise oil prices or let them fall , whatever made his day ."
"he 'd never find out about her sons !"
"she 'd tried to let him know about their existence but he 'd rejected that letter , had n't even opened the letter since it was `` returned to sender '' ."
"at the warehouse , she went to her office , smiling at the employees who were already on duty , chatting with several of them about deliveries and inventories , before moving on to her office ."
"once there , she closed her door , something she rarely did , and sat down in her chair to try and figure out what to do ."
"she had to think through this latest news carefully , put it into perspective and then move on with her life ."
"malik 's marriage or dissolution of his marriage had no bearing on her life ."
"she was independent , she 'd worked hard to build up her toy business and she had two wonderful boys that depended on her ."
"the days were always chaotic and she worked hard , proud of the company she 'd built up four years ago ."
"she 'd built up this toy company from nothing , just an idea to distribute educational toys for kids , working hard over the years to ensure its success ."
"there were several people who had n't liked working for someone younger , but she 'd quickly changed their minds as she 'd grown the company , expanding and giving all of them more opportunities ."
"the idea for her company had come to her almost immediately after she 'd discovered she was pregnant ."
"she and her mother had been searching for toys that would be appropriate for what she 'd thought would be her only child ."
"what they 'd been able to find had been some great toys , some bad ones and some mediocre , but nothing all in one spot ."
"after a great deal of trial and error , she 'd created a web site that consolidated all of the toys she thought were educational and beneficial to kids at various stages of their lives ."
"the web site had taken off and she 'd quickly expanded from her parents ' dining room to a small store , and then to this warehouse that could hold a larger inventory so she could get the toys out to her customers more quickly as well as several other retail stores ."
"at lunch , her assistant placed a sandwich beside her elbow and siri smiled her thanks ."
"`` would you close the door again , jane ? ''"
"she asked as the woman was walking out ."
"jane was startled at the unprecedented request but complied and , as soon as she was alone , siri put her head in her hands , closing her eyes and trying to push the memories at bay ."
"she did n't want to think about him but that article this morning had really gotten to her ."
"she looked out her window at the drizzle that continued to fall , her mind traveling back to those halcyon days when everything was rosy and beautiful ."
"and she had n't known the pain of a man 's betrayal ."
"chapter 2 four years ago siri glanced once more at her date for the night , wondering what in the world she possibly could have seen in him ."
"she was in her second year of university and he was in his last so when he 'd asked if she could accompany him on a dinner with his new boss , she 'd eagerly accepted , thinking it would be nice to spend some time with people who might be intellectually stimulating ."
"not to mention gary was a very handsome man ."
"she would n't mind getting to know him better , and maybe something could grow ."
"they 'd spent some time together at coffee shops and study groups although she 'd been too intimidated by everyone else to speak up much ."
"as she listened to him now , she could n't believe how stupid he was ."
"if he mis-quoted one more philosopher , she might have to say something ."
"looking at their dinner companions , gary 's new boss and his extremely patient wife , she was n't sure if they were just bored out of their minds by gary 's monologue on why he 'd adopted various aspects of some philosophers ' doctrines , discarding other parts as `` superfluous '' or `` redundant '' ."
"or if they were thinking of something else just to keep their minds off of what gary was saying ."
"when he once again ascribed aristotle to the introduction of forms to philosophy instead of plato , siri looked away , unwilling to see if their dinner companions , and gary 's future employer , agreed or were showing contempt at the man 's blatant abuse of the great philosophers ."
"as she glanced to her right , her eyes collided with a pair of dark , amused ones ."
"the man was exceptionally handsome with dark , wavy hair and a strong jaw , and a half smiling mouth that showed he too had overheard gary 's comments ."
"this man , whoever he was , understood the differences between plato and aristotle and was n't impressed with siri 's dinner companion ."
"siri glanced away , feeling somewhat odd with that man 's gaze ."
"she placed a hand over her fluttery stomach and picked up her ice water , taking a long draw to cool herself down ."
"trying hard to focus on the conversation , hoping she might be able to liven it up a bit , she waited for a break in gary 's diatribe about durkheim ."
"how had they gone from philosophy to sociology ?"
"she really must have missed a great deal of the conversation ."
"their food arrived and she picked up her fork , hoping gary would also take the hint and start eating ."
"his boss appeared to be moving out of the bored range and into the irritated ."
"`` gary , that looks delicious ."
"what did you order ? ''"
"she asked , only to be polite ."
"it did n't work and gary shifted back to philosophy after declaring emphatically that agnostics , like he claimed to be , should n't limit their world after rejecting the existence of a divine being ."
"siri actually choked on her water with that one and her eyes went once more to the man at the next table ."
"sure enough , he was looking right back at her with an eyebrow raised in question ."
"she tried very hard to smother the amusement at gary 's confusion with agnostics versus atheists , but she kept quiet and just prayed to the divine being that she sincerely believed in , that this dinner would end quickly and their dinner companions were unaware of gary 's gaffes ."
"when the meal was finally over , gary 's exuberance over his performance was astounding ."
"the four of them were walking out of the restaurant and siri pulled her wrap closer around her ."
"it was n't that it was chilly so much as she did n't want gary to touch her bare skin ."
"she was so repulsed by his ignorance that she could n't deal with any kind of affection from him ."
"she turned to the side and once again , she found herself caught up in the stranger 's gaze ."
"he was surrounded by his dinner companions , but he was n't paying any attention to them , just as she was in an island that seemed to contain only herself and the man standing ten feet away ."
"he was much taller than she 'd originally have guessed and in the brighter light of the valet area , she could see that his eyes were genuinely a light grey and were n't a factor from the dim lighting of the restaurant ."
"he was handsome , in an off-hand kind of way ."
"it was n't so much his looks though , but something that was alluring about his appearance , something that drew one 's eyes towards him ."
"he would n't release her eyes and she felt captured , unable to look away , unable to hear anything that was going on around her and she was n't sure if she was standing or sitting , just too transfixed to do anything other than stand there until he released her ."
"fortunately , she did n't really mind the hold he had over her ."
"this stranger 's gaze was much more enjoyable than anything that was going on around her ."
"until gary realized that she was n't paying attention to him ."
"he grabbed her arm and nudged her ."
"`` are you okay ? ''"
"he asked in an almost angry tone ."
"siri blinked and that seemed to break the magic ."
"she looked away , noticed where she was , that three pairs of eyes were waiting on her expectantly ."
"`` i 'm sorry , i dazed out for a moment ."
"did someone ask me a question ? ''"
"gary puffed up like some angry cave man ."
"`` i asked if you knew that man over there . ''"
"siri glanced back , but the tall man was getting into a large , black sport utility vehicle , disappearing from her sight ."
"`` no ."
"i 've never met him before , '' she replied honestly ."
"`` he was sitting at the table next to ours during dinner . ''"
"`` then why were you staring at him like that ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"siri glanced away , feeling slightly guilty ."
"`` i apologize ."
"he was just ... . ''"
"she shook her head , unable to explain what had gone on between herself and the stranger ."
"she could n't explain it in her mind , so putting words to her feelings and reactions was n't really possible ."
"gary cursed under his breath and turned back to his future boss ."
"`` i 'm sorry , mr. meyers ."
"siri is n't usually this rude ."
"i suppose i simply made the wrong choice in companions for the evening . ''"
"siri looked at the man who had been boring her all evening , her mouth falling open in astonishment ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"`` you heard me , '' gary replied , shaking his head in disdain ."
"`` you 're rude and inconsiderate and i do n't think we 're going to work out well together . ''"
"siri laughed and took a step back ."
"turning to the other couple , she smiled brightly ."
"`` mr. meyers , ms. meyers , i appreciate the dinner tonight ."
"the food was exceptionally good ."
"unfortunately , the man you are considering hiring does n't know the difference between plato , who 's primary doctrine was about forms and their abstract meaning , to put a great mind in a nutshell , '' she said turning to glare at gary , `` and aristotle , who was a student of plato ."
"and how on earth you thought durkheim was a companion of socrates is beyond me , since the man was born in france several centuries after socrates died , over thirteen hundred miles from athens , greece ."
"not only that , durkheim studied sociology . ''"
"she was just about to turn away when she thought of one other subject ."
"`` oh , and one other stupid comment ?"
"atheists do n't believe in a divine being ."
"agnostics accept the existence of a divine being is unknown ."
"a subtle difference , but one your mind is too small to understand . ''"
"she turned to the other couple , surprised to see their amusement at her comments ."
"`` well said , '' mr. meyers replied , the first time he revealed that he was fully aware of all the unintelligent comments gary had mouthed during the dinner ."
"`` please give me a call when you 're ready for a job ."
"i 'd like to talk to you about possibilities , '' he said , handing her his business card ."
"looking back at gary , `` i do n't think that position we discussed is going to work out after all ."
"and please do n't blame this young lady ."
"i was going to tell you this in the morning , but since you pushed the envelope by speaking to her so poorly a few moments ago , i decided it was pointless to pull my punches since you set the tone . ''"
"ms. meyers was already nodding and tucking her hand into her husband 's elbow ."
"`` would you like a ride back to your apartment , siri ?"
"i 'm not sure i 'm comfortable with you going back with this young man . ''"
"siri glanced up at gary and stepped back ."
"`` thank you ."
"that 's very considerate of you . ''"
"she thought about catching a cab back to her place , but gary was red enough in the face to be a problem so it was probably better to get out of the area ."
"besides , she did n't really have the funds for a cab ride ."
"the dress had cost her a great deal , not to mention the shoes that were biting into the tender flesh of her feet ."
"the valet arrived at that moment , handing keys to both gary and mr. meyers ."
"siri followed the couple , slipping into their back seat and refusing to glance at gary the whole time ."
"she was relieved when the older couple pulled away from the curb , both of them chatting away at some of gary 's more idiotic comments during the meal ."
"the next day , siri was in her tiny apartment that she shared with another student ."
"both of them were studying , relaxed on the battered sofa and chair that made up their den area ."
"both pieces of furniture had seen better days but were covered with blankets or sheets that hid the worst of their wear ."
"siri had gone to her two classes for the day already and was propped up on the chair with her legs hanging over the side , her brown , slightly curly hair piled on top of her head , held there with a couple of pencils and a pen ."
"she had a highlighter in one hand and was flipping the pages of her art history book , making notes in the margins with the pen and highlighting anything that might be pertinent in the text ."
"when the doorbell rang , her roommate , linda , jumped up and answered the door , dumping her calculus book onto the floor eagerly ."
"`` expecting someone ?"
"maybe an agitated , unemployed idiot perhaps ? ''"
"she joked , referring to gary ."
"siri had told her all about the meal as soon as she 'd gotten home last night , both of them laughing at some of gary 's comments ."
"`` not for me , '' siri said , focusing on the history of renaissance paintings ."
"in the back of her mind , siri heard linda answer the door , but the mumbled greetings did n't break her concentration ."
"`` uh , siri ? ''"
"linda called out ."
"`` tell them i 'm not here , '' she called back , knowing that whoever it was could hear her comments but still hoping they would be discouraged ."
"`` um ... i 'm not sure this guy is going to take no for an answer . ''"
"that got through to siri and she glanced up from her book ."
"when she saw the tall man in the dark suit standing in her kitchen , the only other area besides the den and the two bedrooms which were on opposite sides of the den , siri jumped up , dumping her books and notes all over the orange , shag carpet ."
"`` oh ! ''"
"she cried out and looked down at the papers , then back up at the gorgeous man who was looking at her with a blank expression on his face ."
"he looked scarier , more intimidating , in the bright afternoon sunshine ."
"and much , much taller !"
"she pulled the pen out of her hair , wishing she 'd pulled on something better than leggings and an old tee shirt which had definitely seen better days and only came down to her waist ."
"`` sorry , '' she said and grabbed linda 's boyfriend 's shirt which was draped over the back of the only other chair in the apartment ."
"`` i was n't expecting anyone today ."
"we were just studying . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry to interrupt , '' the man replied with a slight accent which siri could n't place immediately ."
"`` i thought perhaps we might be formally introduced since we had such an amusing evening last night . ''"
"siri had to laugh despite her nervousness at this extremely large man in her apartment ."
"`` it was n't so funny towards the end , but he did serve as a good amusement factor , did n't he ? ''"
"malik took a step forward , his eyes looking over her beautiful skin for signs of abuse ."
"`` he did n't hurt you , did he ?"
"i know that you confronted him at the end , and i apologize for not being there to stop him if things became physical . ''"
"she looked up at him curiously ."
"`` it was n't your responsibility to ensure my safety , but i appreciate the thought ."
"i can take care of myself , '' she claimed ."
"malik stopped his laughter , but only just in time ."
"this woman who barely reached his shoulder thought she could handle an angry man with his pride wounded in front of his future employer ?"
"`` i 'm glad to hear it . ''"
"he stepped back and smiled ."
"`` i would like to take you out to dinner myself , if you have the time . ''"
"siri was startled and not sure how to respond ."
"she looked to linda who was just as awestruck ."
"regrouping quickly so she did n't appear so ridiculous , she replied , `` i 'm flattered , but i really do n't think that i 'm i your league , '' she stated softly , wishing that she could be in his league ."
"this man was hunk material , but also terrifying for some reason ."
"linda really did n't like siri 's response and stepped forward ."
"`` she 'd be delighted , '' she contradicted ."
"`` what time and where should she meet you ? ''"
"she asked , already picking up a pen and notebook and writing something down on it ."
"malik glanced at the cute redhead who interceded on his behalf , appreciating her efforts ."
"`` eight o'clock , tomorrow night ?"
"i 'll pick you up here . ''"
"linda nodded , ignoring siri 's attempt to contradict her ."
"`` that sounds perfect , `` she said , nodding her head for emphasis ."
"`` here 's siri 's cell phone number in case anything comes up ."
"and she 'll be ready tomorrow at eight . ''"
"the tall , gorgeous man took the paper and bowed slightly , handing the paper to one of the large , bulky men behind him without even glancing at it ."
"`` i look forward to our evening ."
"and i will work hard to ensure that i do n't mistake my philosophers since you apparently are so well versed in their doctrines . ''"
"with that , he stepped out of the apartment and closed the door , leaving behind two stunned women who looked at each other as if they 'd just been invited to a royal ball ."
"`` who was that man ? ''"
"linda asked , when she remembered to close her mouth , her whole body showing her excitement for siri 's new man ."
"siri shrugged , still staring at the now closed door ."
"`` i have no idea ."
"he was at the table next to ours last night and we looked at each other every time gary said something stupid but i do n't know his name ."
"and i could n't even guess where he 's from since i could n't place his accent . ''"
"linda was n't excited any longer ."
"she was actually looking a bit worried now ."
"`` and you 're going out with him ?"
"is that safe ? ''"
"siri turned to glare at her roommate , astonished that she was asking that question now after linda had just accepted the date despite siri 's rejection ."
"`` not really , '' she said with emphasis , raising an eyebrow ."
"`` but did i have a choice ?"
"not really ! ''"
"linda laughed and flopped back down on the sofa , her worry dissipating just as easily as it had appeared ."
"`` well , it 's about time you got out and explored a little ."
"have a bit of adventure tomorrow night with your mystery guy ."
"he looks yummy , so enjoy it ! ''"
"`` i might enjoy it more if i knew his name . ''"
"at that moment , her cell phone rang and she looked down at the tiny screen ."
"it was an unknown number , but something told her to answer the call anyway ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"she answered warily ."
"`` i think i forgot to tell you my name , '' a deep voice said over the phone ."
"`` yes , we were just mentioning that , '' she replied , glancing at linda who was watching her eagerly ."
"`` i 'm malik , '' he explained ."
"`` and i 'm very glad to meet you , siri . ''"
"she hesitated to ask , actually afraid of the answer but knowing she had to find out anyway ."
"`` how did you find out who i am ? ''"
"`` i have a few resources . ''"
"`` and how do you know where i live ? ''"
"`` same resources ."
"i promise i 'm not a stalker ."
"just consider me a man interested in getting to know a beautiful woman ."
"i 'll see you tomorrow night . ''"
"siri glanced at her phone , then at linda ."
"`` his name is malik and he has 'resources ' , '' she explained to her curious roommate ."
"`` he has a lot more than resources , '' linda replied with a grin before once more diving back into her books ."
"siri tried as well to refocus on her art history but after that phone conversation , she had trouble concentrating ."
"her mind kept drifting back to the moment when malik had walked into her apartment , how large he was and trying to figure out what kinds of 'resources ' he could bring forth that would provide him with a stranger 's name and address so quickly ."
"she considered calling him back and canceling since anyone with resources like that might use them for good or bad ."
"she was n't someone who could fight anyone that powerful or wealthy ."
"but in the end , she did n't make the call and her worry changed from trying to figure out who he was to what she was going to wear on a date with someone so sophisticated ."
"besides , she was also curious and rejecting the dinner date would n't give her the answers she now craved as to his identity ."
"the following night , she dressed in a pretty sundress with bright yellow flowers all over the skirt and a yellow cardigan ."
"spring was on the way and she felt daring , but also wanted to be a little conservative ."
"the man was definitely too confident , she thought and this dress screamed out `` interested '' but `` not jumping into bed with you '' ."
"when the doorbell rang , her fingers were shaking and she glanced back to linda who was sitting o the ratty old sofa with her friends eating a pizza before they all settled down for a long night of studying ."
"at least that 's what they said they were doing ."
"siri suspected that they were all anticipating getting a good look at the guy who was taking siri out for dinner ."
"as she opened the door , she glanced at her friends , all of whom were actually leaning forward , pizza forgotten , in order to get a better look at the man who was picking her up ."
"with a bright smile , she opened the door , then stepped out , closing it behind her and surprising malik who was standing at her doorway ."
"`` do n't ask , '' she said to his questioning look as she dropped her phone and keys into her purse ."
"`` it 's better just to walk away . ''"
"she felt mischievous in not allowing her friends to see the man they 'd all congregated in her apartment to see ."
"he chuckled , then took a step back ."
"`` i 'll take your word on it . ''"
"he put a hand to the small of her back and led her down the stairs ."
"outside , a long limousine was waiting and siri almost stumbled as they approached ."
"she looked around , hoping no one recognized her ."
"she stepped quickly into the car and hoped the darkness would hide her from the crowds looking on from the other apartments , most of whom were rented by fellow students , and all of whom were curious to see who was being picked up by a man who could afford a limousine ."
"as soon as the door closed behind him , she turned to face him ."
"`` i appreciate the gesture , but the limousine really is n't necessary . ''"
"malik smothered a laugh and refrained from telling her that the limousine was not only necessary , but mandated by his body guards ."
"the car was n't just bullet proof , it was also bomb proof and loaded with enough power to transfer him out of any danger that might come up ."
"`` it might not be necessary in your mind , but believe me , it 's more than necessary in mine . ''"
"siri was charmed by his old fashioned manners and she loved talking with him ."
"she had no idea what she ate that night , or any other night after that since conversing with malik was better than talking with any of her companions ."
"they debated philosophy , art , history , politics and any number of subjects ."
"they had dinner together the next three nights but he had to go out of town for the weekend so she did n't get to see him for several days ."
"she was painfully disappointed , not just because she loved arguing with him and laughing with him , but also because she was always so excited to see him ."
"and she definitely loved the way he touched her ."
"at the end of each night , he took her into his arms and kissed her until she was shivering with need ."
"the first night , he kissed her at her door ."
"the second night , he took her into his arms as soon as he picked her up , pressing her back against the wall outside of her apartment and kissing her until someone walked by ."
"he tried to take her into his arms in the back seat of the suv , but siri was too shy with the man driving in the front and pulled back ."
"malik accepted her reticence with an amused expression , but when he dropped her off , he pulled her into his arms as soon as they were back at her apartment door ."
"`` invite me inside , siri , '' he said before moving to her neck and nibbling his way down to her collar bone ."
"siri sighed and shook her head , enjoying the way his lips tickled and excited at the same time ."
"`` linda is probably inside with her boyfriend ."
"we would n't have any privacy , '' she sighed , then gasped when his hand moved up to cover her breast ."
"her hand automatically went up to his wrist , trying to stop him , but when his thumb found her already hard nipple , she groaned and pressed his hand closer ."
"after several more minutes of this torment , he pulled back and looked down at her ."
"`` tomorrow night , we 're dining al fresco , '' he said with a husky tone ."
"`` sounds lovely , '' she said , ignoring the fact that he was just assuming she 'd agree to dinner with him again ."
"`` what time ? ''"
"`` early ."
"i 'll pick you up at six . ''"
"siri should have said no , that she needed to study , but she did n't care about classes right now ."
"all she wanted was to be with malik , to laugh and listen to him , and to feel his hands on her body , to thrill at his kisses ."
"the following night , when he picked her up , she opened the door to her apartment and almost threw herself into his arms , so eager to feel his strong arms around her again ."
"but she was still shy , still not sure she wanted to move this quickly with a man she barely knew so she held back , looking down to hide her excitement ."
"they might have spent hours in each others ' company , but she did n't really know him personally ."
"she knew that he liked italian and middle eastern foods , disliked beer and preferred wine , loved to exercise and teased her about her fear of being alone with him ."
"but she did n't know much about him the man , his past and all the little things that she felt were important ."
"with malik , the important part was just being with him ."
"`` where is al fresco occurring tonight ? ''"
"she asked as she turned to lock her door ."
"malik was having none of that ."
"when she turned around , she gasped when she found him leaning against her door frame , one arm on either side of her head ."
"`` you look lovely , '' he said a moment before he pulled her roughly into his arms , kissing her deeply and pulling her close ."
"siri did n't mind , wanting this as well but she 'd been too shy ."
"malik definitely was n't shy and she loved the way he held her , tormenting her with his body ."
"her hands ran up his muscular arms , her own hands gripping his wide shoulders as she leaned up on her toes to get closer to him ."
"`` we have to get out of here , '' he growled ."
"siri was actually embarrassed to find that her legs were wrapped around his waist , his hands on her bottom to support her while he pressed her back against the wall ."
"her breathing was rapid and she was moving against him ever so slightly , but when he started to let her down , she gripped his shoulders ."
"`` do n't ! ''"
"she gasped and pulled him back , uncaring now if anyone saw them ."
"`` do n't do that , '' she replied and shifted slightly , feeling his erection against her and needing more ."
"`` please , '' she sighed ."
"`` siri , '' he said and pressed her back , his hands moving to her thighs ."
"`` we have to get out of here ."
"i ca n't do this here , '' he said but his head bent down and kissed her again ."
"`` come on , '' he said and lowered her gently down to the ground , watching the tension on her face as she lowered her feet back down to the ground ."
"`` let 's go . ''"
"with those words , he grabbed her hands and pulled her towards the stairs , leading her quickly out into the early evening ."
"without saying a word , he pulled her into the limousine , nodding to the man holding the door ."
"as soon as the door closed , he pulled her into his arms and siri went willingly , not even aware of the driver this time ."
"by the time the car stopped , siri found that she was on his lap , straddling him and his hands were underneath her dress ."
"`` we ca n't do this , malik , '' she said , letting her head drop backwards ."
"`` this is getting painful . ''"
"`` i agree , '' he said and pulled the strap back up on her dress ."
"`` let 's go , '' he said and lifted her up ."
"he easily slid out of the vehicle , then reached back and pulled her out ."
"siri held onto his hand as he led her into the lobby of an unfamiliar building ."
"`` where are we ? ''"
"she asked as he pressed the call button on the elevator ."
"`` at my place . ''"
"the doors to the elevator opened up and siri stepped inside , her heart racing at the implication of his words ."
"`` why are we here ? ''"
"she asked , her stomach falling at both the speed at which they were ascending and the idea he 'd put into her head ."
"`` i think you know the reason , '' he replied , his dark eyes watching her carefully ."
"`` i want you , but i wo n't pressure you ."
"this is a decision you have to make on your own ."
"i could walk across this elevator and take the decision out of your mind and we both know i could , but i want you completely ."
"i want you to make the decision to be with me tonight of your own free will and not something you 'll regret in the morning . ''"
"siri looked up at him , her worried eyes trying to make sense of what he was saying ."
"her body was still singing from his touch in the limousine and now he was promising her more , all uninterrupted ."
"she thought about what he was saying , about the implications and with a smile , she stepped forward , right into his arms ."
"`` you wo n't regret this , '' he said as he pulled her up against him , burying his face in her hair ."
"`` i know , '' she replied , her heart already pounding rapidly and he was n't even kissing her ."
"she was twenty years old and ready for this step ."
"she wanted very badly to know what it was like , but not badly enough to have sex with anyone other than this man with his strong arms , his intelligence and strength , his wit and the way he touched her ."
"he lifted her up and carried her through the penthouse ."
"siri was n't really aware of the passing rooms but she was very conscious of this man and how small and fragile she felt as he held her ."
"`` i 'm going to turn on the lights , '' he said as he lowered her legs down ."
"`` i want to see you , '' he explained gently ."
"siri thought about that and smiled her agreement ."
"she might want the lights off , but then she would n't be able to see him and that would be a shame , she thought ."
"with the soft glow of the bedside table illuminating them , he pulled her back into his arms and kissed her ."
"it was slow and thorough and he did n't stop until the stiffness left her shoulders and she was clinging to him once again ."
"his fingers were in her hair and she reached up , wanting to touch him as well ."
"as she moved against him , she felt his fingers against her stomach , and then against her skin and she gasped with the intensity of that touch ."
"when his hand cupped her breast she jerked backwards , her eyes surprised ."
"but then she realized that she liked the heat , the spark and she slammed right back against him , her hand reaching for his to put his hand back on her breast , moaning with pleasure as his fingers slid along the skin of her breast , his thumb moving against her nipple and she could barely stand as the heat surged through her ."
"clinging to his shoulders , she gasped and moved her own hands up , reveling in the way he felt ."
"it was like hard silk , she thought ."
"with a flick of his wrist , her bra was released and pulled off , tossed behind him and malik pulled back to look down at her half naked body ."
"`` you 're so beautiful , '' he growled and lifted her up so she was laying on the bed , his arms holding him above her as he tasted what he 'd just felt ."
"the moment malik 's mouth covered her nipple siri thought she would explode ."
"her fingers were clenching the fabric of his shirt and she tried to catch her breath , wanting to feel his skin ."
"she tentatively unbuttoned his shirt and let her fingers slide inside , testing to see if he would be angry but his reaction startled her ."
"he came off the bed and tore his shirt off , then came back to her , his hand reaching down and doing exactly as she 'd done a moment ago ."
"as his hand held hers , his eyes closed and she could see he was gritting his teeth as he moved her hand along his skin ."
"when he was sure she would n't move her hand away , he released it and came back to her breast ."
"she knew she 'd found a sensitive spot when his mouth sucked harder and she ached with the need she did n't fully understand ."
"it was almost painful and she lifted her legs , pressing herself against the erection she could feel on her stomach ."
"malik moved to the other breast and siri was n't sure she liked this any longer ."
"`` please , no more , '' she gasped as he teased her nipple , her body aroused to the point where she could n't take any more ."
"or at least she thought that was the case ."
"`` much more , '' malik contradicted and moved down to her stomach ."
"as soon as his mouth was gone from her breast , she missed the intensity and wanted him back , but then he kissed her stomach and she loved that as well , the feeling almost like a tickle , but much more intense ."
"he slid her skirt off , taking her underwear with him and , for the first time , siri felt self-conscious as he looked down at her as she was completely naked ."
"`` do n't be shy , '' he said as his heated gaze took in her long legs and slender waist , her perfectly rounded breasts that were just the right size for his hand ."
"`` it excites me to see you like this , so ready for me and open , knowing that you want me almost as much as i want you . ''"
"with his words , she relaxed and looked up at him ."
"`` are you going to ... . ''"
"`` absolutely , '' he said and efficiently dispensed with his clothes , watching her the whole time ."
"he suppressed a groan when she came up on her elbows , which pushed her breasts out further ."
"they were so perfect , so ripe and sweet , his mouth wanted a longer taste but she was n't used to that and he knew he had to take things slowly ."
"his hands slid along her skin , enjoying how soft and silky she was ."
"he also loved the way she writhed against the bed covers , looking like a goddess with the desire for him shining in her beautiful eyes ."
"he was trying hard , but seeing her like this was making it extremely difficult to hold back ."
"`` i want you , '' he growled as he came back down , feeling her body against his without any hindrance this time ."
"`` i want you to , malik , '' she said and moved against him , her legs automatically moving to make room for him and he inhaled sharply as he felt her heat , so close to his erection he had to lift himself off her or he would push into her ."
"she was n't ready yet , but almost ."
"his hand reached down , sliding along her thighs and she almost closed her legs , afraid of this next step ."
"but as soon as he felt her resistance , he stopped and lowered his head , kissing her until she relaxed again ."
"when he felt her thighs open for him once more , he continued kissing her , moving from her mouth to her neck , then back to her breasts ."
"when he covered her nipple once again , she gasped and her legs lost all resistance ."
"his hand moved to her inner thigh , then higher and he almost lost control when he felt her heat , the wetness that told him she truly was ready for him ."
"he moved slowly , sliding his finger inside her and shaking his head to clear his thoughts , control his body when he felt her clench around his finger ."
"he moved his finger in and out of her tight sheath , then pushed in two fingers ."
"her eyes were closed the whole time and he was free to look down at her , to watch her experience the joys her body could bring her without embarrassing her ."
"when her hips pressed against his hand , he knew she was finally ready for him ."
"he slid his fingers out and positioned himself above her , pulling her legs around his waist and looking her directly in the eye as he slowly , as gently as he could , moved inside her ."
"her mouth opened in surprise as he filled her , feeling his body ache with the need to move faster , to go deeper but holding back so she could adjust to his invasion ."
"`` it 's okay , '' he soothed when she started to pull away and it took all of his strength to stop and wait for her to adjust ."
"when he saw her breath in once again , he pressed on , moving out slightly , then back a bit deeper ."
"he continued to do this until he felt her resistance and had to close his eyes ."
"gathering her close in his arms , he kissed her gently ."
"`` i 'm sorry , siri , '' he said a moment before he pushed into her ."
"he held her in his arms as she stiffened and heard her gasp of pain against his ear ."
"malik held absolutely still while she recovered , not moving at all until he felt her relax ."
"that was all the encouragement he needed ."
"still moving slowly , he slid in and out of her heat , watching her face as she experienced pleasure like this for the first time ."
"he loved the way she moved instinctively against her , feeling her heat , the ecstasy of her body against his , clenching against him and driving him insane with the need to move faster ."
"`` do n't stop , '' she cried out when she thought he was slowing down ."
"her eyes closed as she lifted her hips to meet his thrusts and her fingers curled against his arms and shoulders ."
"`` do n't worry , '' he groaned and could n't help it when he moved faster , needing her and watching her face to gauge her response ."
"when her head fell back , he knew she was okay and moved slightly faster ."
"she took all of him , her legs lifting to take him deeper inside of her and he struggled to control his climax to ensure that she came first ."
"when he knew that he was about to lose control , he moved his hand down , teasing her and watched in fascination as she splintered almost immediately into her first orgasm ."
"he could only watch for a moment before her climax brought on his own and he slammed into her as intense waves of desire washed over him ."
"siri 's arms relaxed and she felt as if her whole body were made of jell-o ."
"the world could be falling apart outside this room and she would n't even care ."
"`` are you okay ? ''"
"he asked , lifting himself off of her , but not letting her go ."
"he rolled over onto his back , pulling her close against him ."
"he loved the way she snuggled against him , her leg even coming up to slide against his ."
"`` more than okay , '' she sighed and her hand moved against his ridged stomach , replete with happiness ."
"he pulled away to clean up in the bathroom , but he was back in moments and pulling her back against his side ."
"`` i 'm sorry i 've missed this , '' she said , referring to the fact that this was her first time ."
"he looked down at her , his anger sharp and intense ."
"`` you 're mine , siri !"
"what we shared will be only between us , '' he commanded ."
"she was touched by his possessiveness , when in other men it would be irritating ."
"`` i know ."
"i was just kidding ."
"i have n't even been tempted by any other man ."
"you know that , '' she said as her hand soothed against his jaw ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i should n't have made a comment like that . ''"
"he relaxed and nodded ."
"`` you 're mine , siri , '' he said again ."
"`` does that mean you 're mine ? ''"
"she asked , pushing her hair out of her eyes and lifting herself higher so she was looking down on him for a change ."
"`` do you want me ? ''"
"he teased , his hand sliding up her back , then down again to smooth against her bottom , making her wiggle and blush at the intimate touch ."
"`` i think i do , '' she said with a grin ."
"`` are you going to take me ? ''"
"he asked and re-situated her so that she was laying completely on top of him ."
"`` are n't i heavy ? ''"
"she asked , worried that she might be too much for him ."
"he laughed and shook his head ."
"`` you 're too light , '' he countered ."
"she moved her legs , but his hands stopped her , forcing her legs to straddle him instead ."
"`` that 's better , '' he replied , his voice husky ."
"from that night on , whenever he was in town , she was in his arms , spending the nights with him ."
"he was so busy that there were periods when she only saw him once during the month ."
"other times he was able to get away twice and they spent long weekends walking along the river , holding hands and dining out ."
"but mostly , they spent their time in bed , finding new ways to love each other ."
"she never said the words , but siri was totally , completely , madly in love with this man who continued to surprise her ."
"he was older than her by twelve years but she did n't feel as if he ever spoke down to her ."
"he listened while she spoke , helped her study for her exams , even gave her tips on research papers ."
"and never spoke about his feelings for her ."
"so she kept hers a secret as well , loving the man , but knowing there was a large part of him he kept secret ."
"for instance , she still had no idea what he did for a living ."
"every time she met him he was coming or going from one meeting or another ."
"when she asked him about it , he explained that he was negotiating a contract , but never gave her details about what kind of contract , or what company he worked for ."
"he seemed to be meeting with very high level people , but he was n't a name dropper , so she did n't know who he met with or why ."
"she knew he was extremely wealthy because his 'apartment ' was the penthouse of one of the most expensive buildings in the city ."
"she also knew that he had several body guards and he had n't arranged for the limousine for her benefit , but because that was simply the way he traveled ."
"she did n't ask many questions about that either , not sure she wanted the answers ."
"six months into the affair , she was coming out of the bathroom , snuggled into his enormous white robe and rubbing her hair with a towel after her shower ."
"she 'd woken about a half hour ago after spending the night in malik 's arms ."
"she had n't gotten much sleep , but she did n't come here for sleep ."
"she came to be with him , to make love with him and enjoy his company ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"she asked when he walked into the room , wearing only a pair of jeans ."
"he pulled her into his arms and kissed her ."
"`` good morning , '' he said , as his hands slipped inside the robe ."
"`` you look beautiful , as always . ''"
"she laughed up at him and shook her head ."
"`` you 're not getting out of answering my question ."
"why did you look so concerned when you first walked in here ?"
"is something wrong ? ''"
"he sighed and pulled her over to the bed ."
"`` my father just called ."
"i have to get home quickly , '' he explained , but he did n't seem to be in any kind of hurry ."
"he sat down on the edge of the bed and held the ties of her robe in both hands , pulling gently ."
"`` should n't you be getting dressed ? ''"
"she asked , her body already reacting to the look in his eyes ."
"he was n't even glancing at his watch , preferring to watch the white , terry cloth fabric as he pulled the edges slowly apart ."
"he shook his head slightly , his eyes intent as he looked at her naked body , still pink from the heat of the shower ."
"`` i should be right here ."
"wondering what 's underneath this robe , '' he countered ."
"she pulled the edges closed , refusing to let him pull the robe off ."
"`` you already know what 's underneath , '' she laughed ."
"`` you saw enough of me last night ."
"if your father needs you , why are n't you rushing to his side ? ''"
"`` my father can wait a while ."
"i have a very short memory when it comes to your body ."
"i think i need a refresher . ''"
"she chuckled and tried to step back ."
"`` you have a photographic memory . ''"
"he would n't let her move back but instead , yanked her forward , catching her in his arms and tumbling over her onto the bed so he was looking down at her ."
"`` i like how you think you can outmaneuver me , '' he said a moment before he took her ear lobe with his teeth ."
"`` it always amuses me . ''"
"she laughed and tried to wiggle away ."
"`` well , that 's what i 'm here for ."
"just for your entertainment . ''"
"he stilled and pulled away , suddenly looking at her seriously ."
"`` do n't say that , '' he said sternly ."
"`` say what ? ''"
"she 'd never seen him look at her like that , as if he were worried and angry at the same time ."
"`` you 're not just my entertainment , '' he replied , his eyes serious ."
"she reached up and touched his cheek ."
"`` i know ."
"i 'm sorry ."
"i did n't mean to belittle what we have together . ''"
"he watched her for a moment before turning his face into her hand , kissing her palm ."
"`` do n't forget it , '' he growled before pulling her close , becoming serious for a whole different reason ."
"that was the last time she saw him in person ."
"three days later , siri was sitting in their tiny apartment when linda arrived back from the grocery store , her eyes wide with concern ."
"she placed the groceries on the kitchen table and looked over at siri , one hand hiding something behind her ."
"`` what 's up ? ''"
"siri asked as linda walked into the apartment and sat down across from her ."
"`` you look worried about something . ''"
"`` did you know where malik is from ? ''"
"siri shrugged and glanced down at her economics book ."
"`` he 's mentioned traveling to several countries lately , but he told me he 's originally from duban . ''"
"linda cringed and crossed her legs , obviously about to say something horrible and not sure how to convey the message ."
"`` do you know anything else about him ? ''"
"siri closed her economics book and started to become worried ."
"`` i know that he hates broccoli and asparagus , loves the opera and ballet and rides horses extremely well ."
"other than that , most of my knowledge is about the conversations we 've had on various subjects . ''"
"she watched linda 's eyes , concern growing ."
"`` has something happened to him ?"
"is he okay ?"
"please tell me he 's not hurt . ''"
"`` he 's not , '' linda assured her quickly ."
"`` it 's nothing like that . ''"
"she looked out the window briefly before bringing her gaze back to the floor , unable to look siri in the eyes ."
"`` at least , i have n't heard anything like that . ''"
"siri relaxed and leaned back against the worn cushions ."
"`` whew !"
"you were starting to worry me ."
"i could n't figure out what might be so concerning about malik ."
"has something happened in duban ? ''"
"linda looked at the newspaper , then back up at siri ."
"`` you could say that , '' she said and handed the paper to siri with the headlines on the front page , pointing to the lead story so siri could easily see the issue ."
"siri glanced down , not sure what she might read ."
"but the picture was bad enough ."
"on the front page was a picture of the royal family of duban , with malik in the middle ."
"if that was n't bad enough , the woman with the beautiful smile and long , flowing black hair , gazing up at him with adoring eyes , was enough to make siri feel sick ."
"`` crown prince malik bin saqqaf , sheik of duban married yesterday in a formal ceremony . ''"
"the article went on to give the woman 's name and describe the ceremony , explain why everyone should care about this marriage , but all siri could see was malik 's handsome face , looking stern , almost angry , as he stared out from the picture while surrounded by his family and new bride ."
"`` i need to go , '' siri said and hurried into her bedroom , slamming the door behind her ."
"she could n't face linda after reading the article ."
"she could n't face anyone ."
"by the time she 'd read the last word that described the elaborate ceremony and the exciting engagement , the surprise to the whole world that the crown prince was engaged without anyone in the world knowing , she was numb , unable to process anything else in her own sphere ."
"she did n't cry ."
"not for several days ."
"she could n't cry , could n't believe that he 'd actually done this to her ."
"he 'd betrayed her ."
"he 'd cheated on her , he 'd lied to her and married only days after spending the night with her !"
"a full week went by and siri barely came out of her room ."
"she drank coffee and had toast when linda forced it on her ."
"she went to her classes but did n't hear anything ."
"she walked around campus , but barely knew what was going on ."
"living on coffee most of the time , she did n't even care that her grades had fallen or that she had lost so much weight that her clothes could barely stay on her figure ."
"she 'd been thin before , but now she could only be described as gaunt ."
"she did n't even realize that her friends were discussing how best to help her , because none of their suggestions even broke through the pain filled haze she was living in ."
"it took over a month before siri felt well enough to talk to linda about malik and even then , she 'd barely gotten out a few words before she broke down in tears ."
"linda was the epitome of patience , but even she could n't help her friend through this kind of betrayal ."
"letters came addressed to her in malik 's handwriting , but siri returned them all , rejecting any explanation he might have ."
"nothing he said could justify what he 'd done to her ."
"she was n't sure how she would have felt if he 'd told her about his engagement before she 'd become intimate ."
"would she have understood ?"
"surely she would n't have felt so ... .abused , so completely ... .she could n't really put a name to what she was feeling ."
"her pain seemed to be beyond anything she 'd felt before ."
"siri had dated men in the past , had even thought she 'd cared about them ."
"but never had she considered becoming intimate with any of them , nor had she given her heart and her soul so completely as she 'd done with malik ."
"she 'd trusted him with her heart , with the most intimate part of her and he 'd stomped on that trust , on her love ."
"not that she 'd actually told him how she 'd felt ."
"and thank goodness for that , she thought one day on the way to one of her classes ."
"and then the brutal part happened ."
"two months after that last weekend , siri found herself in the bathroom throwing up , her whole body wracked with the pain of emptying an already empty stomach ."
"a few hours later , she felt fine and went to class , but when the same thing happened the following day , she had to question what was really happening ."
"a pregnancy test confirmed her fears ."
"and a month later , a sonogram confirmed twins ."
"siri had sent a letter to malik but was n't sure how to address the letter ."
"the news that she was pregnant was hard to write , but she was as plain as possible , not elaborating but just stating the news ."
"she gave him the facts , about her due date , the twins , she did n't know the gender but that the babies were healthy so far ."
"she outlined the plan the doctor had given her for the pregnancy , how she would have additional appointments to ensure that the babies were delivered successfully and healthy and anything else she could relate about the pregnancy while leaving out anything personal ."
"when the letter arrived back , she crushed it in her fist , scared out of her mind at idea of facing parenthood as a single mother ."
"in the back of her mind , she realized that she 'd still held out the hope that he would come to her and tell her that the marriage to another woman was n't real , that he loved her and would push the other woman aside so they could be married themselves and raise their babies together ."
"the rejection of that letter was yet another slap in the face to her hopes and dreams and siri hated malik even more for that ."
"going back to her parents after that last semester had been horrible but both her mother and father were delighted that they were going to be grandparents ."
"they helped her finish school and start her business , encouraging her the whole way ."
"when the twins were born , they were right there helping her through every moment and she loved them for all of their support ."
"she 'd gotten through it , siri thought , looking around at her office , now papered with the pictures jacob and sam had made during preschool art classes ."
"she 'd started her business out of her parent 's house , starting out only as an online distribution website for educational toys ."
"as success came , she expanded to a store in one of the suburbs , and then two , and now she had five stores , plus her online business had more than doubled over the past year with internet sales skyrocketing ."
"she could work from home when the boys were sick and , since she was the boss , it was easier for her to be at their programs , to celebrate the small and the large events of their lives ."
"as hard as it had been initially , she was finally at a place where she felt secure , and that she had things somewhat under control ."
"and now life hits her with another whammy !"
"why was he divorcing ?"
"and did she even care ?"
"after that first month , he had n't tried to get in touch with her ."
"she 'd read about two years ago that his father had died and he 'd taken full control of the country ."
"it seemed strange that the man she 'd laughed with and made love to throughout all hours of the night , who was the secret father of her children was actually ruler of one of the wealthiest countries in the world ."
"`` joe needs you on the floor , '' her assistant said , poking her head into siri 's office ."
"`` something about a sale to hong kong . ''"
"siri blinked and came back to the present ."
"she did n't have time to deal with this now ."
"malik was far away dealing with his problems and she had to deal with her own ."
"wherever he was , whatever he was doing , she could n't let it interfere with the raising of her boys and , besides lots of hugs and kisses , her business was the core of that care ."
"she could n't let them down ."
"standing up , she took a moment to straighten the files on her desk , then went down to the warehouse floor to figure out what the problem was ."
"malik watched as siri moved about the warehouse ."
"she was grace and elegance and she 'd actually become more beautiful over the past four years ."
"he could n't count the number of hours he 'd spent fantasizing about being with her again ."
"the past four years had been the hardest of his life but he was now free to pursue the woman he was meant to be with ."
"he was fascinated by the way she moved about ."
"she was so efficient and professional ."
"the woman he 'd known had been intelligent and witty , but also shy around other people ."
"this woman approached the employees with confidence and a smile ."
"although he could n't hear her words , with each person , she treated them with respect and it seemed as if she was encouraging them while speaking with each one ."
"she was stronger , he thought as she carried a clip board around , checking in with her employees and asking questions , always leaving them with a smile to show that she respected them and appreciated their work and their time ."
"he 'd expect nothing less of her , he just wished he 'd been around to watch the transformation ."
"once again , he cursed the forces that had required his marriage , specifically his father who had destroyed treaties that had ended badly with violence ."
"he understood why his father had done that , and might even agree with him , but he had n't liked the resolution to the hostilities , which had been his marriage to the daughter of a tribal leader , one that would unite their two families and ensure peace ."
"his marriage had been a necessity , one that he 'd carried out as an obligation , but there had been no love between him and his wife ."
"they 'd both made a half hearted effort to make the relationship work , but between the politics and the regional fighting , the separations and ... .well , lots of things , their marriage had been bound to fail from the beginning ."
"that was fine with him though ."
"he had n't wanted to marry her , he 'd wanted siri ."
"but siri had n't had the right political connections and his ex-wife had been perfect for the job ."
"so they 'd both done what they 'd been raised to do , and that was to protect their countries and create a bond ."
"now that the bond was no longer needed , they had parted ways , leaving him free to pursue this woman who became more interesting the more he watched ."
"he was standing in the office area high above the warehouse but he could see down from the window that looked into the vast warehouse space ."
"he saw siri 's efficient and bubbly assistant as she tried to catch her boss , but the assistant with her bright , curly hair was on one side of the warehouse , while siri was on the other ."
"although the amusing chase was interesting , he did n't have a great deal of time , nor any patience to wait ."
"he 'd waited four years to see his woman and he was n't going to delay any longer than necessary ."
"he wanted siri in his arms and in his bed , he wanted to pick up where they left off and find a way to forge a future between the two of them ."
"he 'd already cleared the path for their marriage with his advisors ."
"he had n't asked , he 'd told them who he was going after ."
"with his marriage behind him , they all agreed enthusiastically that a new marriage , to a woman malik cared for , was the answer to ensuring prosperity in the kingdom and longevity of his line ."
"malik watched with a chuckle as the assistant 's head bobbed in one direction in search of siri , while their prey moved in the opposite direction ."
"obviously , this was n't the most effective way to bring siri to him , he realized ."
"malik pulled out his cell phone and dialed the number his assistant had given him ."
"sure enough , as soon as he heard the answering ring , siri looked down at her waist where her cell phone was attached ."
"she glanced at the phone number and he could even see her biting her lip in indecision ."
"he almost chuckled when she pressed the `` ignore '' button and slammed the phone back into the holder at her waist ."
"she was cute when she was irritated , but that also gave him an idea of what was coming ."
"instead of calling her again , which she would probably ignore once again , he texted her a message , then pressed send and waited , watching for her reaction ."
"siri looked at her clip board again but the words and numbers did n't register in her mind ."
"that phone number ... .it could n't be him ."
"could it ?"
"how could he have the same phone number he 'd had four years ago ?"
"and why in the world had she remembered that phone number ?"
"this definitely was n't the same phone so she did n't have the number programmed in as she had in the past ."
"when he 'd called four years ago , his name had popped up on the small screen and she 'd eagerly taken the call , excited to find out when he would be back in chicago ."
"now , however , she wanted nothing to do with the man ."
"burn me once , shame on you ."
"burn me twice , shame on me ."
"there was no way she was even talking to the man who left her one day and turned up married to another woman the next day , without a word or explanation ."
"okay , so he might have tried to explain in the letters she 'd rejected , but at the time , she was too furious with him for any explanations ."
"then , once she found out she was pregnant and her own letter had come back rejected , she 'd been too terrified of what was to come ."
"explanations were n't worth much at that point , she 'd needed help and she 'd gotten none , except from her mother and father who had been absolutely wonderful throughout her whole terrifying and difficult pregnancy ."
"he had no idea how hard it is to carry twins , attend classes and start one 's business all at the same time !"
"he could rot at the other end of the line for all she cared !"
"the man was as good as dead in her heart ."
"how dare he even try to call her after all these years , she fumed !"
"his first marriage ended so now he 's going to try and pick up where he left off ?"
"as if nothing had occurred in between ?"
"as if he had n't completely rejected everything they stood for while they 'd been together ?"
"what arrogance !"
"there she went again , thinking that he might have thought their relationship as significant as she had ."
"to him , she 'd probably just been an affair , a whim ."
"she 'd come to the conclusion that she 'd been his `` port '' lady , the woman he comes to when he 's in this particular city but meant nothing to him since he most likely had , and still had , women in several other ports that met his needs there ."
"she had to stop thinking that she 'd meant anything at all to him ."
"if she had , he never could have betrayed her like that ."
"goodness , why was she even thinking about all this ?"
"she had work to do and a phone call from a man who had abandoned her was not going to distract her from her goals for the day ."
"she had shipments to review , both incoming and outgoing ."
"she had payroll to approve , a marketing meeting later this afternoon , financial reports to go over , new products to test and a million other things that were more urgent ... she did n't have time to dream about painful methods of retribution to a man she 'd never see again since he was a million miles away ."
"she was walking towards the loading docks when her cell phone vibrated , indicating a text message ."
"she looked at the screen and almost dropped the phone ."
"'i 've missed you ' was all the screen said , but the phone number from which the message had come was from that same number , the one she was n't going to touch !"
"she deleted the text , ignoring it completely and headed towards the busy loading docks once again , furious that the obnoxious man thought he could just casually pop back into her life ."
"she was almost to the docks when her phone vibrated again ."
"she almost dropped the clip board in her fury , but was able to control herself ."
"barely ."
"`` can we meet ? ''"
"the message said ."
"siri wanted to throw her phone across the bustling warehouse ."
"the crash would be very satisfying , but unfortunately , it was n't malik 's arrogant head so it would n't really count ."
"and it would only cost her more money and time to replace her phone and that man had cost her a whole lot of money ."
"well , to be fair , he 'd also gifted her with her two little wonderful boys ."
"she glanced down at her watch and was relieved that she still had some precious time before she had to pick them up ."
"she really just needed to focus and get through her day before it became too late ."
"the next message came just as she was about to call over her loading manager , a barrel chested man with an old fashioned handlebar mustache in his late fifties who pushed through the merchandise with a tight leash , ensuring that all shipments were accurate and on time ."
"since hiring him three years ago , her complaints had dropped to almost nothing ."
"the man was a genuine treasure and had relieved a great deal of stress when he 'd implemented his shipping procedures soon after his arrival ."
"`` hi joe , '' she called out as she approached , forcing her mind to concentrate on the shipments that were coming in and not on the text messages she 'd just received ."
"`` how are the latest shipments ?"
"will they be ready in time for ... . ''"
"she started to ask but then shook her head ."
"`` joe , i apologize ."
"i wo n't even finish that question because i know you have it all under control and any shipments that are scheduled to go out will happen ."
"i 'm just losing focus today and it 's coming out in odd ways . ''"
"she almost picked up her cell phone and glared at it just for good measure but knew that the effort would be lost on the inanimate object ."
"joe 's eyes widened slightly and then he chuckled , his mustache twitching merrily ."
"`` thanks for the unexpected compliment ms. siri , but feel free to ask anything you 'd like ."
"we have all one hundred and fifty parcels ready to ship in the next hour and gerry is at the packaging conveyor belt making sure that tomorrow 's shipments are ready as well ."
"we have the computer checklist tory built up last month and it 's working real well so we 're actually slightly ahead of schedule ."
"by the end of this month , we should be even better and only the last minute , overnight orders will be a daily exception . ''"
"the man 's voice was gruff from years of yelling at the nascar races and probably too many cigarettes and beer , but he was a gem as a manager ."
"`` thanks joe ."
"sorry for the questions ."
"just trying to outrun something . ''"
"or someone , she thought with irritation ."
"she turned on her heel and walked back towards the offices , determined to get payroll finished before she left for the night ."
"mary , her payroll manager , was already hard at work ensuring that all fifty-nine employees got paid on time and she 'd never missed a deadline yet , but she also needed siri 's approval to make those deadlines ."
"again , her cell phone vibrated and siri considered just ignoring the message this time , sure that whatever message just came through , it was definitely from him ."
"she did n't want to know what he had to say ."
"but her eyes glanced down and she gasped when she read the words , `` you look beautiful , by the way . ''"
"chapter 3 how could he know what she looked like ?"
"was he here ?"
"how could he know ?"
"was he just saying that to mess with her mind ?"
"it was n't his style , but who knows what he is like now ."
"`` the red sweater looks good , '' came the next message ."
"with those words , she knew that he was here ."
"in her warehouse !"
"there was no way he could know what she was wearing from over in duban or wherever he might be in the world !"
"he could only know she was wearing a red sweater if he was actually looking at her ."
"she looked around , her heart pounding and her hands starting to sweat ."
"she could n't believe that he was actually here !"
"fury pounded through her and she glanced up towards her office window ."
"sure enough , there he was , standing in the window watching her ."
"how long had he been there ?"
"had he been watching her the whole time ."
"she glanced down at her cell phone , noting the time of the first call ."
"he 'd been here for at least fifteen minutes !"
"damn that man !"
"there was no way she would allow him to invade her space ."
"this was her personal domain and she would n't permit him to come here and fluster her or make her crazy the way he 'd been doing for the past few minutes !"
"he 'd given up the right to speak to her casually , to give her compliments or anything else four years ago when he 'd married another woman only days after spending the night with her !"
"dorothy , her assistant , rushed up to her , out of breath and sweating slightly ."
"`` i finally found you !"
"there 's a guy up in your office ."
"a gorgeous guy !"
"he asked if he could see you and he has the most amazing accent you 've ever heard !"
"and he 's buff ! ''"
"she finally finished , her eyes wide with excitement and curiosity ."
"the woman was completely discrete about anything that was happening in the office , but siri looked at her flushed cheeks and knew she 'd never confide her relationship with malik to anyone here in the warehouse or office ."
"knowing that dorothy expected siri to drop everything she was doing so she could run up and see the 'buff ' guy only irritated siri more , but she tried to hide it ."
"dorothy was n't the target here ."
"it was all on malik 's end that she wanted to shoot darts at ."
"`` why is he here ? ''"
"siri asked , gritting her teeth to keep from snapping off her assistant 's head at the idea that malik was 'gorgeous ' ."
"if she only knew what kind of a weasel that man was , dorothy would n't think he was so nice to look at ."
"no amount of muscles could compensate for a poor character and low morals ."
"dorothy 's curls bounced as she pointed towards the offices above the warehouse ."
"`` he said something about wanting to talk with you ."
"he mentioned he was an old friend . ''"
"`` old enemy , more like it , '' siri mumbled underneath her breath ."
"`` thanks dorothy ."
"tell mary i 'll be in to approve the payroll in a moment ."
"i just need to get rid of a bug . ''"
"dorothy stared after her boss , eyes wide at the idea that the man in her office could possibly be the bug upon which her boss might stomp ."
"surely she 'd misunderstood ."
"the charming , marvelous fellow she 'd spoken to several minutes ago could never be thought of as an unwanted pest !"
"either that , or her boss was just teasing ."
"yes , that must be it , she thought as she watched siri walked with determination towards the offices ."
"`` if you do n't want him , send him my way ! ''"
"dorothy called out ."
"siri barely hesitated as she heard her assistant 's bellow ."
"`` believe me , you do n't want this kind of cockroach , '' siri called back ."
"she practically ran up the metal stairs in order to get to her office more quickly ."
"she wanted malik out of her office , out of her warehouse and out of her life ."
"she hated this man so deeply she could n't believe that she had it in her ."
"`` who the hell do you think ... '' she started to say but he cut her off , simply by taking her into his arms and covering her angry mouth with his ."
"his kiss was hot , sexy and so blatantly erotic there was nothing siri could do but kiss him back ."
"her clip board fell to the floor , forgotten as her hands gripped the lapels of his perfectly tailored charcoal suit ."
"his hands , which had been holding both sides of her face , moved down to pull her against him , to show her that he was just as affected by the kiss as she was ."
"by the time he lifted his head , siri was clinging to him , her mind a jumble and her voice whimpering with need she 'd thought was pushed out of her life at his departure four years ago ."
"as he looked down at her , his eyes smiling into her stunned ones , he kissed her cheek and her ear , before pulling back once again to look at her ."
"`` i 've missed you , siri , '' he said softly , his hands roaming over her back and sending shivers of anticipation all over her body ."
"no one knew how to touch a woman , how to touch her , like malik ."
"he knew all of her secrets , all the places on her body that sent excitement and desire zinging through her system and he used all of that knowledge to his benefit now ."
"siri pulled back just far enough , then with all of her might , she swung out , smacking him hard on his cheek ."
"her hand stung from the impact and she could see the red imprint of her hand on his cheek but was unaware of the tears streaming down her cheeks ."
"`` get out ! ''"
"she growled ."
"`` i never want to see you again ! ''"
"she tried to take a deep breath to calm down , but her body 's betrayal had only made her angrier ."
"`` i ca n't believe you would do something like that after so many years and after what you did ! ''"
"he started to say something but she picked up her clipboard and shook her head ."
"`` get out of my office , get out of my warehouse and get out of my life ! ''"
"she swung around and was just about to leave her office when he grabbed her arm , swinging her around and pushing her against the wall by the door to her office ."
"`` i deserved the slap ."
"i know that and i 'm sorry for the pain i caused you in the past ."
"but i can explain , '' he said , his voice rough and yet still soft , gently soothing ."
"she tried to jerk away , but no matter how soft his voice , his hands were steel around her waist ."
"`` do n't touch me ! ''"
"she snapped and tried to look away when his finger came up and touched her cheek , tenderly wiping away the tears on her flushed cheek ."
"`` i 'll leave now , but we 're going to talk ."
"after that kiss we just shared , you know there 's something still between us and we can make this work ."
"you just have to let it ."
"you 're angry now and i deserve it all , and probably a lot more ."
"but we can work through this and make things better . ''"
"`` you can just ... '' she started to say something , but shook her head and took a deep breath ."
"`` you 're not going to get to me , '' she said with as much dignity as possible under the circumstances ."
"`` you left four years ago , you can just leave again . ''"
"with that , she turned around and headed down the office hallway , uncaring of where she was going as long as it was the opposite direction from him ."
"she wanted to be as far away from him as she could get , but the warehouse offices were n't very large ."
"she walked to the kitchen and looked out the front window , seeing the long , elegant limousine parked out front ."
"she swallowed painfully since the car reminded her of the times he 'd picked her up in those long ago ."
"why had n't she looked into him more carefully ?"
"why had she just let things go , happy to be with him and not asking any questions ?"
"she was n't stupid , she should have asked questions , been curious at least ."
"she 'd never asked any questions about his past , about his family ."
"he 'd never offered and she had n't wanted to pry into issues he did n't offer information about ."
"looking back , she should have demanded answers to things that did n't make sense ."
"she should have refused to enter into an intimate relationship with a man she did n't fully know ."
"but at the time , she 'd been overwhelmed by everything about him and the way he made her feel ."
"she sank down into the one of the kitchen chairs , lowering her head onto her palm , trying to calm down enough to go back to work ."
"out of the corner of her eye she saw the limousine pull away and drive out of the parking lot and thought she even saw two dark suvs in front of and following the long car ."
"yet another mystery , she thought ."
"wiping the tears away , she pushed herself up and forced herself to walk down to mary 's office ."
"`` is payroll ready yet ? ''"
"she asked , trying for an even tone ."
"mary did a double take when she saw siri 's face ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"siri shook her head and smiled ."
"`` nothing ."
"i just had a bad memory but it 's gone now ."
"everything is fine . ''"
"they went through the payroll issues , but siri 's mind was stuck on malik and his parting words ."
"what did he mean about not being finished ?"
"did he mean that he was n't gone ?"
"it did n't matter if he decided that things were n't finished between the two of them ."
"she was n't some powerless college kid just hanging out waiting for her big shot boyfriend to sweep into town and pick her up ."
"she was a business woman with things to do , children to raise and ... ."
"oh no !"
"what would malik do if he realized that jacob and samuel were his sons ?"
"had n't the paper mentioned something about him not being able to conceive with his first wife ?"
"what would he do if he realized he had a ready made heir already set to be trained ?"
"`` i need to go , mary , '' siri said quickly , fighting the panic that was threatening to overwhelm her and left the office ."
"`` wait , did you need me to sign anything ? ''"
"`` here , '' mary replied , pointing to the end of month payroll statement ."
"she pointed out several items that needed siri 's approval , explained a few other issues and then nodded when all was signed at the bottom , allowing the payroll to be disbursed ."
"normally they went through the statement more thoroughly , but siri simply could n't focus on the numbers today ."
"not after malik 's visit !"
"`` thanks mary ."
"i 'm sorry i was so distracted today . ''"
"`` no problem ."
"we can go over the details tomorrow . ''"
"`` thanks , '' siri said and rushed out of the building ."
"she was a little earlier than normal to pick up her boys , but not abnormally so ."
"sometimes she would pick them up and just go to the park ."
"she 'd do that today , just to spend some time with them , to make sure they were okay which was completely ridiculous except that she knew of the imminent threat to their compact little world ."
"the thought of malik finding out about them was so terrifying , she could n't even conceive of what would happen ."
"he needed heirs , and apparently , there was a great deal of pressure for him to marry immediately and have sons to carry on his legacy and the prosperity of malik 's reign ."
"but the man did n't know that he already had two perfectly healthy children , who were absolutely wonderful and spirited and intelligent and ... ."
"no , she would n't allow them to be taken away from her ."
"he 'd rejected them four years ago , he could just go have children with someone other female !"
"let those kids be his heir , away from everything that was normal to them ."
"she did n't want her boys to have that kind of royal pressure and to have their future choices taken away from them at the tender age of three ."
"she wanted them to be raised with hugs and kisses and the fear of asking out a girl for the first time , of football games and soccer and she might even torture them with piano lessons ."
"she automatically stopped at a red light and rested her head on the hard , unforgiving steering wheel ."
"was she doing the right thing ?"
"if the roles were reversed , how would she feel if he hid her children from him ?"
"it did n't matter if it was a ridiculous argument , she knew exactly how she would feel if her children were hidden from her knowledge ."
"she 'd be furious and livid and would feel betrayed ."
"she could n't do that to him ."
"hiding his sons ' existence was the wrong thing to do ."
"he 'd rejected her letter , but how could he have known what was in the letter ?"
"she could n't use that weak argument any longer , it was n't fair ."
"especially after she 'd coldly rejected so many of his letters first and without wanting any explanation from him ."
"the issue was pointless anyway ."
"whether he had rejected the letter or not , there were certain moral issues that rose above petty rejections or arguments of who rejected whom first ."
"it was his flesh and blood and he deserved to know the truth ."
"she 'd had no way of contacting him before , but she could n't even pull that point off the charts now that he was here , in chicago and trying to see her ."
"a horn honked behind her and she jumped , looking around and trying to figure out where she was ."
"the light had turned green and she quickly accelerated through the intersection , making her way carefully to the preschool building without really thinking about the directions ."
"thankfully , she did n't cause an accident or get into one ."
"at least , she did n't think so ."
"at this point , she was n't completely sure what was going on around her since thoughts of her boys being taken away from her so they could be trained to be royal beings rolled through her mind in a nightmarish tableau of heartbreak and loneliness , of having no say in how her boys were raised once malik took them away from her ."
"she forced a smile as she passed by the classrooms , nodding as politely as possible to the teachers as she walked in , but inside , her heart was breaking ."
"this might be the last , normal night she 'd have with these little guys ."
"she 'd call malik tonight and give him the news ."
"he 'd probably want to meet them ."
"and she was sure her little boys would want to meet their father ."
"she stopped and watched her guys through the window , smiling as they laughed about something only they could hear since the two of them were sitting next to each other , building again with their curly haired heads bent towards each other ."
"goodness , they loved building things , she thought with a heart full of love ."
"jacob looked up and glanced through the classroom observation window , his chubby face breaking out into a huge smile when he spotted her ."
"he immediately jabbed sam who repeated the process ."
"two peas in a pod , she thought and pushed away from the wall and walked in , loving their exuberant greeting as they both threw themselves into her arms , their strong little arms wrapping around her neck ."
"yes , this was all worth all the frustrations of being a single mother of twins ."
"completely worth every moment !"
"and , sadly , she could n't deny malik this happiness either ."
"they were rational , intelligent human beings ."
"between the two of them , they could figure out an equitable compromise that would be good for the boys as well as for the other parties involved ."
"surely there was a way to work something out , she told herself with what little optimism she could muster ."
"surely there could be a sharing agreement set up ."
"she almost started crying at the idea of these two little fellows not being with her every night , safely tucked into their toddler beds where she knew they were safe ."
"malik would keep them from harm , she was sure ."
"he might be a rat in the romance department , but these little guys represented the future of his country ."
"he would n't let anything happen to them ."
"she gathered their preschool bags , spoke briefly with their favorite teacher about the day , then walked them out to the car before tucking them up in their car seats for the short drive home ."
"she would call malik as soon as they were settled for the night , she told herself ."
"after they were tucked in , she would give him the news , they would talk , they would figure out how to move forward and arrange for a meeting with him and the boys ."
"he might not believe they were hers , she knew ."
"and if he rejected them , all the better ."
"she would then have done her part and tried to do the right thing ."
"if he tossed it back in her face , she would be ecstatically happy to have her sons all to herself once again ."
"when they walked into the house and both of them raced to the backyard , jumping up and down , begging her to let them play outside for just a little bit longer before dinner , she relented with a sigh ."
"as she watched them roll around and play on their toddler sized swing and slide , she picked up her cell phone , deciding to get the pain over with as quickly as possible ."
"since malik had called her earlier , she had his phone number in her cell phone ."
"she just had to press the re-dial button and she 'd be connected to him ."
"her finger shook as she pressed the button , wishing she could ignore what was right and just keep her precious boys all to herself ."
"she listened carefully as malik 's end rang once , twice , then went to voice mail ."
"it was n't his voice , but a computer generated message that asked the caller to leave a message ."
"`` malik , this is siri ."
"i ... we ... there 's something you should know , '' she started off awkwardly ."
"`` i mean , we need to talk ."
"i need to tell you something . ''"
"she took a deep breath and closed her eyes ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i 'm making a mess of this ."
"would you mind calling me back ? ''"
"she left her cell phone number , then felt silly since he already had her cell phone number , which was exactly why she had his number ."
"as soon as he listened he would think she 'd become a complete , rambling idiot !"
"needing to end the horrible conversation quickly , she finished with , `` anyway , thanks and i look forward to hearing from you . ''"
"she pressed the end button , then tossed her phone into her purse , feeling ridiculous for sounding so insecure and tentative ."
"and why in the world had she said she was 'looking forward ' to hearing from him ?"
"she was dreading the next time she heard his voice , wanting to toss the cell phone into the freezer or oven just so she would n't be able to hear it when he called back ."
"then again , what was she supposed to say ?"
"'would you mind stopping by at your convenience to meet your two sons ?"
"yes , they 're twins , three years old and adorable ."
"no , you ca n't take them away from me either . '"
"siri did n't really feel like that was the best way to break the news to an ex-boyfriend about his current fatherhood ."
"with a sigh , she watched jacob as he climbed the ladder on the small play set she had set up in her fenced in back yard ."
"the boys loved that set , thought it was so wonderful but already they were growing too big for it ."
"sam slid down the two foot slide , laughing at the bottom as if it were a joke ."
"and then jacob slid down , right on top of sam causing both of them to laugh even harder ."
"they were large for their age , always had been ."
"she remembered the doctor 's expression during each prenatal visit when he charted their growth , impressed with how quickly they were growing in utero ."
"it was n't such a surprise to siri ."
"she knew how large and tall malik was and her sons were showing every sign of taking after him in both brawn and height ."
"as she watched them laughing and playing , their rambunctious activities made her laugh ."
"she was supposed to be making dinner and settling down for the evening but she chuckled at their antics , not wanting to slow them down by bringing them inside when they were having so much fun ."
"what mother would n't want to keep these little tykes in her life ?"
"knowing they would be famished after all this activity , she pulled herself together and looked around in her pantry to figure out what to make for dinner ."
"she got out the pasta and whipped up their favorite meal of macaroni and cheese for dinner , adding in hot dogs which they loved , even if they did n't know the hot dogs were actually made out of tofu ."
"when it was finished , she called them inside and told them to go wash their hands ."
"when they were all cleaned up , they each climbed into their chairs and looked at the meal ."
"`` mac and cheese ?"
"what 's the special occasion ? ''"
"sam asked , already looking into the casserole dish to smell the cheddar cheese ."
"`` you know , billy gets the mac and cheese in the box but this is much better , '' he declared and jumped out of his chair to give her a hug ."
"siri accepted the hug with relish , then picked him up and plopped him back down into his chair ."
"`` let 's say grace , '' she admonished before sam could grab the handle of the spoon to serve himself ."
"the warning was twofold ."
"she wanted them to be grateful for their food , but she also knew that his little hand would dig the spoon in deep , and there was the strong possibility that he would fling some of the casserole onto the wall behind him ."
"experience had taught her well ."
"both boys bowed their heads while siri gave thanks , then they licked their lips as she took the serving spoon and ladled the mac and cheese onto their plates ."
"`` real hot dogs ? ''"
"sam asked ."
"`` do they look real ? ''"
"she questioned right back at them , surprised that they were asking ."
"they continuously surprised her about what they 'd figured out ."
"jacob laughed and shook his head ."
"`` not real , '' he declared ."
"sam nodded his head and popped one into his mouth ."
"`` tofu dogs , '' he claimed ."
"`` we get real hot dogs at school . ''"
"siri did n't correct him that they only served turkey hot dogs at school ."
"what they did n't know , would n't hurt them ."
"she kept checking her cell phone for messages , wondering if she 'd missed the call from malik ."
"in the past , she had n't bothered him unless she knew he was on his way to her ."
"so she was n't sure what time lapse was normal when she needed him to call her back ."
"bath time passed by , their teeth brushed , their cute little bodies tucked into fleece pajamas and both of them snuggled into their beds in the room right across from hers ."
"and still no word from malik ."
"it was relatively early in the evening , only eight o'clock , but she 'd called him two hours ago ."
"surely he 'd gotten the message by now ."
"a small part of her hoped that the phone he had used earlier in the day to call her was n't really his ."
"that it was just a throw away that he used sometimes when he needed a phone ."
"that would let her off the hook and she could keep her boys all to herself , guilt free ."
"the dishes were finally done , the cozy kitchen cleaned up and her family room all straightened out by the time she sat down and pulled her work bag towards her ."
"she was propped up on her overstuffed chair , and it occurred to her that this was almost the same position she was in when malik had walked into her apartment four years ago ."
"her tiny little cottage style house was bigger , but not by much ."
"the family room contained barely enough space for her sofa and two chairs , but this furniture was of much better quality than what she 'd had back then ."
"and this time around , she had a wall separating the kitchen from her family room , which was extremely nice ."
"it was funny how things changed , and yet they still remained excruciatingly familiar ."
"chapter 4 she was concentrating on reconciling the current inventory with the recent shipments when a hard , loud knock sounded on her front door ."
"she looked up with worried eyes and noticed that it was only eight thirty , but she could n't imagine who would be at her door even at this time of the night ."
"her neighbors were wonderful , but they also knew that her boys went to sleep early at night , and they would definitely call before stopping by for any reason ."
"she peered warily through the security peep hole and her nervous breath caught in her throat ."
"standing on her front stoop , looking exceptionally gorgeous , was malik in a pair of perfectly pressed , casual slacks and a sexy , leather jacket ."
"with a deep breath , she opened the door slowly , wishing she could just ignore him completely and keep her children to herself ."
"do the right thing , she told herself sternly ."
"`` i thought you would call me back , '' she said in lieu of a greeting as she leaned against her front door as if it could somehow protect her from the impact this man continued to have on her ."
"an impact she resented now and wished she could banish from her life ."
"he put a hand to her door and gently pressed the door open wider ."
"once he was inside , he closed the door himself , looking at her with desire in his eyes ."
"`` i did n't want to wait ."
"i got your message and came over . ''"
"she quickly retreated behind one of the large chairs , a new defense that she also realized was weak as he came closer and she could smell his subtle , spicy aftershave ."
"`` how did you know where i lived ? ''"
"she asked nervously , wishing her voice was stronger ."
"but he was looking at her as if he wanted to ... .well , taste her , she thought as she watched his eyes look at her trembling mouth ."
"he moved slowly around the chair , never taking his eyes from his prey as he relentlessly stalked her ."
"`` same resources that found your cell phone earlier . ''"
"she stepped back and shook her head ."
"`` i really do n't like those resources . ''"
"he stepped closer , his tall body crowding her and she stepped back , wanting space from the heat emanating from his body ."
"`` they 're good resources . ''"
"`` they 're nosy resources that have invaded my privacy , '' she said but this came out as a whisper ."
"her eyes moved over him , noting his strong jaw , shoulders that were impossibly broad and muscled and a chest that tapered to slim hips and long , powerful legs ."
"`` you 're beautiful , '' he said and this time he was less than an inch from her ."
"his hand came up , a finger gently caressing her cheek ."
"`` i 'm going t kiss you . ''"
"`` please do n't , '' she croaked out ."
"she tried to turn her head , but his finger stopped her , somehow holding her still while his head slowly , ever so slowly descended towards hers ."
"`` i do n't think i can stop myself , '' he replied and covered her mouth with his ."
"she gasped and his tongue took full advantage of the possibility , moving inside , tasting her , teasing her to participate in the kiss ."
"she tried for all of two seconds to resist ."
"but those feelings that had been there four years ago were actually more powerful now ."
"he was more powerful , his ability to lure her in complete ."
"she wished she were stronger , and then she did n't wish for anything except having his arms around her , his body pressing against hers the way he used to do for her ."
"she wanted him too desperately for anything intelligent to contradict ."
"with a moan , she wrapped her arms around his neck , her hands gripping his shoulders to pull him closer to her ."
"he quickly complied , his hands moving from her head down her body , skimming against her back and her waist to reacquaint himself with her once again ."
"and she loved it , reveled in his touch and his scent and the way he felt against her ."
"it had been four years since any man had touched her like this and , truth be told , he was the only one who had ever tempted her to want this ."
"he lifted her up and pressed her against him , his hands taking control but siri needed no prompting ."
"her legs automatically wrapped around his waist and she pressed against him , wishing their clothing was n't in the way ."
"next thing she knew , she was falling but his arms were still securely holding her ."
"when she felt the mattress underneath her back , she almost sighed with relief , but that 's when he lifted himself up slightly and pulled her sweater over her head , his heated gaze looking at her with the red , lace bra ."
"she held her breath , praying that he would n't just look but she should n't have worried because his hand smoothed up her stomach , cupping her right breast in his long , strong fingers , his thumb rubbing the already taut nipple and making her body flinch with the need to feel him , her legs pulling him closer and her arms reaching for him as well ."
"she pushed the jacket off his shoulders , then started working on the buttons of his shirt , but she could n't make them open fast enough ."
"in the end , he stood up and unbuttoned the top two buttons , then simply pulled the dress shirt over his head , tossing it behind him before coming back ."
"he took her hand and pressed her palm against his stomach and siri did n't need any other invitation ."
"her fingers had always loved to touch him , to feel his heated skin underneath her fingertips ."
"he inhaled sharply when her fingers moved lower , running along the top edge of his slacks , slipping underneath before coming back out and working on his belt buckle ."
"he grabbed both of her hands , pulling them out to the sides as he bent to take her nipple in his mouth , sucking hard before gentling , then circling the hard peak with his tongue ."
"`` take it off , '' she gasped , begging him with both the words and her body to move the bra out of the way ."
"she did n't want anything between his tongue and her breast , needing all of him like she 'd never needed anyone else ."
"`` with pleasure , '' he said with a husky laugh and his hands quickly unlatched the snap and pulled off the red lace , tossing it behind him before bringing his head back down to suckle her again , pulling her nipple into his mouth until she cried out for relief ."
"`` is this all you are going to do ? ''"
"she asked , taunting him with words since he was still holding her hands out to the sides ."
"she could n't move and could n't make him go faster ."
"she was trapped and wanted him inside her so desperately she was writhing on the bed , her legs rubbing against his side in an attempt to push him over the edge so he would take her , make her whole like he 'd done in the past ."
"he looked down at her and she could see that he was working hard to restrain himself , to go slower for her ."
"she shook her head ."
"`` take your time later , '' she begged , licking her lips in desperate need ."
"he watched her and tried for control , but when she arched against him , pressing herself against his erection and showing him that she was ready for him , he did n't want to hold back ."
"`` please malik , i 'm already begging ! ''"
"he tried for a moment longer , but when she pressed against him again , he cursed under his breath and stood up , releasing her hands and stepping back so he could take off his slacks ."
"siri did n't hesitate either ."
"she sat up and slid her own slacks off , too far gone by this point for any sort of common sense to enter into the scene ."
"she needed him , he was here and he wanted her ."
"those were the only things she understood ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he groaned when he came back to her , pressing her back against the mattress and pulling her legs back against his waist ."
"he reached down , his fingers seeking the soft folds and finding her more than ready for him ."
"`` i 've missed you so much ! ''"
"he said a moment before he pushed himself into her , pulling one of her legs over his shoulder so he could go deeper , press her harder ."
"as he moved inside her , siri reveled in how wonderful it felt , how whole and perfect he felt ."
"she hated the fact but she 'd never wanted this from any other man ."
"and then he sped up and her thoughts flew out the window ."
"she desperately needed ... .she reached up and held on , knowing that he 'd never let her down and arched into his thrusts ."
"just when she did n't think she could take anymore , he reached down , his fingers pressing against her and she splintered outward , every cell in her body exploding with pleasure so intense she was n't sure if she cried out or simply cried ."
"she just hung onto his strong body , her whole self becoming a part of him in those moments ."
"it took a long time , but finally she was able to open her eyes and look around ."
"what she saw made her blush and wish she could pull back ."
"but malik had never allowed her any shyness before and he had n't changed in the past four years ."
"`` do n't do that , '' he said softly , his head dipping down to nibble along her shoulder ."
"`` do what ? ''"
"she asked , trying to pull out from underneath him but he was n't having any of that ."
"he simply shifted his weight to the side and pulled her next to him ."
"`` you know exactly what , '' he replied and moved lower ."
"`` i 'll be back , '' he said and pulled himself away from her , moving to the bathroom ."
"she heard the water running and tried to pull the blanket from the bottom of the bed over her , but he was too fast ."
"he was already striding back to the bed before she had a chance to even unfold the soft material ."
"`` i told you not to do that , '' he said with a chuckle and whipped the fabric out of her reach ."
"`` you mentioned something earlier about going slower , '' he said as his head dipped down ."
"siri knew he was going to kiss her and she turned her face to the side to avoid that ."
"she had to stop him , they had to talk but when denied her mouth , he simply took whatever was available ."
"at that moment , it happened to be her breast which was already sensitive from his previous lovemaking ."
"when he touched her , she almost sat up in the bed because the feeling was so intense ."
"he chuckled and moved to the other breast , giving it the same attention ."
"`` you 're not getting away from me , siri ."
"i 'm going to enjoy it this time . ''"
"she tried to move out from underneath him , but at the same time , bringing his head down for more attention ."
"`` are you saying you did n't enjoy the last go around ? ''"
"she was n't going to take this laying down , she thought ."
"just as much as he 'd learned about her body , she had been taught what he liked ."
"and she fought the intensity of his touch the only way she knew how ; by giving as good as she got ."
"her fingers slid down his back , moving back up and then down the front of his chest ."
"he lifted himself a bit higher so she could have better access and siri took advantage of that ."
"her hands moved down his chest , switching from light , fluttery movements to a more firm touch that told him she meant business ."
"it was a random path her hands made , until she reached her goal ."
"as her fingers moved downward , she smiled as she grasped him and heard his sharp intake of breath ."
"he looked down and watched as her hands smoothed , explored ."
"when she pressed against him , even the lightest pressure and he was on his back and she smiled ."
"this was payback time , she thought as her mouth followed the same path her fingers had just traveled while her hands continued to caress his erection , reacquainting herself with his size and length ."
"she loved the satiny feel of him , the amazing texture and musky , male scent as she kissed and tasted his ridged stomach muscles ."
"as she moved lower , she could feel his body tense in anticipation and she almost laughed , joyous at the power she had over him at this moment ."
"she continued to kiss him , her body moving against his legs and she felt his hands in her hair , his fingers massaging her scalp and his whole body went almost rigid with expectation when her mouth hovered over him , not moving , teasing him with her warm breath ."
"when she finally took him in her mouth , she was thrilled with his groan of pleasure ."
"her mouth covered him , taking as much of him as she could ."
"she moved against him , her tongue teasing as she pleasured him the best way she knew ."
"he only gave her a few moments of that before he sat up , picked her up and literally lifted her over him so she was flat on her back ."
"`` two can play at that game , '' he growled before he nibbled his way down her body ."
"his large chest was in the way so she had no defense when his hot mouth covered her core ."
"he was n't as tentative as she was either ."
"he knew what he was about and was relentless as he played her body like a violin , listening to her gasps and moans , feeling the tension in her muscles but not letting her have the release she needed ."
"each time she came close , he 'd bring her down , then ramp her up again until she was begging him once again ."
"siri could n't believe how well he could control her , how intense he could make her feel ."
"`` please , '' she cried out , her fingers in his hair and her body arched against his mouth in a desperate attempt to find the release ."
"`` you 're so beautiful , '' he said before he flicked his tongue , his fingers moving against her and letting her climax while he watched with fascination ."
"when she relaxed against the mattress once again , he lifted himself up , looking down at her and she glared back ."
"`` you did that on purpose ! ''"
"she sighed , trying to be angry , but not sure she had the energy to get to that emotion ."
"`` yes ."
"i did ."
"and i 'm going to do it again , '' he said with a low , powerful tone of voice ."
"siri shook her head , not sure she could handle another wave like the previous two ."
"`` malik , please , no ... '' she started to say then he slid into her warmth and she sighed with how good he felt , how stretched and full she felt now ."
"and how ready she was , once again , to experience this man 's magic ."
"as he moved inside her , she found that she was more than ready to take all of him , to ride the intense wave of pleasure ."
"her body was so primed , so ready she could barely even think or breathe as he took her higher , faster , pounding into her and not giving in until she cried out with her climax ."
"he followed moments later , holding her close as he too experienced the same feelings ."
"a long time later , he slid out of her and went to the bathroom once again to clean up ."
"as she watched him go , she felt both cherished and respected that he 'd had the foresight to use protection ."
"in this case , she had n't been prepared and was sincerely grateful that he had been ."
"which raised the question of why he was so prepared , she thought as she rolled to her side , pulling the blanket over herself ."
"this time he allowed it and she marveled at how sexy he looked when he came out of the bathroom ."
"he leaned against the door frame , looking at her in the bed and she shivered , knowing that he was thinking about round three ."
"that man did n't really slow down , she knew from experience ."
"even when she thought her body was completely sated and there was no way he could get her going again , a touch or a look and she was once again primed and ready for him ."
"`` i need a drink of water , '' siri said , her voice hoarse and her body not able to move easily ."
"`` i 'll get you something , '' he said and pushed away from the wall ."
"but she stopped him with a touch to his bare shoulder ."
"`` you do n't know where anything is , '' she said and slipped out of the bed , pulling her robe over her before she stood up and belted it closed ."
"`` if you think that 's going to stop me when you come back , you need to re-evaluate your methods , '' he said and walked to stand in front of her , his hands resting on her slender hips , already moving up and down against the soft fabric of her robe ."
"`` malik , about what just happened ... we ca n't do this , '' she said awkwardly , wanting to step away from him but he just smelled so good ."
"she knew she was sending mixed messaged which was n't fair ."
"he laughed softly and shook his head ."
"`` siri , we just did 'this ' ."
"and we 're going to do it again and again . ''"
"`` no , '' she said and pushed her hair behind her ear ."
"`` we ca n't ."
"i need to ... '' `` i know what you said on the message ."
"that you needed to talk ."
"but it seems as if we have trouble talking right now ."
"why do n't you go get some water and we 'll try to talk a bit later . ''"
"`` no , we need to talk outside of the bedroom ."
"now ."
"i mentioned on the message that i needed to tell you something important . ''"
"he chuckled and shook his head ."
"`` siri , right now , i 'm honestly having trouble letting you leave just to get a glass of water ."
"do you truly think that not having a bed in our vicinity is going to keep my hands off of you ? ''"
"he paused and sighed , shaking his head as he said , `` you 're even more beautiful now than you were four years ago ."
"there 's something about you that 's more alluring , more ... '' he looked her up and down , his dark eyes taking in her larger breasts , her hips that were rounder , sexier ."
"`` i do n't really know what it is , but i ca n't get enough of you . ''"
"she stepped back and opened the bedroom door ."
"`` i 'll be back , '' she said , her mind frantically trying to figure out how to tell him about jacob and samuel , needing to give him the news but each time she tried , he changed the subject ."
"`` we really have to talk , malik ."
"this was a mistake , you have to leave . ''"
"she tried to be firm , but could n't look at him while she said the words ."
"he was reaching for his slacks as he shook his head ."
"`` it was n't a mistake , siri ."
"i can explain what happened four years ago ."
"just go get your water and we 'll talk . ''"
"siri sighed because he was n't moving quickly to get dressed or meet her in another room ."
"he should have looked ridiculous standing there in her bedroom with all the flowers and delicate items , but the decor only showed off how truly masculine he was ."
"he was so confident in that masculinity that the flowers did n't even bother him ."
"she doubted he preferred the decor , but it did n't make him cringe ."
"she 'd give him points for that , she thought as she walked out of her bedroom ."
"she did n't really need water , although she went into her small kitchen and reached for a large glass in the cabinet anyway ."
"she really just needed some space to try and figure out how to tell malik about his sons , to find the right words that would give him the news without creating any hurt or resentment ."
"siri leaned against the counter , staring into the darkness outside her window ."
"how should she start off the conversation ?"
"she could n't just come out and say it ."
"this was something that probably needed a bit of an explanation ."
"but if she explained , then he might explain why he 'd left her that weekend to marry the other woman ."
"she really did n't want to hear his explanations ."
"she could n't imagine any reason she 'd like that would excuse that kind of a betrayal ."
"now that she thought about it , maybe it was n't such a big deal ."
"he 'd gone off and married a woman that was more appropriate to his station in life ."
"a woman that was probably politically connected and therefore more suitable ."
"the man had an image to uphold and she had no illusions about her appearance ."
"she was just an ordinary working woman and at , the time , she had n't even finished school ."
"the woman he 'd married had been beautiful and confident , poised and sophisticated ."
"she had probably been a much bigger help to his rule than she could ever be ."
"four years ago , she had been emotionally invested in the relationship , but obviously malik had thought she was just a weekend fling , the kind of woman who was available whenever he was with no strings attached ."
"siri had been the only part of the relationship that had n't understood the rules ."
"that thought hurt and she turned around , her mind spinning with the possibilities of how to tell him her news and none of them were a good start to how she was to explain that malik had two wonderful , intelligent sons ."
"with a sigh , she shook her head and bit her lip in frustration ."
"she was procrastinating and she needed to get back there to her bedroom , tell him to get dressed and bring him back out to the living room where she could have a conversation with him without the distraction of her bed ."
"siri opened the fridge and ... .screamed at the top of her lungs !"
"in the darkness , all she saw were little things jumping out ."
"everywhere !"
"blobs were jumping from the top shelf of the fridge , the bottom shelf , seemed to be crawling out of the drawers and on the condiment jars ."
"one of the blobs jumped towards her and she screamed again , unsure of what was going on and trying to figure it out in her sex and nighttime muddled brain ."
"when one of the blobs came closer , she jumped up onto the kitchen table and pulled her feet up , screeching as the jumping things , which now looked like larger and faster blobs , were bouncing and crawling all over her kitchen floor ."
"she was just about to scream again when the overhead light flipped on and her body was picked up and slammed between malik 's hard , muscular back and the wall of her kitchen ."
"adding to the chaos , jacob in his red fleece pajamas and sam in his blue ones , came rushing out to the kitchen , their curly hair messed up and their tiny little eyes blinking in the bright light of the kitchen ."
"`` do n't hurt them ! ''"
"sam screamed and immediately bent down to protect his treasures , which siri now realized were dozens of little frogs , all of whom , she suspected , had been stored in her fridge in the shoe box that was laying open on the top shelf ."
"her only two clues were the fact that she never , ever kept shoe boxes in her fridge and she could n't fathom any reason to poke holes in a shoe box , except if one , or two little boys , wanted to keep something alive in said shoe box ."
"she relaxed for all of two seconds before the adrenaline that had been coursing through her body reacted to the release of the fear ."
"`` samuel martin !"
"are you telling me that you stored your frogs in my refrigerator ? ''"
"she pushed malik out of the way and came to stand in front of him , hands on her hips as she glared down at her son who was carefully scooping up his frogs and gently putting them back into the shoe box he 'd had them in previously ."
"jacob came to his brother 's defense , but he was also delighted by the middle of the night spectacle ."
"`` they like the cold , momma ."
"they were too warm outside so i had to do something . ''"
"`` please explain to me why you thought my fridge was the something that you came up with . ''"
"unfortunately , jacob was no longer looking at all the frogs jumping around ."
"he was entranced by the sight behind her and , adorable , brave little guy that he was , he knew there was an imminent threat to his precious mother and he was determined to rise to her rescue ."
"`` do n't hurt my momma ! ''"
"he yelled out , adding a whole new dimension to the chaos ."
"his chubby little hands were fisted at his sides and he was in obvious fighting mode with a clear line of sight to malik ."
"`` jacob , '' she started to say , only to turn around and glance at malik ."
"all she saw was a completely naked man with a knife in his hand , staring at two little boys with a stunned expression on his face ."
"`` do n't just stand there , malik , go put some clothes on ! ''"
"he looked down at her , then back at the boys , then down at himself ."
"something must have gotten through because he looked back at the boys and nodded curtly before moving off to the bedroom ."
"while bending down to try and catch the disgusting , jumping blobs , she glanced up at her son , trying to figure out why he was n't bending down to help ."
"instead , he was glaring at the door where the strange man had disappeared , obviously trying to figure out why the stranger had gone into his mother 's room ."
"`` jacob , stop it !"
"you 're not going to fight that man so stop acting belligerent and help me catch these horrible creatures , '' she commanded in as gentle a voice as possible under the circumstances ."
"jacob did n't obey , but instead followed malik with his eyes , glaring daggers at the naked man who , in his mind , was a threat to his mother , the only security he knew in his little world ."
"when malik was gone , jacob put his arm around siri 's shoulders and patted her back ."
"`` it 's okay , momma ."
"he 's gone now . ''"
"siri would have laughed at how cute her little man was , how proud he was to have protected his mother , but she was still frantically trying to get the frogs back into the box ."
"they really had n't enjoyed being in the box which had been in the cold fridge and now they were not cooperating when she and sam tried to get them back into their 'jail ' ."
"nor would she , siri thought ."
"she would n't like being put back into the fridge , so she 'd be trying to pop out of any box that might go back into cold storage too ."
"`` jacob , please help me , '' she groaned as she picked up yet another one and dumped it into the box ."
"`` not like that momma ."
"you have to be gentle , '' sam explained as he carefully caught one and put it in the box ."
"unfortunately , the spry little devil just shot back up again ."
"malik reappeared , dressed in his slacks and shirt once again ."
"with efficient hands , he picked up several that were escaping into her living room , and captured three more in his path to the box ."
"he then dumped them all inside and covered it while he found the others ."
"`` is that all there is ? ''"
"he asked , looking sternly at sam ."
"sam looked up at the big man and nodded , his mouth hanging open as he realized that someone was in his kitchen that might not be as nice as his mother ."
"with a sigh of relief , siri picked up the box , careful not to drop it even though the disgusting things were still popping around ."
"`` sam , these are going outside and i do n't ever want to see any kind of creature in my fridge , ever again ."
"do you understand ? ''"
"`` but momma , they needed ... '' she immediately sliced the air with her hand , cutting off any explanation he might have ."
"this was a non-negotiable issue in her mind ."
"`` no !"
"the fridge is not to keep anything cool other than food ."
"no excuses and no getting around that rule . ''"
"he sighed , realizing the no-getting-around-mom tone of voice ."
"`` yes , momma . ''"
"`` and jacob , stop glaring ."
"it 's almost midnight ."
"both of you need to get back into bed . ''"
"`` is he leaving ? ''"
"jacob asked , still glaring at malik despite siri 's admonition for him to stop ."
"`` yes ."
"but he and i have some things to talk about ."
"the sooner both of you are in bed and asleep , the sooner he will leave . ''"
"she shuffled both of them off to their room , tucked them in and gave each of them a soft kiss ."
"`` go to sleep , '' she ordered gently ."
"since they 'd never been up this late , she was n't sure if they were too wound up to fall back to sleep , or if they would fall to sleep immediately now that things were quiet once again ."
"she turned and found malik standing in the doorway , his arms crossed over his chest as he looked down at the boys in their identical toddler beds ."
"without a word , she followed him out to her living room ."
"`` would you give me just a moment to pull on some clothes ? ''"
"she asked softly ."
"chapter 5 malik could only nod and he watched with rising fury as she walked down the hallway , closing the door behind her ."
"as if that would stop him , he thought ."
"he could n't believe that she 'd kept something like this from him ."
"she had children ?"
"she 'd loved another man ?"
"he was n't sure about the age of those little boys , but they had to be about three or four years old ."
"so she 'd met someone almost immediately after he 'd left ."
"she had n't waited around very long , had she ?"
"had he been wrong about their relationship ?"
"he would have sworn that she 'd loved him all those years ago but maybe he 'd only been hoping that were the case ."
"she 'd obviously moved on after he 'd left ."
"and to think , for four years , he 'd felt guilty about the way things had ended , had tried hard to contact her again in order to explain things and try to make her understand why he 'd married his ex-wife ."
"when she came back out , he was pacing the tiny expanse of her living room , so beside himself with rage that he was actually ready to kick the furniture out of his way to make more room ."
"she watched him carefully for a moment , realizing he was angrier than she 'd ever seen him ."
"`` so now you know , '' she said and sat down on the chair , her hands on her knees as she braced for the questions ."
"`` how long ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"siri was n't sure what he was asking ."
"`` how long before they were born ? ''"
"`` yes , fine !"
"that 's as good a start as anything else . ''"
"`` they were born march twelfth , just over three years ago . ''"
"he quickly did the math and almost exploded ."
"`` so were you with someone while you were with me ? ''"
"he asked , bending down and leaning over her so she had to push back against the cushions ."
"she looked up at him , confused ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"`` yes !"
"you should excuse yourself !"
"how dare you be with some other man while you and i were ... '' `` some other man ? ''"
"she interrupted , her temper starting to increase as she absorbed the accusation he was tossing at her ."
"`` malik , are you saying that i cheated on you with someone else ? ''"
"she pushed him back by his shoulders , standing up and glaring right back at him ."
"`` are you going to say that you waited until after i left ?"
"how long ?"
"maybe a week ?"
"if that ?"
"those boys are too young for you to have had much time in between me and the next guy you slept with . ''"
"she gasped ."
"`` how dare you ! ''"
"she poked him in the stomach , wanting to hit him but trying to be nice despite the disgusting accusations he was making ."
"`` i 've never been with any other man but you , but now i 'm wondering why i even bothered ."
"how could you even think something like that about me ? ''"
"`` because ... '' he gestured behind him to where the boys were sleeping ."
"and then he hesitated ."
"she was spitting mad and waited for the information to sink in ."
"`` exactly ! ''"
"she snapped when the realization dawned on him that those were his sons asleep in the other room ."
"she noticed the tension in his shoulders fall off and his whole body almost drooped into the chair behind him with the understanding that he was their father ."
"she tried to bank her temper now that he was getting a better understanding of the situation , but it was hard ."
"this was just another slap in the face after all she 'd gone through previously with , and without , this man ."
"`` those are your sons in that room , the same ones who were about to fight you in my kitchen . ''"
"he seemed breathless and all the anger was gone ."
"he shook his head , trying to wrap his mind around the news ."
"`` i did n't know ... '' `` of course you did n't know ."
"because you rejected my letter when i tried to tell you , '' she said and reached behind her to the large desk filled with all her important papers ."
"she pulled out the well worn envelope , still sealed with the postmark date and the `` return to sender '' stamped on the outside ."
"malik looked down at the envelope , then back up at her ."
"when his fingers moved to unseal the envelope , siri 's stomach twisted with the memory of what she 'd written ."
"there had been no emotion left which would have enabled her to give him any details other than the pertinent ones like a due date , the schedule and any additional information the doctor had provided to her ."
"the opening words had been simple , `` i 'm pregnant with our child ."
"if you 'd like to be a part of this child 's life , please contact me through our lawyers . ''"
"and then she 'd given the name of her father 's attorney and his contact information ."
"a simple signature , no greeting or salutation , a few facts about the pregnancy and that was it ."
"she 'd been too sick , both physically and emotionally to write anything else ."
"when the letter had been returned , the attorney had advised that she store it in a safe place , for just such a moment like this ."
"`` i did n't get this , '' he said ."
"glancing at the date , he shook his head ."
"`` they never would have sent this to me ."
"not during this time period ."
"things in duban were ... .chaotic . ''"
"she did n't care about his minions and how they 'd harmed her and her life ."
"in response , she crossed her arms over her chest and watched him , waiting for his next move ."
"`` that 's what you wanted to talk about tonight , '' he said and shifted uncomfortably on the sofa , his hands still holding the letter and envelope as he absorbed all of the news ."
"`` yes ."
"i wanted to talk . ''"
"he smiled and shook his head ."
"`` okay , so we 're talking . ''"
"siri took a seat as well and curled her legs underneath her ."
"trying to be fair , she considered the situation from his perspective and knew that she might have jumped to the same conclusion ."
"it was yet another reason they should n't become intimate since their trust in each other was completely destroyed ."
"`` they 're really wonderful boys , '' she said softly ."
"the anger was gone now , and all that was left was her joy in her sons ."
"`` they are painfully smart , well ahead of their class in school . ''"
"`` what are their names ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` jacob and samuel ."
"i picked those names because they sounded strong and tough ."
"i did n't want anyone messing with my kids . ''"
"he nodded and looked at the wall , seeing their baby pictures framed and hung with pride ."
"`` what were they like as babies ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she told him about their birth and what they were like , described their personalities and their accomplishments ."
"malik continued to listen , asking questions and only pausing for a moment to make a terse phone call ."
"it must have been to his driver who was outside her house waiting because he spoke rapidly in arabic , then snapped the phone shut , turning back to her for more questions ."
"for the next several hours , malik asked questions and she answered them , not holding anything back as she talked about her favorite subject ."
"she told him funny stories about their antics , pulled out their baby books and showed him photos ."
"they sat on the sofa together and she caught him up on their sons ' lives ."
"she did n't know when it happened , but at some point , she fell asleep ."
"she woke up the next morning with jacob and sam playing `` softly '' beside her bed ."
"they were trying to be quiet , but each one was building something with legos , and it was a little hard to be quiet when arguing about who got which piece of the legos set ."
"`` mom 's awake , '' jacob whispered to sam ."
"`` yes ."
"i 'm awake , '' she replied , pushing her hair out of her eyes and looking for malik ."
"`` he 's gone , momma ."
"he left a note . ''"
"sam picked up the piece of paper beside him and handed it to her , all without looking away from his legos bridge which he was trying to figure out how to make longer without making it taller as well ."
"`` it says he 'll be back with breakfast . ''"
"siri looked at the note and read the words ."
"simple and to the point ."
"`` i 'll be back with breakfast ."
"m. '' she looked down at her son , eyebrows raised and her head spinning with both fatigue and surprise ."
"`` sam , did you read this note ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"he pulled his concentration away from the bridge and looked up at his mother with a confused expression ."
"`` was i not supposed to ? ''"
"siri shook her head , dumbfounded that her three year old son was reading already ."
"`` when did you learn your letters ? ''"
"he looked back down at his bridge , shrugging his shoulders ."
"`` we figured those out last month , momma , '' jacob replied ."
"`` ms. tennley kept spelling things and it was irritating ."
"so we decided to figure out what she was spelling . ''"
"jacob looked up from his building , his eyes puzzled ."
"`` what does 'incessant ' mean ? ''"
"he asked ."
"siri laughed and shook her head ."
"`` never ending , '' she explained ."
"`` i 'm guessing that you were asking her questions , huh ? ''"
"he shrugged and went back to his building ."
"`` sam asked more , '' he replied in his defense but he did n't seem overly concerned about being curious and asking multiple questions ."
"siri rested her head in her hand for a moment , overawed once again by their intelligence ."
"`` i 'm going to shower ."
"can you two behave while i get dressed ? ''"
"`` yes , but what 's for breakfast ?"
"and are n't we going to be late for school ? ''"
"siri glanced at her clock and sighed ."
"`` i think we need to skip school today , '' she said and picked up the phone to let their school know they would n't be in today ."
"she suspected that malik would want to spend some time with them and she did n't blame him ."
"as she walked into the bathroom , she told herself that she was n't jealous of her sons ' day ahead ."
"she did n't want to spend time with malik , she needed to get some work done and he was off limits to her anyway ."
"as she showered , she felt her whole body tingle with awareness ."
"she 'd always felt this way when she knew that malik was going to be back and she shook her head , refusing to become excited , both emotionally and physically , just because the guy was coming to see their sons ."
"she had to be firm , to stay away from him and not fall back into his arms ."
"if she just kept herself an arm 's length away , she should be safe ."
"she added a bit more makeup , telling herself it was only because she looked so tired and was n't because she wanted to impress malik ."
"he was nothing but the father to her sons and if she wanted to keep her children here with her , and not in some foreign country , she had to be firm ."
"no charm , no kissing , no making love ever again ."
"she walked out to the kitchen , needing coffee pretty desperately at this point ."
"she looked out the window as she filled up the coffee pot with water , intending to make double what she would normally brew since malik would probably need some as well ."
"as she looked at her yard , her mind wondered where those frogs had hopped off to during the night ."
"she laughed softly , thinking about sam 's expression when he saw all of his little treasures hopping around the kitchen and his sad little face when she put them outside instead of 'safely ' back in the fridge ."
"something to the right caught her eye and she focused her attention ."
"when she did n't see anything again , she relaxed and assumed she was just seeing things because she was so tired ."
"then she caught another movement , this time on the opposite side of her fence ."
"was it a cat ?"
"no , that was definitely too large to be a cat !"
"as she watched , she saw a man standing on the corner of her yard ."
"picking up the phone , she scrambled to find the on button , frantically trying to call the police ."
"someone was in her back yard and they were n't from this neighborhood ."
"she knew all the neighbors and large men with dark suits were not neighborly !"
"the doorbell rang at the same time she found the on button but she ran to the door , thinking that maybe it was malik and he was in danger ."
"sure enough , as soon as she peered through the peep hole , she saw him standing there ."
"she whipped open the door and grabbed him by the middle of his shirt , then slammed the door shut behind him , leaning against it as she tried to dial , but her fingers were shaking so badly she could n't find the numbers ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"malik demanded , putting a hand to her phone and stopping her fingers ."
"`` someone ... ! ''"
"she tried to speak but she was too terrified ."
"`` out back ! ''"
"she tried to push his hand away but he stopped her by grabbing her wrists ."
"`` are you telling me that there 's someone in the back yard ? ''"
"he clarified ."
"she nodded frantically ."
"`` yes ."
"two men , i think ."
"they 're big ."
"i do n't know them ."
"we need to call the police . ''"
"he was already shaking his head before she finished her statement , putting a reassuring hand over her own that were trying to dial the phone ."
"`` relax , siri ."
"those are my body guards ."
"or at least part of the team . ''"
"`` why are they in my back yard ? ''"
"she gasped ."
"`` you were n't here !"
"they should be with you ! ''"
"he was already shaking his head ."
"`` siri , as soon as i realized that my sons were in this house , i had my team split up and surround the house ."
"they 've been here all night long ."
"you heard me make the call last night . ''"
"she stopped trying to press the buttons and looked up at him ."
"`` security ?"
"body guards ? ''"
"she looked around , trying to understand what he was telling her but the meaning of his words escaped her ."
"`` but why are they here ? ''"
"he tried to be reassuring , but firm ."
"having his children guarded was a non-negotiable issue ."
"and he would n't allow her to be in danger either ."
"she was going to be his wife , she just did n't know it yet ."
"`` yes ."
"it 's necessary ."
"the boys ca n't be without body guards ever again ."
"nor can you , actually . ''"
"she stood there , staring at him for a long moment ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"she really did n't like where her thoughts were leading her at his statement ."
"he raised an eyebrow ."
"`` one of them will be my heir , siri ."
"you had to know that this would happen . ''"
"she was shaking her head and backing up ."
"`` no , '' she whispered ."
"`` you ca n't do that to them ! ''"
"`` it 's the natural order of things , '' he said , trying to calm her down ."
"she backed up , forgetting about the cell phone in her hands when he was telling her that one of her sons would be his heir while the other would be left behind , superfluous unless the first born died ."
"the possibility was horrible and divisive to her children ."
"they were great friends and raising them in this way would tear that bond apart ."
"`` then stop the order !"
"change it ! ''"
"she did n't even want them being rulers , much less one of them being malik 's heir ."
"she 'd known it was a possibility , but now with the reality of the future being shoved down her throat , she did n't like it one little bit ."
"`` i ca n't ."
"they 're my sons ."
"they 'll need to come back to duban and learn to rule the country ."
"my people will demand it . ''"
"`` then tell them no !"
"they are n't going anywhere . ''"
"she stepped back , refusing the reassurance of his arms ."
"`` if you 're in charge , then make them find someone else to rule when you 're ... . ''"
"she could n't say 'dead ' or 'gone ' or anything else that might force her to face this man 's mortality ."
"he sighed and bowed his head , then raised it once again to look directly at her ."
"`` we 'll also have to marry . ''"
"she gasped and stepped backwards ."
"`` marry ?"
"you ? ''"
"`` of course ."
"you 're the mother of my children ."
"we have to marry . ''"
"he said it like the marriage was a foregone conclusion ."
"in her mind , it was far from her future ."
"not even a remote possibility !"
"`` you married some other woman ! ''"
"she looked him up and down with disgust and frustration ."
"`` not only that , you married her days after ... ..sleeping with me !"
"i wo n't marry you now . ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` you 're tired from last night and probably not thinking clearly ."
"i should n't have kept you up talking so long but let 's just put this issue aside until we can think more clearly about this ."
"okay ? ''"
"siri pulled herself together ."
"`` you can talk all you want ."
"but you 're not taking my sons from me . ''"
"`` they 're my sons as well , '' he countered ."
"`` and you apparently have their whole future planned out for them ."
"well , one at least ."
"the other we can toss to the side , '' she said angrily and stormed into her kitchen , pressing the button to make the coffee ."
"`` oh , no ! ''"
"she interjected after a moment 's pause ."
"`` we ca n't toss him out , can we ?"
"an heir and a spare , is n't that the phrase ? ''"
"`` do n't be ridiculous ."
"i do n't consider either of them in that way and you know it . ''"
"`` momma , what 's a spare ? ''"
"sam asked as he climbed up into his chair , looking at malik as if he were an esteemed stranger ."
"he 'd helped with his frogs so in sam 's opinion , the tall man could n't be all bad , the toddler surmised ."
"jacob was right behind him and both looked up at her with curiosity , waiting for a response ."
"siri sighed and shook her head ."
"`` we were just arguing about politics , honey ."
"are you hungry ? ''"
"she asked and took the large , expensive looking bag that malik had brought in with him and set it on the counter while they calmed down from their argument ."
"the smells emanating from the bag were actually making her mouth water and she realized she was incredibly hungry ."
"she refused to attribute her hunger to having sex with malik the night before though ."
"she would n't give him credit for anything !"
"except turning her life upside down again !"
"malik turned back to the boys , his eyes hungrily watching each of them and siri instantly knew what he was trying to do ."
"`` this is jacob , '' she explained , pointing to her little guy on the right ."
"`` you can tell him by the little freckles here on his ear , '' she said and tickled jacob behind his ear , smiling when he giggled and tried to stop her by lifting his shoulder ."
"`` and this is samuel , '' she said , moving to the other side of the table ."
"`` you can tell him apart by the wiggle in his nose , '' she teased , `` and by the darker eyes ."
"he has slightly darker hair as well . ''"
"turning to malik she said , `` they 're fraternal twins but they 're so alike that they are almost identical ."
"and they already like tricking people who ca n't tell them apart as well ."
"right boys ? ''"
"she asked and winked at them as they grinned up at her ."
"`` guys , '' she said , pulling their attention away from the bags in front of them , `` remember how i told you that your daddy was a very busy man ? ''"
"when she received a nod from both , she went on , `` well , he 's really sorry and he 's here now . ''"
"she turned to malik and took a deep breath ."
"`` this is your father , guys . ''"
"the boys did n't react at all ."
"they continued to stare up at him , their blank faces not really showing anything at all ."
"siri glanced at malik , who was staring right back at them , with an identical expression on his face as well ."
"`` so ? ''"
"she said , just to break the silence ."
"`` are you guys okay with us sharing our lives with your dad ?"
"he 's come an awfully long way just to meet you . ''"
"sam was the first to speak ."
"`` momma says we ca n't go around naked . ''"
"he turned to malik as if seeking confirmation ."
"`` but you were naked last night ."
"does that mean you 'll let me go naked too ? ''"
"of all the things she 'd thought they might say when they first met their father , siri could honestly say that question was the absolute last thing she would have guessed that he would ask ."
"her mouth fell open and she stared , wondering what the best way to answer her son was under this situation ."
"malik , bless his heart , spoke up and gave the answer that made her heart melt just a little bit towards him ."
"`` if your mom says that we ca n't go around naked , then we ca n't do that . ''"
"sam 's crestfallen face only lasted for a moment before he perked up and thought up his next question ."
"`` are you going to come to school with us today ?"
"momma always comes to school and gives us a hug and a kiss before we can go play ."
"she makes us , '' he replied with a grimace on his cute little face ."
"siri bent over his head and gave him a big , loud smooch ."
"`` and do n't you forget it ! ''"
"she said and tickled his tummy ."
"`` but we 're not going to school today ."
"you 're going to spend some time with your dad . ''"
"she looked up and glanced at malik , then pulled her eyes quickly away , afraid of the way he was looking at her right now ."
"she could n't tell if he was admiring the way she treated the boys , or if he was just amused by her teasing ."
"`` what did you bring for breakfast ? ''"
"she asked , trying to distract him ."
"he continued looking down at her for a moment , then he pushed himself away from the counter and picked up the bags ."
"`` i actually have no idea ."
"i told the chef to make something for kids and adults . ''"
"siri grimaced and peered into the bags ."
"`` what do you think , guys ?"
"do we trust him ?"
"he 's not used to being a dad ."
"he might have really gone off the mark here . ''"
"she almost laughed when they both looked into the bag , bumping their heads in their eagerness to find out what was inside ."
"malik chuckled and carefully took the bag away , pulling out several boxes with an elaborate label on the front ."
"`` let 's see how badly i did on my first try . ''"
"he opened one box and raised his eyebrows , then handed it to siri ."
"`` this is probably for you . ''"
"he pulled out another one and looked at the contents and smiled slightly ."
"`` i think this is probably a good meal for a cute kid , '' he said and glanced at sam and jacob , both eager with wide eyes , the anticipation making their little bodies wiggle in excitement ."
"he handed the box to jacob who took it with a distracted `` thank you ! ''"
"before he peered inside ."
"`` cool ! ''"
"he exclaimed and grinned over at sam who was leaning as far over the table as possible so he could see inside the box ."
"`` its pancakes in the shape of different kinds of animals ! ''"
"he exclaimed ."
"sam looked up at malik , his eyes pleading for something just as interesting ."
"malik pulled out the next box and peered inside ."
"`` yep , this is another one for a kid , '' he said and handed the box to sam ."
"`` awesome ! ''"
"sam said as he happily clapped his hands over his own box of animal shaped pancakes ."
"the last box he kept for himself , not even bothering to look inside as he turned to siri , winking at her amused expression as her sons dug into the pancakes without even bothering to wait for the syrup ."
"`` they 're made of tofu and i think the chef even put a bit of flax seed in them , '' malik whispered in her ear , then nibbled slightly , sending shivers throughout her whole body ."
"she jumped and almost lost her own box which contained a perfectly cooked omelet with gooey cheese and lots of grilled vegetables ."
"`` by the way , we 're not through with that original discussion from last night , '' he said and sat down at the table between the boys , but not before he chuckled over the blush that pinkened her cheeks ."
"the three males sat at the table , her sons asking malik questions about where he was from , what it was like in duban , why he lived there instead of here , would they ever be able to visit duban and would the people there like them if they came ."
"the questions were amazing and she could n't believe how much knowledge her sons had acquired about desert life and the various parts of the world ."
"when they 'd eaten all they could of their pancake animals , the three of them wandered outside and malik introduced them to the body guards , explaining what they were doing and how they should always be in sight of their guards ."
"this was an area siri had n't anticipated , and was n't really ready for ."
"but since he had n't spoken to her about it before , she was n't sure how she could deal with it ."
"she 'd been alone with her boys for so long , making all the decisions , never having to consult with anyone , this was a new area for her ."
"it occurred to her that malik had given her a huge compliment ."
"he was accepting these two boys as his own with only her word that they were his offspring ."
"she knew others in his country would need a dna test to prove paternity , but malik had just accepted her word ."
"malik took the boys to the playground down the street and they were both eager to show him all the things they could do ."
"she followed , watching in amazement as they played and talked with their new father , getting to know him and finding out everything they could about him ."
"they had simple sandwiches for lunch and malik continued to answer their questions , but siri could tell that the boys were winding down ."
"normally , they were okay for about an hour after their lunch , but because they had n't slept well last night due to the frog debacle , they were more fatigued that usual ."
"a part of her wanted to keep them awake , using them as a buffer against being along with malik , but since their eyes were slowly closing as they sat at the table , trying hard to finish their lunch , siri knew that she needed to put them down for their afternoon nap ."
"malik carried jacob while siri pulled sam up out of his chair and followed behind ."
"they laid the boys down on their beds and siri pulled a blanket up over each of them , kissing them and lowering the room 's blinds to dim the bright , afternoon sunshine that was streaming through the bedroom windows ."
"chapter 6 she found malik back out in the living room , looking at their pictures on the wall once again ."
"`` they 're great kids , siri ."
"you 've done an amazing job with them . ''"
"she sat down on the sofa , her heart racing in fear of what he was going to say next ."
"`` thank you '' , she whispered ."
"`` marry me , '' he said when he turned around to look at her ."
"siri jumped and looked up at him ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"`` i want to marry you . ''"
"she was already shaking her head ."
"`` no . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` because ... . ''"
"she shook her head and looked away ."
"discussions of marriage definitely had n't been in her plan for the day ."
"in fact , marriage to malik had been banished from her imagination when he 'd married that other woman ."
"`` malik , this fatherhood thing is all new to you and i sincerely understand that you need an heir , but let 's not jump into a relationship that wo n't work ."
"there 's time to figure out how to deal with the kids and their future ."
"you 've known about the boys for less than a day . ''"
"`` and now that i know about them , they need to be raised in duban . ''"
"she swung around , hearing the words she 'd been expecting and fearing ."
"`` no ."
"they need to be raised right here ."
"in their home where they can have a normal life . ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` siri , that 's just not possible ."
"they 're princes . ''"
"that declaration startled her and she did n't want to acknowledge the truth of that ."
"`` they are little boys who like building things and exploring their world , discovering new animals and seeing what mischief they can create . ''"
"he shook his head , refusing to let her stick her head in the sand when it came to their heritage ."
"`` they are royal princes who will have responsibilities ."
"some they will like and others they wo n't like . ''"
"`` and i wo n't let you determine their future when they are only three years old . ''"
"`` their futures were determined at conception , siri ."
"and regardless of what you want , they need to be raised in the palace where they can be kept safe ."
"it does n't matter if you like it or not , i have enemies that will try to harm them ."
"they are n't safe here ."
"this house alone is too small to protect them adequately . ''"
"she crossed her arms over her chest , facing him with defiance and frustration ."
"`` i 'm not leaving here , '' she stated emphatically ."
"he sighed and took a step closer , obviously striving for patience in the face of her rejection ."
"`` how about if we compromise initially ?"
"let me get them into a more secure house , one that can be guarded better , with a perimeter that is n't bordering on four other peoples ' homes ."
"the neighbors here are going to start getting suspicious when they see armed guards ... '' her eyes widened and she looked outside , trying to see through the bushes to find the men in her yard ."
"`` those men are armed ? ''"
"she interrupted , horrified at the idea of guns or weapons being near her sons ."
"`` we ca n't have guns in the house , malik ! ''"
"malik refrained from rolling his eyes , but just barely ."
"`` of course they are armed , siri ."
"they ca n't stop bad guys from stealing our kids with a bb gun . ''"
"siri curled her arms around herself , staring at the pictures on the wall of her tiny little guys ."
"`` ignore the idea of the weapons siri ."
"if we can get the boys out of this small house , you wo n't see the guns or any of the other weapons ."
"after you drop off the boys at school tomorrow , we can take a look at houses in the area ."
"you can decide on whichever house suits your needs the best ."
"i wo n't try and influence you at all ."
"once my guards survey the possibilities , they 'll let us know the options so the final decision will all be yours . ''"
"she thought about that for a moment ."
"she could at least go through the motions , could n't she ?"
"and at least tomorrow she 'd be with a realtor , someone who could ease the tension between her and malik ."
"with the boys sleeping , she really could use a break from being alone with him right about now ."
"even arguing with him was wearing her down and she was already exhausted so he was really getting to her ."
"she gave in without much grace ."
"she was still resentful of even having to compromise and it seemed as if malik was getting his way once again ."
"she could n't come up with an alternative that would keep her boys safe though ."
"`` fine ."
"i drop the kids off normally about nine o'clock ."
"i do n't need to get into the office early and i make my own hours . ''"
"he smiled , his admiration for her business acumen coming through with his gaze ."
"`` it 's nice being the boss , '' he said , his voice husky and deep ."
"he leaned forward , invading her space a bit more ."
"`` i 'm really proud of your success , siri ."
"i looked into your company and you 've created a great idea with the educational toys ."
"you have an impressive marketing strategy too . ''"
"she wished his praise did n't matter ."
"but hearing him say something like that , it made her heart flutter ."
"`` i had to be successful ."
"i had those two guys to look after , '' she said , nodding in the general direction of jacob and sam 's still quiet bedroom ."
"`` you could have worked for another company ."
"you did n't need to take the risk of starting off on your own ."
"i always thought there was something special about you . ''"
"if she was so special , why had he married someone else ?"
"why had n't she been special enough for him four years ago ?"
"those questions rose up to choke her and she turned away from him ."
"`` well , it all worked out in the end , did n't it ? ''"
"there was a long silence and she refused to turn around and look at him to determine what he was thinking or feeling ."
"`` what 's wrong , siri ? ''"
"`` nothing ."
"do n't you have some work to do ?"
"the boys wo n't be awake for another hour ."
"you can go do ... whatever it is that you do . ''"
"he did n't respond immediately and she wondered if she 'd hurt his feelings ."
"but that was ridiculous ."
"malik did n't have feelings to hurt ."
"he was superman with a palace to prove it ."
"`` will you let me take all of you out for dinner ? ''"
"he asked behind her ."
"she could almost feel the heat of his body as he stepped closer to her ."
"she wanted so badly to just lean back and feel his strength against her , for him to wrap his arms around her and hold her close , to tell her that he had n't wanted to marry that other woman ."
"that she was the only one he 'd ever cared about ."
"she did n't even hope that he loved her , just that she had meant something to him ."
"something other than simply a convenient lay when he was in town ."
"but he had married another woman ."
"he 'd married her only days after holding her in his arms and making love to her until she cried out with her pleasure ."
"she 'd needed his touch so much back then and it had been pure hell learning to live without that feeling after his betrayal ."
"she could n't do that again ."
"she had to be strong and hold firm about not becoming physical with him ."
"okay , not being physical with him again ."
"she could n't let last night happen again ."
"`` yes ."
"that would be nice ."
"the boys would love a dinner night out . ''"
"`` will you be more comfortable in a specific restaurant ? ''"
"she shrugged her shoulders and looked away ."
"`` anything will be fine , '' she stated ."
"anything that would keep her from being alone with him , she thought ."
"`` i 'll pick you guys up at six o'clock then ? ''"
"`` i 'd better meet you somewhere because i have the car seats set up in my car . ''"
"`` fine ."
"i 'll meet you back here at six o'clock then . ''"
"he walked to the door and put his hand to the knob ."
"`` thank you for today , '' he said before he strode out of her house ."
"she watched through the front window as he walked to the limousine , his guards falling in around him as soon as he stepped outside of the house ."
"she was amazed that she 'd never seen that before , but now that she thought about it , they had n't ventured out very often after the first few dates ."
"she 'd met him at his place , or they 'd travel somewhere to be alone ."
"it had been a very isolated relationship ."
"chapter 7 siri was nervous about a dinner out with malik but not because she was afraid she would be alone with him ."
"she was more anxious about bringing her boys to dinner ."
"she was n't sure he knew how little boys behaved out in public ."
"and if they had to wait for their dinner ?"
"it would be all over ."
"malik was used to fancy dinners , expensive restaurants , five star chefs with a multi-course meal ."
"her boys were already hungry by the time he arrived on her doorstep to pick them up , even though she 'd given them a snack only a half hour ago ."
"`` where are we going ? ''"
"jacob asked as they climbed into their car seats that had been installed in the limousine ."
"samuel strapped himself in , but his toddler hands were n't quite up to the task of snapping the clasp of the unfamiliar buckle ."
"`` i hope it has something good ."
"momma always takes us to blue bird , '' he quipped , referring to the family friendly restaurant that served great burgers and corn dogs , not exactly the healthiest meal , but it was a fun night out and they only went there occasionally ."
"`` how about jungle jim 's for dinner ? ''"
"he asked and was rewarded by dual shriek 's of delight and excitement ."
"siri breathed a sigh of relief , then blushed when he caught her ."
"she had to look away when he raised one eyebrow , as if to say , `` did you doubt me ? ''"
"which she had and she 'd been caught ."
"the car seats were facing backwards which left the entire forward facing seat for her and malik ."
"she was glad actually , because that allowed her to make sure there was enough room separating her from malik on the drive , and she pushed herself all the way over to the opposite side , daring him to sit closer ."
"thankfully , he respected her need for space and did n't push it , but even having two feet of space between them seemed too close ."
"the drive to the restaurant was short and the boys were eager to get out and see all the crazy animals inside ."
"the restaurant really was an incredible spectacle , with trees and parrots that would reply to the kids , even if the response did n't make much sense ."
"there was also a large fish tank against one wall and malik had arranged for their table to be right in the middle of that wall ."
"the boys were enthralled to be that close to the fish and sharks and eagerly pointed to the various species swimming around ."
"siri let the boys have the chairs that looked straight onto the fish tank , which meant that she and malik were sitting next to each other on the opposite side ."
"normally , that was n't a problem , but with him so close , he even put his arm across the back of her chair ."
"she tried leaning forward , but her back grew tired since she slouched most of the time while working ."
"the waitress quickly arrived and took their orders ."
"because there was so much to look at with the fish floating by , it was the easiest dinner out she 'd ever had ."
"the food even arrived quickly , although siri was n't sure if the boys realized what they were eating since their eyes were watching the fish in front of them instead of on their plates ."
"`` when you get to be older , i 'll take both of you snorkeling and scuba diving . ''"
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"jacob asked ."
"`` it 's when you get to swim in the ocean and the fish swim right by you ."
"it feels like you can reach out and touch them , but you really should n't touch anything underwater ."
"your hands might have something on them that could harm you ."
"besides , some of them might bite you back , '' he explained with a wink ."
"their eyes grew round with the wonder of that kind of possibility ."
"`` do they swim ? ''"
"he asked softly , watching siri pick at her salad ."
"she nodded and put her fork down , too tense to eat anything with him leaning close and almost whispering in her ear ."
"`` i 've had them in lessons last winter so they are familiar with water ."
"they are n't afraid of anything that i know of yet . ''"
"he laughed softly and leaned closer ."
"`` unlike you , right ? ''"
"she pulled away and looked up at him ."
"`` i 'm not afraid of the water , '' she replied ."
"`` no , but you 're afraid of me , are n't you ? ''"
"`` no !"
"why would you say that ? ''"
"she demanded and pushed her hair behind her ear , picking up her fork and forcing herself to take a bite despite the fact that her stomach was fluttering wildly ."
"`` or maybe you 're afraid of what i make you feel ."
"interesting question either way , in my opinion . ''"
"she shifted away from him slightly , wishing she could stop blushing ."
"`` you think too much of yourself , malik . ''"
"`` do i ?"
"so if i were to do this , '' he said and let his hand drop to her back , his fingers sliding against the muscles lightly , `` it would n't bother you ? ''"
"he asked ."
"his fingers touched a spot on her back that he knew always drove her crazy ."
"it was like an erogenous zone outside of the norm and she hated that he remembered how much she loved to be caressed on her back ."
"`` do n't do that ! ''"
"she snapped and sat up straight again ."
"`` why ? ''"
"`` because we 're not doing that ! ''"
"`` ah , but we are , siri ."
"we 're going to be doing this , and so much more ! ''"
"siri 's stomach coiled into knots with his promise and she shuddered at the images that immediately popped into her mind ."
"she did n't want to feel like this !"
"she wanted to be immune to him , to be able to keep her distance but her whole body wanted to lean into his touch , to move her chair closer to his body and find warmth and comfort , as well as the excitement he always provided whenever he touched her ."
"damn him !"
"she wanted her old life back before he re-entered her world and turned it upside down !"
"the evening progressed much easier after that ."
"the only awkward moment was after she 'd tucked the boys into bed , she was alone with malik in the dimly lit hallway ."
"`` thank you for dinner , '' she said nervously and moved back into her family room , turning on as many lights as possible to break the intimate feeling of the now quiet house ."
"`` you 're welcome , '' he replied and pulled her into his arms ."
"he kissed her thoroughly , but just when she was shivering with need , he stepped back and released her ."
"`` can you take the day off again tomorrow ?"
"we need to look at some things together . ''"
"she nodded her head , her hand shaking as she lifted it to her tingling mouth , trying to subtly wipe away the effect he had on her system when he kissed her ."
"`` fine ."
"yes ."
"tomorrow , '' she said , hoping this meant he was leaving ."
"he walked to the door and laid his hand on the doorknob ."
"`` we 're not finished , siri ."
"this is just the beginning . ''"
"she was shaking her head , trying to deny it but he was already out the door before she could say anything to contradict his words as she sat alone in her little family room , she sank down into the sofa and curled up , staring at nothing as her mind frantically tried to figure out what to do about this whole situation ."
"but the emotional stress of the last few days finally caught up with her ."
"she tried , but failed to keep her eyes open and work out a solution ."
"as midnight approached , she was fast asleep on her sofa , still curled up and her dreams taking her to the place where she would n't allow herself to go while awake ; directly into malik 's arms and making love to him until they were both too tired to move ."
"chapter 8 `` okay , so where are we going ?"
"what was the big surprise today that we could n't talk about around the boys ? ''"
"siri asked as she walked out of the preschool area ."
"she hid her eyes behind sunglasses , worried that he might see something she did n't want him to know ."
"he was too perceptive of her moods lately ."
"he stood less than a foot from her and looked down into her face , knowing that she was concerned about what was going to happen to her happy little family life ."
"he would n't do it if it were n't so important ."
"but the next step had to be done ."
"`` i have several houses lined up for us to walk through . ''"
"`` why would we look at houses ? ''"
"`` we discussed this a few nights ago , but you did n't want to accept it ."
"but siri , you have to understand that samuel and jacob can never be just normal boys ."
"i need them to be in a secure environment ."
"i ca n't let anything happen to them . ''"
"siri took a deep breath and stood still for a moment ."
"she had to think about this rationally , and do what was best for the boys and not what she wanted to maintain ."
"besides , she was really just maintaining her little cottage out of sentimental reasons ."
"she 'd hate it there if anything happened to the boys ."
"`` okay ."
"let 's take a look . ''"
"malik relaxed with her acceptance , had actually been prepared for a longer argument over any possible move ."
"but thankfully she was being reasonable ."
"he just hoped she 'd continue to think that way as she walked through the houses his security team had already approved ."
"he had a plan but knew he 'd have to take it slow ."
"this little woman was skittish and did n't trust him ."
"if he were in her place , he would n't trust him either but now it was time to toss all that behind them and move forward ."
"`` excellent ."
"thank you for this . ''"
"he pushed away from the limousine and opened the car door for her ."
"the driver had already taken the car seats out and stored them somewhere else so there was plenty of room in the back now ."
"as they drove through unfamiliar streets , malik had to take a phone call which was fine with her ."
"she did n't know what to talk to him about ."
"she felt like she was with a stranger , and the mention yesterday that her sons were actually princes was still a huge shock ."
"they pulled up to an extremely large house with palladian windows , a gate with a security guard standing out front and several other security measures she was stunned to see in place ."
"it made her wonder what other measures were around that she was n't aware of ."
"`` where 's the realtor ? ''"
"siri asked as malik led her into the house , not even needing a key to open the door ."
"`` and should n't we knock before entering someone else 's house ?"
"or are they expecting us ? ''"
"malik chuckled and put a hand to the small of her back ."
"`` this house has been vacant for about six months ."
"the previous tenant died suddenly and the children live on the west coast ."
"they 've been trying to sell it ever since their father died . ''"
"`` ah ."
"so it 's a bargain , huh ? ''"
"she asked tentatively , warily looking up at the ornately decorated pink marble foyer with gold painted statues and a grand staircase that wound around the circular room to a landing at the top complete with black balustrades and more gold statues ."
"even the ceiling was decorated ala michelangelo style celestial type of art , but siri was n't sure if the painting was actually a work of art or a ... .well , she could n't really describe it and she blushed as she pulled her eyes away ."
"`` i guess you could say that , '' he replied softly , smothering the chuckle at her not so subtle reaction to the not-so-subtle sexual images on the ceiling ."
"`` what do you think ? ''"
"as if he did n't know already , he thought ."
"siri 's poker face , at least in this case , was non-existent ."
"she bit her lip and looked upwards again , needing another look at the ceiling to make sure she had n't imagined the scene ."
"`` it 's a very ... nice house , '' she replied carefully ."
"in reality , she hated it ."
"every little detail and golden covered cherub was a disgusting show of pompous wealth and she could n't imagine living in a place like this ."
"it was beyond pretentious and bordering on obscene both in the blatant wealth and the decorations that seemed somehow seedy and creepy in a sexual way ."
"`` let 's look around a bit more , '' he said , already able to tell that she did n't want to live here ."
"`` remember , we can always redecorate . ''"
"`` do you like this house ? ''"
"she asked , worried that he really did like the feel and the decor ."
"she remembered his penthouse from four years ago and had a hard time reconciling his previous taste to the interior of this house ."
"that place had been decorated with strong , masculine colors like tans and browns or grey and black , but they were still elegant and refined ."
"this was just ... .tacky and pretentious ."
"he shook his head as he surveyed the cheap bureau masquerading as a louis xiv marble topped hallway table ."
"it was n't hard to detect the poor workmanship and the chips already broken out of the white marble ."
"`` i wo n't be the one redecorating ."
"feel free to hire a decorator to make the house the way you want it to be in any style that suits you and the boys . ''"
"she looked around , actually depressed that he 'd brought her to a place like this ."
"it was so completely outside of her tastes that it seemed like a complete waste of their time ."
"`` i ca n't afford a decorator , '' she replied , angry that he was being so casual about moving them out of their current home and into a hollowed out bordello ."
"he took her elbow gently and navigated them through the foyer and into the office , which seemed much more normal with the heavy wooden desk and large , leather chair ."
"the books on the shelves were well worn , but dusty , indicating that the previous owner had n't used them often ."
"he looked around , amused that some of the shelves actually had fake books , as in wooden pieces cut out to look like a row of books complete with gilded edges ."
"`` you wo n't have to worry about money from now on , siri ."
"i will be taking care of you and the boys . ''"
"`` i can take care of them well enough ! ''"
"she snapped back ."
"she knew she was just being defensive now because malik 's wealth was so far out of her league she could n't even begin to imagine his net worth , much less how she could afford to pay for the security malik considered necessary ."
"he thought about contradicting her , knowing that the boys would need private tutors as well as many different kinds of instructors ."
"he planned to have the boys taught how to ride horses , teach them combat training , economics , politics , languages ... anything that would help them survive in the world they were going to be thrown into ."
"being ruler came with the perks of wealth , but ruling was also a huge pain in the ass !"
"as they walked into the living room together , siri stopped at the entryway , stunned by what she was seeing in the room ."
"`` oh my , '' she replied softly ."
"`` that 's quite an understatement , '' malik replied with a cough of surprise ."
"siri tried very hard , but staring at a nude painting of a man who was , to put it kindly , rotund , while angels danced above his head just caught siri 's sense of humor and would n't release it ."
"it started off as a snort in place of a chuckle , but as she looked to the right , she found another nude , of the same man !"
"`` do you think it 's the previous owner ? ''"
"she asked and covered her mouth to stifle her laughter ."
"`` hmmm ... i 'm guessing it 's a strong possibility , '' he said as he looked to the left ."
"siri followed his gaze and gasped in horror at the painting of the same man , with the same physique , but the angels were no longer angels but had transformed into fairies ."
"all of whom were kissing the man in various parts of his body ."
"`` i hope this home was n't offered fully furnished , '' siri finally got out but she could n't control her laughter any longer ."
"the hilarity was just too much and she was bent over laughing as she looked at the three portraits of the man in the buff ."
"`` he really thinks something big of himself , '' she replied , all anger and frustration of the previous moment dissipated with the views from the horrific living room ."
"both of them walked rapidly out of the house , siri laughing uproariously while malik was able to maintain a bit more decorum and was only chuckling at the paintings ."
"they did n't even bother going through the rest of the house , just too amazed by that front room to even bother ."
"`` okay , on to the next , '' malik declared , nodding to his guards who immediately moved into position , startling siri as she entered the limousine ."
"malik said something to the security guard , who looked stunned initially , then shook his head and opened the door to the car , all the while maintaining his perimeter search of the area ."
"`` what did you say to him ? ''"
"she asked as they were seated in the vehicle ."
"malik shook his head slightly , an amused expression on his face ."
"`` i told him the house looked like a fat man 's bordello . ''"
"she could n't smother the laughter at his comment and since they were now out of the house , she did n't even try ."
"`` i loved the pink marble ."
"do you think that was to make the ladies more comfortable ?"
"or to add a bit of romance to his day ? ''"
"malik chuckled ."
"`` i 'd hate to see that man trying to be romantic . ''"
"it felt good to laugh with malik , siri thought as they traveled down the road , heading to the next house he wanted her to see ."
"the past several days had been so filled with tension and trying to avoid being caught alone with him , the absence of tension , even if it was only momentary , was extremely nice ."
"she sat back against the soft leather seats with a smile on her face as she watched the countryside pass by ."
"`` you have n't done that since i arrived , '' malik said softly ."
"she spun her head around , looking up at him ."
"`` done what ? ''"
"she asked , her stomach muscles instantly tensing as her awareness of him came right back ."
"she wanted to scoot away , to put just a few more precious inches between their bodies , but she did n't want him to know that she was aware of him ."
"she was trying to pretend she was indifferent to him , that she was over the attraction she 'd had in the past ."
"unfortunately , as he looked down at her , his heat seeping into her arm and leg , she did n't think he was buying her act ."
"she watched as his eyes dilated and she thought he moved slightly closer , but was n't sure and did n't want to test it ."
"`` what are you talking about ? ''"
"she asked , trying to sound more confident and unaffected than she was ."
"`` you have n't smiled ."
"except when jacob or samuel does something like put frogs in your fridge . ''"
"she had to laugh at the memory now that she was n't surrounded by scary , jumping blobs ."
"`` you were trying to protect me that night , were n't you ? ''"
"she asked , chuckling at the memory now that it was in the past ."
"`` all i heard was your scream ."
"i had no idea what the threat was . ''"
"a giggle escaped her and she covered her mouth with her hand ."
"`` so you ran out naked , slammed me up against the wall ."
"where on earth had you stored that knife ? ''"
"she asked through her laughter ."
"`` i always carry a knife ."
"who knows when i have to protect a damsel in distress ? ''"
"`` from frogs , '' she finished and the laughter just could n't be stopped ."
"she let it roll and was actually holding her stomach when the laughter finally subsided ."
"`` oh my !"
"could you imagine if that scene had been recorded ?"
"all those frogs jumping around , my kids trying to protect me from you who are ten times their size and you standing there naked with a knife ."
"what a chaotic mess ! ''"
"`` it was cute , '' he replied and leaned back but the smile on his face told her that he 'd found the memory just as humorous ."
"`` i 'm impressed that both boys are so protective ."
"of you and the frogs although samuel might need to rethink his priorities ."
"it shows they will both be good leaders . ''"
"that reminder sobered her instantly and she looked away , pretending to watch the trees pass by outside the car but in her mind , she was scared for her boys ."
"for what might be in their future ."
"`` promise me that they 'll be okay . ''"
"malik took her hand in his and gave her a reassuring squeeze ."
"`` we 'll work this out together ."
"i 'll teach them how to survive and they 'll thrive ."
"trust me , '' he replied ."
"siri shivered and could n't look up at him ."
"trust was the problem , she thought ."
"she did n't trust him ."
"she had at one point and he 'd broken that trust ."
"she did n't want to even try to trust him again for fear of being hurt ."
"luckily , the driver pulled into another driveway at that point , relieving her of needing to reply ."
"the next house was better , but had no furniture in it ."
"the lines were more elegant , less ornate and much more to siri 's liking ."
"it was still much bigger than she would prefer ."
"and much too empty ."
"as they walked through the house , she tried to step away from malik because each time he touched her , she wanted more ."
"she wanted him to pull her into his arms and kiss her but she had to remain firm in maintaining her distance ."
"`` why is n't a realtor here to help walk us through the houses ? ''"
"she asked after he touched her back to lead her through one of the rooms ."
"`` the realtor made all the arrangements with the owners but she went ahead ."
"i wanted to view the houses with you alone instead of being bothered by a chatty woman trying to sell us something that we did n't like . ''"
"siri nodded her head , but was nervous about being in a house without anyone else to distract them ."
"she would much prefer a chatty lady who would at least be a diversion ."
"`` this is nice , '' she replied , pretending to look around , but there were just very large rooms with large windows and no curtains ."
"the carpets were cream , the walls white , the foyer a white marble ."
"the kitchen had white cabinets and tan , granite countertops with top of the line appliances ."
"`` this is large . ''"
"`` and white , '' malik said out loud ."
"siri nodded , and tried to step away from him , needing a bit of space ."
"she moved around the counter , just to breathe a little bit of non-malik scented air ."
"she remembered that scent , remembered how much she 'd loved it ."
"she 'd always breathed in his cologne as soon as he 'd pulled her into his arms after a long absence and she 'd just close her eyes and savored the feeling of having his muscular arms wrapped around her , his scent filling her senses and the anticipation of him taking her into his bedroom and making love for the rest of the night ."
"she was older now ."
"she could n't just fall into bed with this man ."
"thankfully , there were n't any beds in the house !"
"a fact which should make her feel better , but the total absence of anything made her much more nervous ."
"her imagination was doing things , like wondering what it would be like if malik simply picked her up and placed her on the kitchen counter ."
"they 'd never made love in the kitchen ."
"she was n't even sure if his previous penthouse had a kitchen since it was entirely possible that he ordered in from whatever restaurant sprang to mind ."
"there had always been food delivered , but where it had come from , she had no idea ."
"`` let 's look around upstairs , '' he said , his voice deep , becoming husky ."
"was he feeling the same thing she was ?"
"she wondered what she would do if she needed to get away from him ."
"would he stop if she said no ?"
"she was being ridiculously silly ."
"of course he would !"
"malik was n't the kind of guy who would rape a woman ."
"he was kind and gentle ."
"a liar , but still very gentle ."
"he 'd never hurt her before ."
"it was really her own reaction that she should be concerned about ."
"he would stop if she told him no , but when had she ever been able to tell him no ?"
"once he took her into his arms , she was n't capable of saying anything ."
"well , there were a few things but siri did n't think `` faster '' or `` please '' would keep her safe from his lovemaking ."
"she walked up the stairs , painfully self conscious that he was s right behind her ."
"she actually thought about putting her hands behind her , just to block his view of her derriere ."
"she did n't want him thinking about the past and how he 'd bent her over his bed , entering her from behind with his hands on her bottom ."
"the feeling had been incredible from that angle and she could feel her body heating up just from that memory ."
"`` let 's look at the smaller rooms first , '' he suggested , his voice echoing in the silence of the house , the sound vibrating off the walls and coming out stronger ."
"there was nothing to absorb the sound so any noise traveled without hindrance , making her cringe at the sound ."
"`` that 's fine , '' she replied and turned to the left instead of the right ."
"she definitely did n't mind his suggestion , not wanting to enter the owner 's suite alone with him ."
"not that she would be sleeping in there anyway ."
"not with him at least ."
"she looked in the first room , a large , airy room with hardwood floors and more white walls but the windows would let in a lot of sunlight ."
"`` this would be nice for the boys , '' she said , trying to find anything to say to ease the awkwardness of the silence ."
"`` they would love to have the hardwood floors to race their cars along ."
"although they might scratch the surface ."
"they play pretty hard lately and they 're going to get worse as they get older and stronger . ''"
"she knew she was rambling and tried to stop herself , but she was just too nervous ."
"`` i would n't worry about that , '' he replied , leaning against the door jamb , watching her flutter from closet to closet , then inspecting the bathroom ."
"she even looked in the cabinets and he almost chuckled at her nervousness ."
"his body was already reacting to her cute bottom sticking up in the air and the charming blush creeping over her soft skin ."
"the blush told him that she was feeling exactly the same way he was , but wishing it were otherwise ."
"he wanted her , no doubt about it , but he wanted all of her ."
"and soon , he 'd get her ."
"he wanted her in his bed , in his home and pregnant with more of his children ."
"this time , he wanted to see her body swell with his child , her breasts enlarge with the milk that would nourish the babe ."
"he thought she was sexy now , he could n't imagine how incredible she would look once they started having more children ."
"he wanted to grow old with her and share more memories together ."
"he 'd have that , he just needed to convince her of his commitment ."
"`` let 's keep on going , '' he said , needing some sort of distraction to keep himself from thinking about wrapping his arms around her and feeling her softness press against him ."
"`` okay , '' siri replied and followed him down the hallway ."
"she peered into the other rooms , not very interested since , if they chose this house , they would n't really use these bedrooms for anything ."
"she really had no idea why he wanted such a large house anyway ."
"except for the yard , she supposed as she glanced outside one of the bare windows ."
"there really was a great deal of land surrounding this house ."
"she had no idea that there were even houses like this so close to the city with so much land but she supposed that , if one had the money , they could buy anything ."
"`` is there a reason we need eight bedrooms ?"
"we 'll only be using three of them , wo n't we ? ''"
"malik looked down at her ."
"`` the boys will be in the same bedroom , wo n't they ? ''"
"she focused all of her attention on the laundry area , pretending to be fascinated by all the cabinets in that area ."
"`` yes , of course ."
"it 's a good idea to have the laundry facilities on the same floor with the bedrooms ."
"it will be easier to get the clothes where they need to go . ''"
"she did n't really care where the washer and dryer were right at this point ."
"all she cared about was ensuring that malik understood that she would not be sharing his bed ."
"they were walking into the owner 's suite when he spun her around ."
"`` do n't even think that you and i are n't going to share a bedroom , siri ! ''"
"he declared , his strong hands holding her wrists , pulling her close enough that she could smell his subtle aftershave ."
"`` we are n't going to share a room , malik ."
"we are n't sleeping together again . ''"
"he could n't help it when she spoke like that ."
"she 'd thrown down a challenge and he was n't one to just let something like that pass by him ."
"he 'd always been competitive , but having her say something like that was the equivalent to waving a red flag in front of a raging bull ."
"`` you think so ? '"
"he asked , his voice soft and his body already aroused , not just by her challenge but by being with her all day ."
"malik 's voice was gentle , but she could sense the rising anger ."
"`` malik , let 's be sensible about this , '' she said , trying to placate him ."
"`` we 're not meant for each other ."
"we tried four years ago and you chose someone else ."
"if we were right for each other , then ... '' `` you 'd do n't know all the details about four years ago ."
"do n't make declarations on only half the knowledge , '' he commanded , leaning forward ."
"`` but even more important , you ca n't claim you do n't want me , siri . ''"
"she frantically shook her head , praying she could push him away if he came any closer ."
"but already , her palms were itching to touch him , to feel him ."
"`` i do n't ."
"you have to accept that ! ''"
"she said , frustrated that she sounded so breathless and weak ."
"she pressed her hands against the wall just to make sure she did n't reach out and do something stupid , like touch him ."
"she was becoming weaker by the moment as he came closer to her , his heat warming her body and filling up her senses ."
"she wanted this man , but she had to fight this attraction ."
"she 'd gone through the hurt and betrayal once before , she could n't do it again ."
"`` why do i find your denials not ringing true ? ''"
"he asked rhetorically ."
"he pulled her closer ."
"`` i think you 're lying to both of us , siri . ''"
"`` i 'm not , '' she whispered , her eyes dropping to his mouth , watching with frustration and anticipation as it came closer ."
"her mind told her to pull back , to show him with actions what she was saying with her words ."
"but her body , so desperate for his touch , ignored her brain once again ."
"why she was so weak where this man was concerned was beyond her , but she could n't seem to pull away ."
"and then his mouth touched hers and she did n't want to pull away any longer ."
"she wanted to press herself against him , to feel his body 's reaction and revel in the power she had over this man ."
"`` do n't do this again , '' she pleaded , begging him to have the willpower that she could n't seem to muster ."
"`` i must , '' was his only response before he covered her mouth with his own ."
"he wanted her so badly and she was here , willing and soft and warm and lovely ."
"he wanted her like he 'd never wanted any other woman , was anticipating her body 's welcoming heat like a drug addict needed the next fix ."
"when his hands traveled from her arms up to her shoulders and pulled her closer , she shivered in his arms and that was all the declaration of her submission he needed ."
"he wanted her , she wanted him and they were alone ."
"he pulled her hard against him and when her arms wrapped around his neck , his own hands dropped to her waist , sliding down to her adorable bottom that he 'd wanted to touch so badly while walking up the stairs moments ago ."
"she 'd been taunting him with her walk and she did n't even know it ."
"he pulled her closer , needing her complete surrender and when he got it , he lowered her onto the carpet , his hands slipping under her clothing to feel her soft skin once again ."
"he kissed her deeply , absorbing her moans into his mouth and feeling her rise against his hand , her heart racing as he pressed his hand against her breast ."
"he lifted up slightly and looked around , astounded that he was actually making love to this woman in an empty house ."
"one that was n't even his ."
"yet !"
"he pulled her clothes off , uncaring of what was around him , which was nothing but hers and his discarded clothes at the moment ."
"and a wall of windows where anyone could look into since there were n't any curtains ."
"he did n't care ."
"she was underneath him and writhing with her own need and he succumbed ."
"pulling her slacks off , he quickly came back down to her , covering her nakedness with his body ."
"and when his clothes hindered him , he stood up and ripped his own clothes off ."
"she did n't stop him ."
"in fact , when he lowered himself to the floor , covering her once again , she opened her legs , just as eager for his invasion as he was ."
"`` tell me you want me , '' he ordered , holding his body above hers , looking down at her , seeing the sweat against her own brow and feeling the impatience , the urgency of her body ."
"watching her , seeing her body flushed with the heat of her own need and he almost gave in ."
"but he needed the words ."
"wanted to hear her say it ."
"she 'd denied it too often over the past two days and he needed those words for some reason ."
"`` i want you , '' she almost screamed out , her body pressing against his ."
"`` please do n't make me wait ! ''"
"she 'd said it , and she could n't take back the words !"
"with exultation , he moved against her , his body pressing inside hers and feeling her tightness close in around him ."
"this had never felt so good , so right !"
"he did n't slow down , would n't let her hide ."
"he pounded into her , showing her with actions that she 'd been lying to him ."
"`` you 're mine , siri , '' he said as he watched her face , moved in and out of her , pressing himself deeper and feeling her clench around him ."
"he almost lost it but he was determined to show her that they were perfect for each other ."
"and he also wanted to ensure that she could n't deny their attraction to each other any longer ."
"if this was the only way to get through to her , then he 'd use it ."
"and they 'd both enjoy the journey !"
"when he felt her shudders start , he could n't help but let his own body find fulfillment ."
"he 'd been a day without this woman , without feeling this incredible heat and passion and that drove him harder ."
"she was like an addiction , he thought ."
"one he was n't going to ignore or even fight ."
"in fact , he 'd use it more and more to convince her that they were meant to be together ."
"as siri came back down to earth , she could n't help but marvel at what an amazing lover malik was ."
"not that she had anything to compare it to , but she heard other women talk about sex with their partners and she could n't contribute ."
"they would laugh at how inept their husbands or lovers were , how insensitive ."
"but malik was incredible , damn him !"
"he knew exactly where to touch and how to move to drive her crazy ."
"`` you 're not having your own room , siri , '' he growled as he bent low and kissed her neck ."
"`` we 're sleeping together , and that 's final . ''"
"chapter 9 siri watched in wonder as malik stepped out of the limousine and approached the house ."
"she 'd been with him for a week in the new house and she could n't believe how messed up she felt ."
"she was so in love with the man she could barely think at work ."
"her desk was piled up with actions she needed to take , orders she needed to review and she found herself fantasizing about him all the time ."
"they 'd purchased that house last week , the one where they 'd made love on the floor in front of the windows , and siri could n't believe how quickly he 'd made things happen ."
"she was living in the house now , with a decorator quickly filling up the space and adding color ."
"jacob and samuel loved all the open space , the new play area they had in a small , fenced in area of the back yard and the play room filled with new toys and different games to play ."
"there were so many different toys for building from legos to blocks and even some sort of rubber beams that would help them build forts ."
"she 'd love that material so much , she 'd added it to her inventory and it was going to be the front cover specialty for the christmas catalog ."
"and they especially loved having a dad that came home to them every night , played with them , showed them how to do different things and taught them endless new ideas ."
"the part they loved the most , he never ran out of answers for their questions ."
"after dinner , they would climb onto his lap and ask him questions or they would sit on the floor and play with their toys and their curious minds would come up with the most amazing ideas , all of which malik encouraged and helped them to channel in positive ways ."
"for a man who had n't known the twins existed a month ago , he 'd certainly risen to the job of being a father with amazing speed ."
"the boys ' large bedroom had been the first for the recently hired decorator to furnish and she 'd added a wonderful surround of sports and animals ."
"she 'd sat down and talked to jacob and samuel , asking them what they wanted on their walls , what kinds of animals they liked , what sports and any kind of secret places they might want ."
"the result was a mural of a jungle scene on one wall , a desert on another and a loft type sleeping area with a `` hideout '' below where they loved to hide from their mother ."
"the master bedroom had been the second area to be tackled and the decorator done an outstanding job of creating an elegant , but sumptuous room with masculine colors and feminine touches ."
"not that malik noticed ."
"he was with the boys until their bed times and then he 'd pull her into his arms and make love to her until she fell asleep ."
"she had no idea what he was doing after she fell asleep , but he was gone by the time she woke up in the morning ."
"which made things a bit more difficult for her , she thought as she rushed out for work each morning after giving instructions to the new nanny and tutor ."
"siri wanted to talk to malik about various issues but he was n't around to discuss them with her ."
"and when he was , he would n't let her talk much , having other plans for their nights together ."
"as much as she 'd objected to a move to a new house initially , she had to admit that life was a whole lot easier now , and in ways she had n't expected ."
"there was a fantastic nanny who watched over the boys and both of them loved her , eagerly running to greet her each morning after breakfast to find out what she was going to teach them during each day ."
"apparently malik gave her instructions but he was very considerate about talking to siri about those decisions as well , making her feel as if she were a part of the decision making process , when in fact , he was pushing the agenda ."
"for some reason , siri was n't overly concerned with this since he explained why any particular lesson was needed and how it would all fit into their overall lessons ."
"she loved him even more for his patience with her questions and helping her understand why he was doing certain things ."
"she had n't expected that of her and his explanations eased several of her largest worries ."
"she did n't feel like she was losing her boys but instead , she felt like a part of their lessons ."
"after they finished with their nanny , they would eagerly run to her and snuggle with her while telling her all of the amazing things they 'd learned during the day ."
"there was also a very efficient housekeeper who kept the entire house immaculately clean , expertly laundered and pressed their clothes and also made sure that there was a nutritious dinner on the table when it was time to eat , with lots of vegetables snuck into the meal ."
"the boys had no idea that , along with their macaroni and cheese , they were also getting loads of tofu and cauliflower ."
"their pancakes were loaded with carrots and zucchini and so many other nutritious foods , that even siri was n't sure what was in them ."
"siri loved the food and the boys thought it tasted better than the original ."
"go figure , she thought one night when the boys devoured a meal with hidden broccoli ."
"malik walked into the house and siri 's heart swelled with love for the man when she noticed his eyes immediately looking for her , and then noticed his shoulders relaxing when he found her in the front room , obviously waiting for him ."
"his long legs quickly devoured the space between the front door and where she was standing so when malik reached her , she was already bracing for his kiss , and the shivers that sent her body into overdrive ."
"some day , she hoped to grow used to his warm touch ."
"it was still such a shock to her system whenever he came close ."
"`` i have some bad news , '' he replied and looked down into her now worried eyes ."
"`` i have to fly back to duban ."
"i have to pave the way for the boys to be accepted as my sons ."
"but it wo n't be a difficult trip , i promise . ''"
"that made her stomach clench with fear ."
"back to duban ?"
"he had n't been her long enough this time !"
"her mind flew back to the last time he 'd left her and she could n't repress the fear that welled up inside of her at the idea of losing him once again ."
"`` is that going to be a contentious trip ? ''"
"`` no ."
"i 've already sent dna samples back from their hair and i 've openly declared them to be my sons ."
"it 's just a formality now ."
"and some legal issues that need to be finalized . ''"
"siri stepped back out of his arms , a cold terror coming over her ."
"`` when do you have to leave ? ''"
"she asked , not wanting to hear the answer , wishing he could just stay here with them , never going back to the country that had taken him away from her before ."
"she was being selfish , but could n't help it ."
"it was almost like she 'd lost him already ."
"he could see the fear and withdrawal in her eyes and was n't sure how to reassure her ."
"he suspected that the only way to get her to trust him was to follow through with his promise to bring all three of them back with him once these legalities were finalized ."
"`` tonight , unfortunately ."
"the sooner i leave , the faster i can get this cleared up and come back to get the three of you . ''"
"siri had heard these words before ."
"she 'd seen the worried look on his face that last time as well ."
"it had all happened four years ago and she hated the idea of him leaving them ."
"there was something wrong and he was n't telling her what it was ."
"just like the last time ."
"and four years ago , he 'd gone home and ended up married to another woman ."
"`` you 'd better get things cleared up then , '' she said with as much equanimity as possible ."
"she knew something was wrong , but she also knew that he kept things close to his chest , dealing with the problems and leaving her out of it ."
"he thought he was trying to protect her but he was only frightening her more by leaving her out ."
"`` i 'll hurry back , '' he said and started to pull her into his arms ."
"siri stepped back , not willing to let him touch her when she knew something was n't right ."
"`` i 'll see you when you get back , '' she replied , crossing her arms over her chest and looking away ."
"`` you do n't have to worry about anything , siri ."
"the boys are taken care of and i wo n't abandon you again . ''"
"she looked up at him , but could n't reach his eyes , stopping at his chin instead ."
"that was as far she 'd go under the circumstances ."
"she forced her face to mimic a smile , but she knew she was pretty short of the mark ."
"`` good luck , '' she replied ."
"a part of her was already packing up their clothes , getting ready to move back into her little cottage which she 'd never given up even though he 'd tried to convince her to sell the house so he could invest the money for her ."
"part of her had always known that it would come to this ."
"her sons were her life and she would n't let them be hurt ."
"not even by their father ."
"which was why she 'd held on to their previous home , needing the security of her cottage to feel more in control in case anything might happen ."
"`` have a good trip , '' she said with finality ."
"malik watched her carefully , trying to understand what was going on in her mind ."
"he wanted so badly to convince her to marry him but he could n't figure out why she was pulling away so suddenly ."
"he had a large diamond ring in his pocket that he 'd been carrying around for several days , wanting to see it on her finger , to know that she was his and only his ."
"he wanted visible evidence of her commitment to him , but the time had never seemed right recently ."
"he 'd hoped to put it on her finger tonight , wanting her promise to him before he went back to duban ."
"he 'd already told his advisors of his intent to marry siri ."
"they knew about his sons and were thrilled that the question of his marriage and heir was resolved ."
"all of them were completely on board with his plans and excited about meeting jacob and samuel , although they 'd tried to convince malik to change their names to something more traditional ."
"he 'd only laughed and overrode their requests ."
"now he had to finish up a few details and then they 'd be his family , officially and irrevocably ."
"so what was holding her back ?"
"she 'd come willingly into his arms every night for the past week ."
"she 'd been more passionate than before , demanding all of him and not holding anything back herself ."
"and he 'd been more than willing to give it to her , thrilled that the woman he remembered was so passionate and sexy ."
"damn he wanted her in his arms right now , he wanted to bury himself in her one more time , just to feel her heat wrapping around him and one more chance to show her that they were perfect together ."
"he 'd thought he 'd loved her before , but that was nothing compared to how he felt about her now ."
"he could n't imagine life without her now ."
"she and the boys were such an integral part of his world already and he wanted to bring them all back immediately ."
"he resented the legal issues he needed to resolve before bringing his family to his home but it was just one more of the obligations he faced as leader of duban ."
"with a sigh , he bent down and kissed the boys , closing his eyes and holding them both close to him and enjoying their enthusiastic hugs ."
"`` i 'll see both of you soon , '' he said with emphasis ."
"`` do n't drive your mother crazy ! ''"
"he said sternly ."
"`` what if i have a question for you ? ''"
"sam asked , his chubby hands touching malik 's cheek ."
"`` then ask your mother if you can call me ."
"or you can text me anytime you want and i 'll get back to you with an answer . ''"
"jacob seemed concerned ."
"`` what if we do n't agree with your answer ? ''"
"he suggested , his eyebrows drawn together over his worried eyes ."
"`` we might need to understand more or ... . ''"
"malik instantly understood that they were n't concerned with questions , they were more concerned with when they were going to see him again , but their toddler minds were wrapping around a more pressing issue instead ."
"he did his best to reassure them , squeezing them gently to show them that he understood their worries ."
"`` then we 'll discuss any questions or disagreements you have as soon as i can give you a call back ."
"and i 'll make sure that my advisors know that you three have top priority in my daily schedule so they wo n't turn away any messages you might have , no matter how small ."
"okay ? ''"
"jacob considered this and finally nodded his head in agreement ."
"`` deal . ''"
"he even stuck his little hand out to shake it but malik chuckled and pulled him into his arms for another hug ."
"samuel went right along with malik and jacob , smiling over malik 's shoulder as he enjoyed his hug from their newly discovered father ."
"standing up , he looked at siri ."
"he wanted to hug her , to kiss her and make her cling to him like she had during the previous several nights ."
"but her body language was clearly shouting for him to leave her alone ."
"he started to walk away , trying hard to respect her overt signals for space ."
"but he only took a few steps before he stopped , cursed under his breath and spun around ."
"he walked over to her and pulled her stiff body into his arms , kissing her and running his hands over all of her secret places only he knew about until she softened and kissed him back ."
"and even then , he continued for several more minutes , enjoying her soft sighs and little moans she had no idea she actually made when he kissed her he did n't stop until he heard sam and jacob giggle off to the side ."
"only then did he lift his head and look down into her soft , beautiful features and nod his head in approval ."
"`` that 's better , '' he declared ."
"with one more peck , he turned around and headed back out the door , determined to get the business out of the way so he could officially bring them all back to duban and marry that annoying , confusing , beautiful and sexy woman ."
"he wanted everyone to know that she was his woman and they could n't touch her for any reason ."
"and his boys were the most amazing little creatures ."
"he 'd never known that boys could be so fascinating and curious and interesting to talk to ."
"he never tired of their questions , continuously fascinated by how their minds processed their world ."
"he had obligations though and he had to focus on those in order to make his family whole again ."
"he 'd never allow anything to get in the way of his world like it had four years ago ."
"he knew now that he should have done things differently in the past , not given in to his father 's pressure and found a better way to solve the problems of the country rather than marry his ex-wife ."
"with determination , he slipped into the back of the limousine and ordered his driver to get him to the airport in half the time ."
"at this point , he did n't even care if he broke the traffic laws ."
"he just wanted to be back here as fast as possible so he could take his family home and make that woman his wife ."
"he wanted the world to know that she was his and no one could mess with her ."
"and he wanted to know that she would be in his bed every night with her warm smile and gentle heart ."
"siri watched with a sinking feeling as the beautiful limousine quickly pulled away , the back tires skidding as the driver sped away from the house as fast as possible ."
"she did n't understand malik 's motivation today and she really did n't understand why he was so frantic to get away from them ."
"she would have sworn that he loved being with the boys , and she definitely enjoyed having him around , even though she 'd fought it hard at first ."
"besides , he never hesitated to pull her into his strong , secure arms , but maybe she again was just a convenient outlet for his desires ."
"the man was certainly passionate ."
"perhaps he saw the boys as an unexpected obligation on top of so many others he was constantly burdened with ."
"or maybe he just had sex with her as a way to secure her feelings towards him so he could claim the boys as his own ."
"no , she did n't think that was the case ."
"he was too solicitous of her opinion and seemed to genuinely want her advice or perspective ."
"if he were going to take the boys away , she suspected he would start to pull away from asking her opinion versus increasing her involvement ."
"not that she would let him , anyway ."
"as she stood there by the window , the tail lights of his vehicle slowly fading away , her heart felt like it was a lead brick , and sunk further into her stomach ."
"why could n't she figure this man out ?"
"why was he so complicated ?"
"and why , why , why did she have to fall in love with a man like him ?"
"why could n't she have fallen for someone normal and boring ?"
"someone who would n't have to fly halfway around the world just to reach his home ?"
"there were wonderful men , probably right down the street ?"
"what was it about malik that she just thought was so special ?"
"she heard the boys in the background and pulled her worried eyes away from the large , sunny window ."
"there was n't anything to see anymore so it was pointless now ."
"it was the middle of the afternoon and she had several urgent issues still to finalize at work ."
"she did n't have time to think about malik and why he did n't want to be around them ."
"she thought her boys were pretty amazing so it was his fault that he did n't want to experience each day with them ."
"siri picked up both of her excited boys and gave them each a hug and a kiss , then headed into the office malik had set up for her to work in ."
"this was definitely nice of him , she thought as she rounded her beautiful , shiny wooden desk that was absolutely perfect for her needs ."
"lots of drawers , a wide area for her computer and monitor not to mention a state of the art sound system that allowed her to play whatever music suited her mood ."
"he was definitely generous , she 'd give him that ."
"but to what end ?"
"she fingered the files she needed to work on while she puzzled through possible scenarios , but in the end , she could n't guess what malik 's end game was , other than taking her boys from her , which she absolutely would not allow !"
"the boys would be finishing up their afternoon classes with the nanny soon and she no longer had to worry about dinner , which was a glorious freedom since she sincerely disliked cooking ."
"maybe she could take the boys to the playground for a while , get their minds off of malik 's departure ."
"they had n't been outside in the sunshine very much lately due to a more rigorous school schedule and several rainy days , so this would be a nice change ."
"she did n't mind the increased lessons since the boys were absolutely loving the additional information , sucking up any new lesson like little sponges ."
"siri looked down at her cluttered desk and gritted her teeth ."
"she would have to focus if she wanted to get all these issues resolved in time ."
"she worked steadily through the rest of the afternoon , resolving several outstanding problems by refusing to let her mind wander , especially to try and figure out malik 's motivation ."
"she worked hard until the boys came running into her office ."
"she then determinedly shut down her work computer and gathered up all the play stuff they would need in order to have a good time at the playground ."
"playing out in the sunshine , running along the green grass with rover and boy while they chased balls , pushing jacob and samuel on the swing and laughing as they raced up the ladder for the slide was exactly what she needed to get her mind off of the depressing events of the afternoon ."
"these two boys were the right antidote for any kind of depression she thought as the three of them walked back to the car hand in hand , the boys chattering about their rambunctious activities while the dogs kept reaching up to lick a cheek or nudge a hand for some attention ."
"the next few days followed the same pattern and siri was amazed at how well they worked their days around their new schedule without malik ."
"if she had to force herself to focus at times during the afternoon because she caught herself fantasizing about a tall , handsome sheik who was missing , she 'd just push herself harder to get more done ."
"the only exception to their routine was when malik called each night ."
"they boys loved talking with him , telling him all that they 'd learned with their new nanny that day and asking him questions to show her the following day that they were on top of their lessons ."
"her teachings were filled with various animals , different countries of the world , cultures and siri was amazed at how the woman snuck in geography , all of which the boys just loved , their little minds grasping concepts that others would n't probably understand until they were much older ."
"she was so emotionally distraught over malik 's departure that by the time his phone call arrived , she was barely able to tuck the boys into bed before she fell asleep herself ."
"she wanted to stay up later and talk with malik , to ask him questions and find out how things were going in duban or just finish up her own work , possibly get ahead of the curve that she 'd felt she 'd been under lately ."
"but she could barely keep her eyes open , the emotional stress wearing her down ."
"one night when he called , she 'd just tucked the boys into bed and brushed her own teeth ."
"she was climbing into bed when her phone rang and she instinctively knew it would be him even though this was n't the time he generally called her in the evenings ."
"she tried to smile , but she was so painfully tired she could barely press the button to answer ."
"`` how are you ? ''"
"he asked , his voice strong and vibrant and siri was jealous that he could be so wide awake while she continued to feel so painfully exhausted ."
"`` tired , '' she claimed and yawned so she could n't say anything more ."
"he hesitated while she finished her yawn before continuing ."
"`` what did you do today ? ''"
"he asked , his voice brusque as he tried to determine why she was pushing him away ."
"each phone call was becoming shorter and shorter ."
"she claimed exhaustion , but he 'd seen her running her business and running after those two boys before and she had n't acted like this at that point ."
"something was wrong , he thought as he tried to come up with something that would inspire conversation ."
"siri thought his tone was becoming impatient , but she was n't able to focus enough to make a determination ."
"`` oh , we received several large orders at the office and had to rush the distribution ."
"so it 's been a good week so far ."
"what about you ? ''"
"she asked and closed her eyes , curling up in the bed they 'd shared for just over a week before he 'd left ."
"had it only been two weeks since he 'd come back into their lives ?"
"so much had happened , her whole life was different now ."
"`` what about you ? ''"
"she asked and snuggled down into the large pillows that were placed behind her on the bed ."
"it was a decadent feeling to slide into a bed that she had n't made earlier in the day ."
"she still was n't used to someone taking care of the house for her , but it was definitely something she could enjoy while it lasted ."
"he started to talk , but she kept yawning so she only heard about half of what he said ."
"`` that sounds good , '' she replied , but was n't really sure if anything he 'd said was good , bad or horrible ."
"there was a long pause and malik finally asked , `` siri , are you okay ? ''"
"`` of course , '' she replied , smothering another yawn ."
"`` why do you ask ? ''"
"`` you seem a bit standoffish ."
"i want the old siri back . ''"
"she should be angry at his comment , but she was just too tired ."
"she snuggled deeper into the pillows , pulling a soft , fluffy blanket over her legs because it was just too much effort to get under the covers ."
"`` sorry ."
"i 'm not sure why i 'm so tired ."
"i 'm not normally like this , am i ? ''"
"she heard the frustration come through the phone with his tone and tried to sit up , but the pillows were just too comfortable ."
"`` maybe it 's the weather . ''"
"`` how are things going over where you are ? ''"
"she asked , trying to sound more upbeat , but it was a huge effort to just form the words ."
"all she wanted to do was close her eyes and fall asleep , not to be disturbed for about ten hours ."
"`` things could be better , '' he said with a deep sigh ."
"he thought about the petty squabbles his advisors were having about his wedding to siri and stifled his irritation since it was n't productive ."
"some wanted a huge affair that would take months to coordinate ; others wanted a fast event that would show the world that they accepted his new wife unequivocally ."
"either way , the wedding was going to happen and they were all excited about welcoming siri and the boys into their world and helping them to assimilate into the duban culture ."
"it was just taking longer than anticipated to temper their excitement and get down to the details ."
"`` there 's lots of arguing and ridiculous things to work out ."
"but we 'll get there . ''"
"something in his tone alerted her to a problem and she roused herself enough to ask , `` i thought you 'd be back by now ."
"i hope things are n't going poorly ."
"there 's no question about the boys , are there ? ''"
"he heard the worry in her tone and wanted to reassure her quickly ."
"`` none at all ."
"everyone is thrilled that an heir is already in place . ''"
"he chuckled as he said , `` they were worried about my virility , if you can believe it . ''"
"siri had to laugh at that and it felt good ."
"she 'd been so tired and tense lately that even the smallest laugh felt wonderful ."
"`` i can attest to your ... .abilities , if they have any questions . ''"
"he chuckled at her teasing choice of words , some of the tension leaving him as he heard her laughter once again ."
"`` i 'd like you to be testing my abilities right now . ''"
"`` what ?"
"no little harem women hanging about to entertain you ? '"
"she joked , but the idea of him having a harem was extremely painful ."
"`` you 're my only harem woman ."
"and i can guarantee that you 'll be dressing up for me in some sexy , skimpy outfit with lots of scarves that i 'll rip off that luscious body of yours ."
"you will definitely be entertaining me when you get here ."
"i need lots and lots of your special brand of entertaining . ''"
"he said it with that sexy , deep voice of his that never failed to make her stomach do a flip flop ."
"`` as long as i can entertain you my way . ''"
"`` any way you want will be fine with me . ''"
"`` any way ? ''"
"`` absolutely . ''"
"`` what if i want to watch television ? ''"
"she teased ."
"`` then you 'll be watching television while i ravish your body ! ''"
"he growled ."
"siri laughed and then smothered another yawn ."
"`` you 're falling asleep on me ."
"am i that uninteresting ? ''"
"she could n't help but laugh again ."
"she loved the teasing , not used to this from him ."
"he was usually so stern and officious unless he was playing with the boys ."
"but even then , he took all of their questions so seriously ."
"she really liked this new side of malik ."
"it made him much more human and approachable ."
"`` so when are you coming back ? ''"
"`` as soon as i can come back and bring the three of you back here ."
"there are just a few more details that need to be worked out . ''"
"all the tension came right back and she rolled over to stare out into the darkness of her bedroom windows ."
"`` any details i need to be aware of ? ''"
"`` nothing really ."
"just irritating arguments that do n't make any sense in the larger sense of this situation . ''"
"siri did n't like being referred to as a `` situation '' ."
"she wanted to be the center of his life and to make him happy the way he always did for her and the boys as soon as he walked into a room ."
"being referred to as a 'situation ' sounded bad ."
"`` well , i 'll let you go so that you can resolve those situations , '' she replied tartly ."
"her fatigue was really starting to get to her ."
"`` sorry ."
"i 'm just tired ."
"i 'll talk to you later , okay ? ''"
"`` okay ."
"sleep well , '' he replied , smothering his frustration , and hung up the phone ."
"siri turned off her own phone then slid down into the soft , silky sheets , tears coming down her cheeks as she thought about all the things she really wanted to say to malik , but had n't had the courage ."
"and none of those things had to do with television , situations , politics or arguments with his advisors , which were probably about her and what a promiscuous woman she was to have had children out of wedlock ."
"she 'd heard about these men and how they viewed women ."
"they were probably trying to think of some way to get the boys without the mom ."
"she fell asleep vowing that she 'd never let anyone take her children away from her ."
"chapter 10 half a world away , malik angrily walked down the long , ornate hallway , not aware of any of the elaborate decor that surrounded him in the magnificent palace , or the ancient history of the structure ."
"all he cared about was getting back to siri and the boys , of bringing them here so they could be a family without all the silly issues to deal with ."
"last night 's call to siri had disturbed him and he worried that she was changing her mind about coming to live with him ."
"he had to marry her , he had to have her in his life ."
"there was no other woman who suited him like she did and he would n't allow anything more to slow this wedding down ."
"no more conversations about the best way to bring his family home and how she might or might not take any inadvertent slight if the ceremony went one way or another ."
"he was disgusted that he 'd allowed the debates to go on this long when the woman he loved was too far away for him to care for and protect , much less understand ."
"it was past time he put his foot down and firmly explained how this wedding was going to move forward ."
"better to leave them out of his marriage now since he would n't allow any of their interference later on ."
"his personal life was no longer a topic for debate ."
"inside his council house , his advisors were already assembled , all of them excitedly discussing their ideas for his wedding ."
"but as soon as he walked in , silence descended ."
"he sat down and glared at the men along each side of the table , ensuring that each of them understood his frustrations ."
"`` i spoke to siri last night and this is what i 'm going to do ... '' he said ."
"not a single person argued with him and within an hour , all of them stood up to carry out their leader 's orders , eager to welcome their queen and future kings ."
"not another argument , not even a suggestion ."
"when malik spoke , they followed ."
"he 'd led their country out of a potentially violent civil war with very little bloodshed , had united their tribes and had demonstrated that , through his leadership , their country could be a powerhouse in the world ."
"they would follow him through hell if he requested it and now all of them wanted to be able to say that they had helped to bring his bride to their sheik 's home ."
"five hours later , malik was on his private plane , flying back to siri and his sons , the only indication that he was concerned was the blank expression on his face ."
"the more serious the expression , the graver the issues he was facing ."
"right now , with the thought of losing siri , his face was a complete , blank mask ."
"siri laughed as jacob climbed up on her lap and gave her a sloppy kiss ."
"`` what was that for ? ''"
"she asked , pulling him close for a hug ."
"he shrugged and snuggled into her lap , making himself comfortable ."
"`` you seemed sad ."
"you always give me a kiss when i 'm sad so i gave one back ! ''"
"he grinned up at her as if he 'd worked through something miraculous ."
"and in a way , he had done exactly that ."
"he was sweet and wonderful and she 'd been stomping around in a grumpy mood for the past two days ."
"she wanted malik back , but not if he did n't want them ."
"and they were a package deal ."
"no separation , no sporadic visits ."
"she was n't losing her kids !"
"and if he wanted her , he 'd better prove it because she was n't feeling it lately ."
"she was only feeling tired and exhausted and just plain old grumpy and mean ."
"`` do you think daddy will be back today ? ''"
"sam asked , climbing up onto the other side of her lap , pushing his brother out of the way to make room for himself ."
"`` i do n't know honey ."
"we need to give daddy some time to work through the issues he has to face ."
"we ca n't pressure him . ''"
"jacob sat up and looked out the window ."
"`` he 's home ! ''"
"he called out and clumsily scrambled off of her lap ."
"siri looked out the window , wondering what he 'd seen that would make him jump up like that ."
"sure enough , sam was quick to follow his brother and both little guys were out of the room like bullets !"
"they raced through the house and pulled open the front door ."
"siri was right behind them , but she could barely catch her breath for some reason and her two guys were out the front door before she could stop them ."
"she was terrified that , in their exuberance to see malik , they would run out in front of the vehicle and be hurt ."
"but she should have known better ."
"as soon as she reached the front door , she looked out and the body guard who had been standing sentry by the front door was holding sam under his right arm and jacob under the left , both of whom were grinning from ear to ear as they watched the long , black car pull up in front of the house ."
"siri bit her lip as malik got out of the car ."
"she was worried that he would be angry with them for running out of the house but it was really her fault for not being fast enough with them ."
"and she had n't locked the front door like she normally did , even going so far as to have a lock installed on the top of the door just for this kind of instance ."
"they were fast and getting faster , so she had to ensure their safety ."
"`` it was my fault malik , '' she quickly intercepted him , trying to keep him from scolding the boys ."
"`` what 's your fault ? ''"
"he asked as he looked down at both boys who were at his feet , grabbing his leg on both sides and demanding that they be recognized as well ."
"`` you 're home ! ''"
"they both cried out , wiggling in an effort to be lifted into his arms ."
"malik did n't hesitate ."
"he bent down and lifted both into his strong arms , nuzzling each on their little necks until they were giggling bundles of movement and happiness ."
"`` have both of you been minding your manners ? ''"
"he asked and nodded when they told him that they had been very good ."
"malik turned to the guard who had caught them and nodded ."
"in response , the guard bowed deeply and siri was shocked to see evidence that malik really was a king ."
"he 'd said that her boys were princes , but she had n't made the leap that he was also royalty ."
"good grief , she thought , she had so much to learn ."
"or maybe she did n't ."
"she looked back at him warily , bracing herself for whatever news he might be bringing ."
"was he here to tell her that he was heading back alone ?"
"she had to be prepared for anything with this man ."
"she 'd gone through hell the last time ."
"she would n't be mentally unprepared again ."
"`` how are you ? ''"
"he asked as he carried the boys into the house ."
"malik looked at her carefully , noticing the dark circles under her eyes and the fatigue that made her shoulders droop with exhaustion ."
"`` you look tired ."
"did you not sleep well last night ? ''"
"he asked gently as they entered the house ."
"`` i am . ''"
"`` are you eating okay ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"she was actually irritated that he would ask something so ridiculous ."
"she was a grown woman ."
"what business was it of his if she ate well or decided on pizza morning , noon and night ?"
"she bit her tongue though , not wanting his homecoming to be marred by her bad mood ."
"malik looked down at the boys ."
"`` would you mind if i had a private word with your mother ? ''"
"he asked , but his voice was firm , indicating that it was n't a request ."
"`` go find laura and see if she can dig up some information on crocodiles ."
"i bet i can come up with more facts about them than you can , '' he said ."
"the boys both looked up at him , their eyes wide with excitement ."
"`` crocodiles ? ''"
"they echoed ."
"comically , sam and jacob looked directly at each other , then back up at their father , then the two of them raced out of the living room as fast as their little legs would carry them ."
"when both of them were out of ear shot , he turned back to siri ."
"`` okay , what 's going on ? ''"
"he asked , his hands on his hips as he glared down at her ."
"`` tell me you 're not married , '' she whispered , the fear almost choking her ."
"at her question , malik finally understood what she 'd been thinking these past few days and his body relaxed ."
"he pulled her closer , his arms wrapping around her stiff body ."
"`` i 'm not married ."
"yet . ''"
"she shoved out of his arms and glared up at him ."
"`` what do you mean ?"
"if you tell me that you 're engaged to another woman , so help me malik ... '' `` i 'm engaged to you , siri . ''"
"his voice was soft , but firm , not trying to tease her in any way because he finally understood why she had been so stressed while he was away ."
"those were n't the words she was expecting to hear so when he said them like that , just as a statement of fact as if it were a fait accompli , she could only stand there in front of him in stunned silence ."
"`` we 're engaged ? ''"
"she whispered , too afraid of believing him ."
"had she misunderstood ?"
"`` yes ."
"we 're engaged ."
"we 're getting married the day after we arrive in duban ."
"you 're going to ... . ''"
"she interrupted him by raising her hand to stop him ."
"`` hold that thought , '' she said and quickly ran out of the room and into the powder room off the hallway ."
"she was so embarrassed when she slammed the door shut and then emptied the contents of her stomach into the toilet , heaving over and over again ."
"when she was finished , she felt a cold towel press against her forehead and she slid against the wall , grateful for the support ."
"`` thank you , '' she said quietly and closed her eyes , waiting for the wave of nausea to ease ."
"`` were you that worried about what was going on ? ''"
"he asked gently as he knelt down in front of her ."
"she thought about it for a few moments , and then nodded her head ."
"`` i was terrified to read the newspapers and i would n't even log onto the internet , afraid i might see something ."
"that 's how i found out about your first marriage . ''"
"he picked her up and carried her to the sofa in the living room , holding her there while she laid her head on his shoulder ."
"she was too weak from the bout of nausea to fight him ."
"and by now , she did n't want to ."
"the words , `` i 'm engaged to you , siri '' kept running through her mind , a dream that was too precious to believe in yet ."
"he nodded his head as well and pulled her close , his fingers tangling in her hair ."
"`` i know you have n't wanted to hear an explanation , but i think it 's time we finally talked about what happened so you can understand why i got married that weekend ."
"i want to assure you first off that it was n't my choice and if i could have done things differently , i would have ."
"i loved you back then , but i 'd been with you so much during the time we were together , i 'd become out of touch with what was happening at home ."
"i went home that weekend and was told about an uprising in the north of my country ."
"my father was furious that he was being cornered in that way and ordered me to marry the daughter of the tribal leader who had instigated the rebellion ."
"she and i met for the first time the same day we were married . ''"
"siri 's whole body tensed , but that brought back the nausea so she forced herself to relax back against his warm chest ."
"`` so you were n't engaged before then ? ''"
"`` i was never engaged to her ."
"ever !"
"i only wanted to marry you ."
"please believe me , siri ."
"you have been the only woman i 've ever loved and even my ex-wife knew that i was n't emotionally involved with the relationship ."
"it was n't the cause of the breakup , but it definitely did n't help . ''"
"`` why did n't you ? ''"
"he looked down at her pale face , confused by her question ."
"`` why did n't i what ?"
"love her ? ''"
"she did n't even bother to shake her head , afraid of the consequences to her stomach ."
"`` no ."
"why did n't you marry me four years ago ? ''"
"`` i was n't sure how you felt about me ."
"you were still in school , so smart and beautiful ."
"you had so many plans for what you wanted to do with your education and marrying me would take all of that away ."
"i wanted you to be happy more than i wanted to marry you . ''"
"`` why ? ''"
"she could n't look up at him , but she snuggled against him more , her nose pressed to his warm neck and smelling his wonderful scent ."
"`` honey , you ca n't have a career and be married to me ."
"i wish it were otherwise , but there are too many obligations ."
"especially in the business you 're in , there would be implications of favoritism . ''"
"`` you mean someone would try and buy my favors by going through my company to order their toys ? ''"
"`` exactly . ''"
"she thought about that for all of two seconds ."
"`` okay ."
"i 'll sell it off ."
"i know exactly who should have first chance at it too , '' she said , thinking of joe and his efficiency , his dedication ."
"malik looked down at her , trying to determine if he understood her correctly ."
"`` are you saying that you 're willing to give up all that you 've worked for to be my wife ? ''"
"she smiled up at him ."
"`` i 've done the career part , malik . ''"
"she took a deep breath and forged on , determined to be brave and honest with him ."
"`` and i did n't like life without you . ''"
"`` i hated being married to that woman , siri ."
"you 're the only woman i ever wanted by my side . ''"
"`` why did you marry her then ? ''"
"`` my father ordered it ."
"and i did n't have time to figure out an alternative before the wedding ."
"i was cornered and it took me all this time to work a solution for the tribes in the northern area of the country to get along without the marriage ."
"my ex-wife and i both worked hard over the years to make sure that any kind of separation between us would n't impact the peace ."
"she 's a good woman , but not the one for me ."
"only you are that woman . ''"
"she ran her fingers over his arm , feeling the hair against his warm skin and loving him even more for all of his dedication ."
"`` i ca n't believe your ex-wife was willing to give you up . ''"
"he shrugged and looked down at her ."
"`` she was n't really into me , '' he explained diplomatically ."
"she thought about it for a moment , and came up with the right explanation ."
"`` she was a lesbian ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"`` so that 's why you did n't have any children with her ? ''"
"`` exactly . ''"
"`` she was an idiot , '' siri replied , leaning her head against his shoulder weakly ."
"he laughed softly and squeezed her shoulders ."
"`` she would have loved you ! ''"
"siri smacked his thigh , but there was no force behind her movement ."
"`` i 'm sorry you were so worried about what was happening , '' he finally said ."
"`` do you want to move anywhere ?"
"i 'm fine with you right here , just trying to figure out what 's going on with you lately . ''"
"siri smiled and shook her head ."
"`` no ."
"i 'm fine right here . ''"
"he nodded his head ."
"`` how long is this going to last ? ''"
"he asked ."
"siri thought about it for a moment and then tensed ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"he asked , feeling her body change and becoming alarmed ."
"`` malik , remember that first night we were together ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"`` did you happen to use a condom ? ''"
"he stilled as he thought back to that night ."
"`` yes ."
"hell , '' he cursed quietly ."
"`` it might have broken ."
"i was n't sure and completely forgot to mention it . ''"
"she laughed and put her hand on his chest ."
"`` how soon is the wedding ? ''"
"`` as soon as we get back to duban ."
"everything is arranged which is what took me so long to get back here ."
"i wanted everything ready so you could n't wiggle out of the ceremony . ''"
"`` would you mind terribly if we left maybe this afternoon ? ''"
"`` are you telling me ... ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"i think we 're going to have another little one running around whatever palace you 're going to make us live in . ''"
"malik picked her up and hugged her gently , careful not to upset her stomach again ."
"`` i love you , '' he said as he kissed her gently ."
"epilogue malik strode down the hallway , his steps eating up the distance between his office and the gymnasium ."
"his aide had just whispered in his ear and he was rushing to stop imminent catastrophe ."
"he heard their words before he reached the room , but he hurried even faster , wary of any of them demonstrating their skills ."
"`` stop ! ''"
"he commanded as soon as he entered the room ."
"four sets of eyes looked over at him , all of them wary and all wondering why he would be discouraging the use of their combat skills when he 'd taught them so well over the past several years ."
"`` danika , get off jacob immediately , '' he said , then turned to see his other two children ."
"`` samuel , you may not put your sister in a head lock ! ''"
"he ordered ."
"siri rushed into the room , already out of breath herself ."
"she 'd obviously received the same message and was here to stop her children from hurting each other as well ."
"`` good grief , '' she whispered as she noticed jacob glaring at his younger sister and samuel looking smug as lila brushed herself off ."
"`` what 's going on ? ''"
"malik turned so his back was facing his four children ."
"in this way , siri was the only one to see his amusement ."
"`` our children decided they were ready for real combat and thought they should fight to the death here . ''"
"siri glanced around , her mouth hanging open slightly in horror ."
"`` danika !"
"you 're three years old !"
"you can not fight to the death at three years old ! ''"
"danika humphed and looked at her sister who was a year older ."
"`` lila started it ."
"samuel said he knew more than she did so he said he could win . ''"
"malik 's shoulders shook and she glared back at him as well ."
"`` you 're actually to blame for this ! ''"
"she snapped at him , her hands on her hips , not appreciating any of his amusement when her children were about to harm each other ."
"he shook his head and approached her slowly ."
"`` how am i to blame ? ''"
"`` you 're the one who taught them all their moves ."
"and gave them the confidence to believe they could actually fight to the death !"
"do n't even try that innocent look with me ."
"you know exactly what you 've done . ''"
"malik turned back to his children , keeping a stern expression on his face ."
"`` i do n't ever want to hear any of you joking about fighting to the death with each other ."
"your combat skills are only for emergency and protective situations . ''"
"`` we were n't really going to fight to the death , dad , '' jacob said as he stood up ."
"`` we only wanted to teach them a lesson . ''"
"`` i 'm the only one who can teach this ."
"now go back to your studies and do n't let me find you in here again without supervision . ''"
"all four children stood at attention and bowed , appreciating that they were supposed to respect their black belt master before exiting any room ."
"siri had to smother her own smile as she watched their efforts , knowing that jacob and samuel would never hurt their sisters ."
"they were overly protective of them as it is , but she 'd panicked when she heard the message and was only now realizing how silly her fears had been ."
"even danika and lila would n't do anything to hurt their brothers , thinking the boys walked on water ."
"as she watched , jacob elbowed danika , whispering that she 'd done a good job ."
"and samuel was holding lila 's hand as he led her out of the gym ."
"all was well with her growing family and she sent up a silent prayer of gratitude for all of the wonderful gifts she 'd received ."
"malik walked over and put his hand on siri 's growing stomach , waiting to see if he could feel his next child move for him ."
"`` how are you feeling ? ''"
"he asked gently ."
"she chuckled and moved to one of the benches to sit down , accepting malik 's assistance as she carefully lowered her pregnant bulk down ."
"`` i 'd feel a whole lot better if my children were n't so competitive . ''"
"he laughed softly and sat down beside her , leaning against the wall as he released the tension that had accumulated after he 'd received the message that his children were fighting each other ."
"`` you 're beautiful , you know , '' he said and took her hand in his ."
"`` you 're pretty handsome yourself , '' she came back ."
"`` i love you . ''"
"he chuckled and moved closer , putting his arm around her protectively ."
"`` you can say that after what we just witnessed ? ''"
"`` you 've given me so much , including those little hellions , '' she sighed and pressed her cheek against his chest as he pulled her close ."
"`` i love you for all the little things you 've done for me . ''"
"`` i 'd like to give you more jewelry , '' he commented , noting that she was n't wearing any gold or diamonds with her blue dress that draped over her beautifully pregnant figure ."
"`` you 've given me something better than jewels , '' she came back ."
"`` you 've given me treasures beyond measure . ''"
"he looked down at the woman he 'd loved for so many years and smiled ."
"`` you 've given me a great deal as well . ''"
"chapter 1 `` dad , i just do n't think ... '' rachel stuart started to say ."
"her father gently interrupted her before she could come up with an excuse ."
"`` do n't say you do n't have the time ."
"i guarantee you wo n't regret this . ''"
"rachel bit her lip , wondering how she could say no to her father ."
"she knew he was lonely , but ... `` he 's not here , honey . ''"
"john stuart said the words softly , but her heart ached that her father knew ."
"she closed her eyes and took a deep , cleansing breath as the pain of her last visit to the farm swept through her ."
"she slowly let the air out of her lungs and straightened her shoulders , not willing to reveal too much even to her father ."
"`` i do n't care if he 's there or not dad ."
"this has nothing to ... '' `` rach ' , do n't even try it . ''"
"he softly interrupted her comment , knowing where this conversation would go if he allowed it ."
"`` your old dad knows what 's going on and i feel for you ."
"rais is n't scheduled to arrive until late tomorrow afternoon ."
"so if you do n't come out tonight , then you 're not going to be able to see these beauties for another month and i know you 're gon na love these guys . ''"
"'beauties ' ?"
"did that mean that new horses had arrived on the farm ?"
"he knew he 'd piqued her interest with that comment and she hesitated only briefly because if there was one thing in this world she loved besides her father it was horses ."
"and she was relieved that the man in question was n't scheduled to arrive until the following day ."
"`` what is it ? ''"
"she asked , trying to hide her curiosity but failing because whatever her father was calling about had to be big ."
"his relieved laughter flowed through the phone lines , knowing that he 'd gotten her with those words ."
"if there was one thing rachel hated it was to not know a secret ."
"he tormented her with christmas and birthday presents , and any surprises he could think of throughout the year just to tease her ."
"`` come out for dinner tonight and you 'll see . ''"
"he waited a moment before he said , `` i 'll make you macaroni and cheese , '' he said with a hopeful tone ."
"he 'd hit her weak point , damn him ."
"she closed her eyes , her hand gripping her cell phone as if she could find strength ."
"`` with the gorgonzola cheese ? ''"
"she whispered ."
"`` you bet , '' he laughed again , knowing that she was caught now ."
"`` i 'll see you at six o'clock ."
"do n't be late or i start eating it myself . ''"
"she groaned and shook her head ."
"`` fine ."
"i 'll be there . ''"
"he knew exactly how to lure her home for a visit ."
"his macaroni and cheese was the best with gorgonzola cheese and chives ."
"the man did n't stop there ."
"he added secret ingredients he would n't even give her a hint about so that she could n't figure out how to make it herself ."
"she 'd tried , just so she did n't have to risk running into the man in question , but she had n't come close and he was using that as her compensation for the risk involved in coming home ."
"after disconnecting , she stared at her computer screen , her eyes not really seeing anything ."
"her father knew , she thought with resignation and more than a little embarrassment ."
"he was n't a stupid man , so it was ridiculous of her to think that he had n't noticed her reaction to the man over the years ."
"but it would have been nice if it had just been her secret ."
"with resignation and embarrassment , she accepted that there were just some things a daughter could n't hide from her dad ."
"three hours later , she shut down her laptop and packed up her office , forcing a smile as she walked out of the building so her co-workers did n't know she felt like she was facing a death squad ."
"she usually timed these things better but she 'd already committed to the visit ."
"coming out tonight was cutting things a bit closer than she preferred ."
"it took her two hours with heavy traffic because she worked in downtown washington , d.c. and her father lived out west of the city ."
"it felt as if everyone and their brother were heading out west along interstate 66 so there were long periods when she was crawling in traffic , and those were the good moments ."
"there were other times when she just sat there , the autumn sunshine beating through her window while traffic came to a standstill ."
"this was why she used public transportation , she thought with frustration as she pulled her jacket off during one of the many sitting spells ."
"unfortunately , there was n't any way to get all the way out to the farm on public transit so she had to drive herself , inching along in rush hour traffic ."
"when she finally pulled up behind the stables , she was hot , miserable , irritated and painfully hungry ."
"she walked into her father 's cottage and dumped her overnight bag by the door , already feeling better once she smelled the macaroni and cheese scent wafting through his small home ."
"`` dad ?"
"i 'm home ! ''"
"she called out ."
"`` can you tell me what the surprise is that could n't wait another month ? ''"
"her father stepped out of the kitchen , tossing a dishtowel over his shoulder ."
"the look in his eyes told her something was very wrong ."
"`` glad you 're here ! ''"
"he said , a little too loudly , his eyes darting from her to the kitchen , then back again worriedly ."
"`` dinner is almost ready ."
"why do n't you go change and i 'll get everything ready . ''"
"rachel watched her dad carefully , noting the odd look in his eyes ."
"`` did n't you mention that you made macaroni and cheese for dinner ?"
"i can already smell it so there 's no need to change ."
"i can just dig in . ''"
"he hesitated , glancing behind him and rachel peered into the kitchen , wondering what he was trying to see ."
"when the tall man emerged from the tiny kitchen , he took her breath away and her body immediately reacted to those dark , penetrating eyes ."
"he was taller , his shoulders broader and his eyes darker , more dangerous ."
"everything about him was just ... .more ."
"she gasped at the sight of him , her eyes taking in the overwhelming presence of the man she 'd been avoiding for the past six years ."
"and she 'd been doing a damn good job if that until tonight ."
"her father shuffled around for a moment before he said , `` i 'll just go check on dinner . ''"
"and he disappeared into the kitchen , leaving her alone to face her demons ."
"`` rais ! ''"
"she breathed , her heart instantly racing , her knees starting to feel weak and wobbly ."
"she could n't believe that he was actually here , in her father 's small cottage ."
"it had never felt this tiny before but rais was so large , he actually had to duck between the kitchen doorway leading to the den area so he did n't bump his head ."
"and shockingly , he had to angle his shoulders to get through the doorway ?"
"ridiculous , she thought , trying to pull her eyes away from him ."
"it was difficult , but she finally did it ."
"unfortunately , her eyes only moved away from his penetrating eyes ."
"traveling down his body was just as bad ."
"his broad , muscular shoulders tapered to slim hips and long legs that she knew were covered with bulging muscles , just like the rest of him ."
"the man was the epitome of masculinity topped off with an aura of confidence that many , many women found fascinating and alluring ."
"she was not immune to his magnetism either , which was why she 'd tried so hard to avoid visiting her father while he was in residence ."
"she knew that rais ' father passed away several years ago , so he was now sheik rais sayyid tarif zaman , sheik of dunari , she thought in a ridiculous train of thought that left her speechless ."
"she could n't even tell him to get out since , technically , this was his cottage , his farm and all of the horses out in the stables were his ."
"he owned the farm here in virginia so if he wanted to come to his house earlier than anticipated , he could do whatever he pleased ."
"`` it 's been a long time , '' rais finally broke the silence ."
"his deep , husky voice broke through her crazy thoughts , jilting her mind into overdrive ."
"`` yes ."
"i guess it has been a few years . ''"
"he raised an eyebrow , smiling slightly as he said , `` more like six years , i believe . ''"
"he leaned against the wall and slid his hands into the pockets of his immaculately tailored slacks , those dark , dangerous eyes never leaving her face ."
"`` one might almost imagine that you have been avoiding me . ''"
"rachel flushed and looked down at her feet ."
"`` that would be silly , '' she said , hoping he could n't see her cheeks flame up in color with the dimmer light in the cottage 's den area ."
"`` how have you been ? ''"
"she asked , suddenly overcome with the need to straighten the magazines that were scattered all over the coffee table and pick up the newspapers that had been carelessly left on the floor ."
"she was nervous and wished she could just slip out the door and fade back into the darkness of the autumn evening ."
"he smiled slightly , crossing his arms over that massive chest of his while he watched her nervously straighten up the room ."
"`` i 've been fine ."
"why have n't you been around ? ''"
"she picked up and refolded the blanket that she 'd bought for her dad because he fell asleep on the couch so often ."
"`` i 've been pretty busy . ''"
"`` too busy to swing by once in a while to say hello to an old friend ? ''"
"she stopped and froze , wondering how to respond ."
"she looked up at him , then away once again , too nervous to hold that contact with his too-knowing gaze ."
"`` well , i know it 's not very far but , well , you know how traffic is around here ."
"it 's hard to get out this way ."
"and i do n't have ... well , i ca n't really take time off very often . ''"
"he moved closer , putting a hand on her shoulder to stop her frantic movements ."
"`` you 're nervous ."
"why ? ''"
"she actually jumped and took a step backwards ."
"`` i 'm not nervous , '' she countered but could n't look him in the eye ."
"she took a deep breath to try and steady herself ."
"when she felt like she had a bit more control , she said , `` why are you here ? ''"
"she looked at his firm chin or his broad shoulders , the middle of his fabulously muscular chest ... anywhere but into his eyes ."
"he put his hands back in his slacks and looked down at her ."
"rais could n't believe the beauty she 'd grown into ."
"he 'd suspected she would be like this as he 'd watched her grow up and knew that she would be beautiful ."
"but the woman standing in front of him was stunning ."
"she had a cool sophistication that was startling with a sensuality that was soft and seductive instead of being blatant ."
"her long , black hair looked like a silk wave as it cascaded down her shoulders and her pretty blue eyes revealed so much , but also hid everything he wanted to know ."
"`` why have you been avoiding me ? ''"
"he countered in a low voice so her father would n't hear them in the kitchen ."
"he 'd wanted her for so long , he could n't remember a time when he had n't ached to hold her in his arms ."
"ever since she 'd turned sixteen , his feelings for rachel had changed from brotherly affection and interest to something much stronger , significantly deeper ."
"and the older she got , the more intense that feeling had become ."
"suddenly , six years ago she 'd simply stopped coming out to his farm to visit her father , his lead trainer , and he 'd missed her almost painfully ."
"there had been times when he 'd been furious that she was n't here for him so he could o feast on her glorious beauty or just revel in her laughter and smile ."
"then there were other times when he was relieved that he would n't have to find another woman to ease the ache she always left in him after he saw her or spoke with her because she was too young ."
"but she was older now ."
"she was n't a teenager with soulful eyes that laughed at his dry humor or teased him about his arrogance ."
"she would n't be racing ahead of him on her horse , her long , slender legs holding onto her horse and her bottom bouncing on her saddle , giving his mind images that were inappropriate and leaving him hard and aching ."
"every year she 'd grown more beautiful and more interesting ."
"each visit had left him with an ache , a desire to be with her more often which he 'd had to fight with every fiber in his being ."
"when she 'd turned eighteen , it had been the hardest because she 'd continued to grow into that figure that had him dreaming about holding her in his arms ."
"he could n't count the number of times he 'd woken up in a sweat because he wanted her so desperately ."
"as he looked down into those blue eyes , he reveled in the fact that she was now old enough for his pursuit ."
"and he would have her ."
"she might resist at first , but it would be just out of habit ."
"he would show her that he wanted more from her and they could explore this attraction he knew they both shared ."
"yes , rachel would be in his bed and they could expand the friendship they used to have so that it was more , deeper ."
"he stepped closer , his nose filling up with her soft , feminine scent ."
"`` i 'd like ... '' `` dinner is ready , '' her father called out from the kitchen , interrupting whatever it was that rais was about to say ."
"rachel blinked , looking around as if she 'd forgotten where they were ."
"he 'd been about to touch her , his hand reaching out , his fingers so close to her cheek that she 'd almost felt his fingers against her skin even now ."
"she took a deep breath and stepped around rais , moving on unsteady feet towards the kitchen ."
"`` well ... thank you for stopping by ... '' `` you 're father invited me for dinner , '' he interrupted , amused that she was trying to get rid of him ."
"interesting , he thought to himself ."
"she was nervous , he realized ."
"nervous about being near him ."
"he 'd been around women enough to know that her trembling meant she was just as interested in him ."
"that and the way she 'd looked into his eyes , the soft blush that had bloomed on her cheeks when she 'd first seen him ."
"his grown up rachel was showing all the signs and he had a hard time hiding the reaction his body was having to her attraction for him ."
"he wanted to take her into his arms and kiss her , feel her against him and show her that everything would be okay , that she did n't need to be nervous around him ."
"but her father 's interruption slowed him down , gave him time to step back and enjoy this delicious tension between the two of them ."
"`` he invited you for dinner ? ''"
"she asked ."
"she looked over at her father , wondering why he would do something like that ."
"if he knew how she felt , why had he cornered her like this ?"
"but how could he have avoided issuing the initiation ?"
"if rais had shown up unexpectedly , rachel knew there was no way her father could avoid inviting rais in for a meal ."
"it was n't just that rais was her father 's employer ."
"they were friends who respected each other ."
"rachel knew that they often dined together when she was n't here , talking about the horses and the farm , not to mention playing chess together often when rais was n't entertaining the elite of washington and virginia society at the main house ."
"she sat down at the table , taking her napkin and placing it over her lap ."
"her mind just could n't wrap itself around the fact that her father , the man who knew how she felt about rais , had even conspired with her to avoid him so assiduously for the past six years , had violated her trust like this and invited the enemy to dinner ."
"rais and john discussed the various horses in the stables over dinner while rachel pushed the food around on her plate , too nervous to actually eat anything ."
"the tiny table barely had enough room for two people so adding a third person , and especially one as large as rais , made the confines beyond cozy ."
"she kept shifting her legs , trying to avoid touching his , but he would just move his legs right back so that they were touching again ."
"it was frustrating and her stomach clenched each time she felt his leg or his thigh against hers ."
"she pretended like it did n't matter , but by the end of the meal , she was jumpy and irritated with herself for letting things get like this ."
"`` you two go on out to the family room and i 'll clean up , '' her father said , picking up the plates and heading towards the sink ."
"`` no way , '' she said adamantly ."
"`` dad , you cooked dinner so i 'll clean up ."
"it 's obvious that you and rais have lots to talk about so i 'll do the dishes , '' she countered , starting to take the dishes out of his hands but he just pulled them out of her reach and shook his head ."
"he could n't look at her as cleared the table , chuckling softly at her feeble attempt ."
"`` we 've been talking all through dinner ."
"you two go out there and catch up and i 'll just finish the dishes in here . ''"
"again ?"
"why was her father doing this to her ?"
"`` i 'd better be heading back to town , '' she said instead ."
"`` but you have n't even seen the beauties , '' her father countered , looking over his shoulder at her with a worried expression ."
"`` besides , i thought you were staying overnight ."
"did n't you bring your bag with a change of clothes ?"
"if not , you know there are plenty of clothes still here for you ."
"rais , how about if you take her out to the stables see them ?"
"they 're yours anyway . ''"
"he turned back to rachel with a huge grin on his face ."
"`` you 're going to love these guys , rachel ."
"i 've never seen anything quite like them in my life , and that 's saying a lot . ''"
"rachel knew he was discussing some new horses rais had recently purchased , but the very last thing she wanted to do was go out to the stables in the dark with rais ."
"`` that 's okay ... '' `` nonsense , '' rais argued , stepping in quickly as he suspected she was too nervous to be alone with him ."
"`` go change clothes ."
"you ca n't go into the stables like that . ''"
"rachel felt like her whole body was on fire when his eyes traveled down her figure , looking at the lavender straight skirt and cotton shirt she 'd donned this morning ."
"she was even wearing matching lavender shoes which had felt so special earlier in the day , but now she just felt dumpy knowing that the women he normally associated with could afford much better , more expensive clothes ."
"outfits that did n't droop by the end of the day as this one was doing ."
"rachel bit her lip in indecision ."
"she wanted to see what were obviously new horses , but she did n't want to be alone with rais ."
"she 'd seen him in action too many times over the years , spying on him from the loft in the stables or from the rose garden , from an empty stall or in various places where she could see him with his lady loves ."
"she 'd always admired the way he would move in closer , stealing a kiss that would eventually lead to more with his expert seduction ."
"sometimes much more ."
"`` i ... '' she was stumped ."
"`` it can wait . ''"
"he moved in closer , unwilling to give her a reprieve ."
"`` are you afraid to be alone with me ? ''"
"he asked gently , forcing her eyes to look into his and reading that fear , that anticipation ."
"she could n't speak for a long moment , too stunned to hear him ask such a blatant question ."
"she sputtered , trying to jump start her brain and give him a firm set down , or just a flip response ."
"unfortunately , nothing came to mind and her only defense was to step around him and shake her head in denial ."
"`` rais , i 'm really tired ."
"i think i 'll pass tonight . ''"
"he would n't take no for an answer ."
"`` if you wo n't change clothes , you 'll just have to go out like that , '' he said , ignoring her comment about passing on the sights and taking her hand in his , dragging her out into the darkness and closing the door behind them ."
"as the night air closed around them , he slowed down and pulled her closer , tucking her arm into his ."
"`` see ?"
"this is n't so bad , '' he said and smiled down into her nervous eyes ."
"rachel tried to pull her hand off of his arm , but he held it in place and kept on walking ."
"`` you look beautiful in that color , by the way , '' he commented ."
"rachel tried to ignore the coziness of the atmosphere , the intimacy of the darkness which made everything else fade into the background ."
"`` thank you , '' she said , clearing her throat and pretending to look around ."
"`` what are you going to show me ? ''"
"`` some new horses i think you 'll like . ''"
"rachel loved horses , loved riding and just being around the strong , gentle creatures ."
"`` why are they so special ? ''"
"she asked , becoming interested despite her nervousness and irritation with his commanding attitude ."
"he opened the heavy door to the stables and they were immediately enveloped into the warmer , more humid air that kept the horses comfortable during the colder autumn and winter months ."
"`` you 'll see , '' he said with a mysterious smile ."
"he led her down to the third stall and opened the top gate ."
"`` what do you think ? ''"
"he asked and stepped back , letting her peer inside ."
"rachel looked at his handsome face filled with excitement and had to smile herself ."
"he looked a little bit like a small boy on christmas morning , eager to see what kinds of presents he 'd received under the tree ."
"she took a step closer and looked inside the stable and the sight she saw made her gasp with awe ."
"staring back at her were two of the most beautiful thoroughbred horses she 'd ever seen in her life ."
"one was pure white and the other pure black , both of them just standing in the middle of the large stall , sniffing the air in order to determine if the new scent was friend or foe ."
"when she stuck out her hand , wanting to touch the newest beauties , they rebuffed her initially , too proud to come close ."
"`` here , '' rais said and handed her some sugar cubes ."
"`` they both have a horrible sweet tooth . ''"
"she took the sugar cubes , pretending that she did n't shiver when their hands touched , then turned back to the beauties ."
"`` i thought a white thoroughbred was rare . ''"
"`` they are ."
"but this one came on sale just a few months ago ."
"there was a bidding war for him but i was determined . ''"
"as the horses approached , sniffing in her hand to see what she had for them , rachel could n't stop her eyes from rolling at his comment ."
"`` of course you won ."
"do n't you always ? ''"
"`` i prefer to win ."
"do n't you ? ''"
"he leaned against the stall , watching her as she smiled at the horses as they nuzzled her palm licking up the last of the sugar crystals ."
"`` oh , i would love to win all the time ."
"but that does n't happen . ''"
"`` what have you lost recently ? ''"
"she asked , not believing he 'd ever lost at anything in his life ."
"his smile grew slightly and he shrugged one shoulder ."
"`` nothing recently . ''"
"she raised one eyebrow at him as she said , `` have you ever lost something ? ''"
"he laughed softly and moved closer , running his hand down the black mare 's neck ."
"`` sure i 've lost ."
"i do n't keep track of those issues though ."
"i move on and figure out how to overcome that challenge . ''"
"he hesitated for a moment , then said , `` come riding with me tomorrow ? ''"
"immediately she shook her head ."
"`` i ca n't . ''"
"`` why not ?"
"you used to love to ride ."
"and i used to love watching you ride ."
"i have n't seen you on a horse in years . ''"
"she blushed and shook her head again ."
"`` i ride , '' she countered ."
"`` just not when i 'm around ."
"why is that ? ''"
"she shrugged , feeling as if he were closing in on her ."
"`` i guess our schedules just have n't been in sync lately . ''"
"`` or you 've purposely been avoiding me . ''"
"she bit her lower lip nervously and took a step backwards ."
"`` why would i do that ? ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` no , it 's really just been a crazy period in my life . ''"
"`` then come with me ."
"show me that you can ride like you used to . ''"
"`` i ca n't . ''"
"`` you ca n't ride like you used to or you ca n't ride at all ? ''"
"`` i can ride ! ''"
"she gasped , rising to the challenge he was tossing out there at her ."
"`` good ."
"then we 'll ride tomorrow morning . ''"
"she blinked and shook her head slightly ."
"`` what ?"
"no , i did n't mean that i could ... . ''"
"`` it 's settled , rachel ."
"you can even ride this guy here . ''"
"what had just happened ?"
"`` i did n't agree to ride with you ! ''"
"she gasped ."
"he moved in even closer ."
"`` sure you did ."
"i know that you 're afraid to be alone with me for some reason ."
"but it will be fine tomorrow ."
"i 'll be the perfect gentleman . ''"
"she laughed and shook her head ."
"`` i 've seen you in action , rais ."
"you 're never the perfect gentleman . ''"
"he put his hands on her hips as he moved even closer ."
"`` were you spying on me as a kid ? ''"
"he asked softly , his eyes looking at her lips ."
"she pressed back against the wall , her breathing ragged and heavy ."
"`` no ! ''"
"`` then how do you know i was n't a gentleman ? ''"
"`` i was n't spying ."
"i was around doing my chores or my homework and you just happened to be around with your ... . ''"
"she halted , not exactly sure what to call the parade of brunettes that had come through his life ."
"`` lady friends ? ''"
"he put in for lack of a better word ."
"`` yes ."
"lots of them . ''"
"she tried to keep the jealously out of her voice , but even she heard the angry tone come out ."
"`` and i really do n't want to be one of them . ''"
"she put her hands on his chest and pushed , but he did n't move , not even an inch ."
"`` what if you 're not one in a crowd ? ''"
"he suggested ."
"`` i 'm not . ''"
"he looked at her beautiful features and had to agree with her ."
"`` no ."
"you 're definitely not part of the crowd , rachel . ''"
"`` please let me go , '' she begged , looking to the right so she did n't have to look at him ."
"she was shaking everywhere and his touch was strong and firm , even better than she 'd dreamed about ."
"rachel wanted so much to be kissed by this man , to know what all the other women had experienced ."
"but she would n't be able to endure it when he moved on to the next woman ."
"she had enough trouble coming out here to visit her father ."
"if she had memories of his kiss to deal with , those visits would be even worse ."
"rais hesitated ."
"she sounded sincere but everything inside him was telling him to move forward , to test those lips and find out if she really was as soft as she looked ."
"his body was already hard and aching , wanting to pull her against him , to make love to this woman so thoroughly that she would n't remember any of the men in her past ."
"`` i have to go , '' she gasped and slipped out of his arms , relieved that he had n't been holding her very tightly so it was easier ."
"`` it was nice seeing you , '' she lied without looking back in his direction ."
"she did n't want to see him again , she did n't want to know if he was angry with her for leaving him like that ."
"all she wanted to do was get as far away from him as possible ."
"when she reached her father 's cottage , she slammed the door closed and leaned against it , trying to get her breath back after the frantic rush out of the stables ."
"`` hard run ? ''"
"her father asked from his favorite cozy chair ."
"rachel jumped and opened her eyes , looking around to find her dad ."
"`` i thought you 'd be asleep by now . ''"
"he raised an eyebrow ."
"`` at only eight o'clock ? ''"
"he laughed ."
"`` i 'm old , but i 'm not that old yet , little lady . ''"
"she sighed and walked over to the sofa , pretending that nothing was bothering her even though he 'd seen her against the door ."
"`` so what are you reading tonight ? ''"
"she asked conversationally ."
"her dad laughed softly ."
"`` are you really going to try and pretend like you did n't just come into the house like the demons from hell were chasing you ? ''"
"he paused as he took in her flushed cheeks and bright eyes ."
"she looked at him as if he 'd just spoken a scary truth that she did n't have the courage to acknowledge ."
"which was exactly the case ."
"when had her father become so aware of human frailties ?"
"he was a genius at guessing when a horse was upset , but she 'd always thought he was oblivious when it came to human interactions ."
"taking a deep breath , she pasted a smile on her face and pretended to be relaxed , letting her shoulders drop and her stance widen slightly so she did n't look like a terrified rabbit hiding from a wily fox ."
"`` the horses were beautiful ."
"how long have they been here ? ''"
"she asked ."
"her father smiled and shook his head , not letting her get away with a subject change ."
"`` what happened between you and rais ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she rolled her eyes and straightened up to get herself a cup of herbal tea which she knew her father had probably already prepared for her ."
"sure enough , sitting on the counter was a cup of peach tea brewing with steam rising from the aromatic liquid ."
"`` he just ... '' she waved her hand in the air , trying to put a description to rais that would n't reveal too much about what had just happened ."
"`` well , he was his normal self . ''"
"he paused , one eyebrow raised as he watched his daughter carefully ."
"`` he made a pass at you then ? ''"
"she coughed from the sip of peach tea she 'd just sipped ."
"when she finally had her breath back , she looked up at him and shook her head ."
"`` why would you say that ?"
"i 'm like his kid sister , you 've always said . ''"
"he rolled his eyes and dropped the magazine he 'd been reading ."
"`` have you taken a look at yourself lately , rachel ? ''"
"that was an odd question coming from her father ."
"she looked back at him curiously as she sat back down on the sofa , pretending to be relaxed when all she wanted to do was hide in her room and try to figure out what had just occurred in the stable between her and rais ."
"a subject she definitely did n't want to discuss with her father of all people ."
"`` of course ."
"what do you mean ? ''"
"`` then you have to know that rais has n't looked at you like a sister since you were about sixteen or seventeen years old . ''"
"she glanced at her father , surprised by his comment ."
"`` why would you say something like that ? ''"
"what had she missed over the years ?"
"had rais said something to her father ?"
"what was she missing ?"
"john smiled at his lovely but oblivious daughter ."
"`` rachel , that man has been interested in you for years ."
"the only reason he 's waited this long to do anything about it was because initially you were too young ."
"once you were old enough , i 'm pretty sure he would have done something about his interest , but by that time , you were off at college and making darn sure you were n't here when he visited . ''"
"with his last comment , she narrowed her eyes at him suspiciously ."
"`` did you trick me into coming here tonight ?"
"knowing that he would be here ? ''"
"he was already shaking his head ."
"`` you know me better than that ."
"i respect your wishes , honey ."
"but i do n't think you 're being very fair to him ."
"the two of you used to talk so much i was sometimes jealous of the friendship you had . ''"
"that startled her because she loved her father , never wanted to hurt him ."
"and here he was admitting that the times she 's spent with rais in the past had given him pain ."
"`` why did n't you say something ? ''"
"she asked , worriedly looking across the room at him ."
"his smile soothed her slightly ."
"`` because he was good for you ."
"you were more outgoing with his encouragement ."
"he would say you might be good at something at school and that was all the encouragement you needed ."
"you went after whatever he 'd suggested with gusto and excitement ."
"sometimes you failed and sometimes you succeeded ."
"but without his words of encouragement , you would n't even try anything new ."
"you were such a shy little girl for so long , afraid of your own shadow most times and nothing i said would change the way you looked at yourself . ''"
"`` that 's not true , '' she said , not sure if she was denying rais ' influence over her choices or how shy she was as a little girl ."
"he smiled softly at her and shook his head ."
"`` of course it 's true ."
"and believe it or not , you probably had the same , surprisingly powerful influence over him ."
"i remember the two of you arguing over poverty one afternoon ."
"i do n't even remember what the argument was about specifically but you were pretty firm about what you thought his dad should be doing in dunari . ''"
"she remembered that argument clearly ."
"it had been a hot afternoon and they 'd just come back from riding down to the creek and back ."
"she was standing in the stables rubbing down her horse and he was standing next to her , helping at times but mostly just arguing with everything she said ."
"`` so ?"
"we argued about a lot of things when i was younger , '' she said , fidgeting in her chair , unable to look him in the eye ."
"her dad smirked before he said , `` honey , you argued with rais about poverty and the next week i read about a huge shipment of school books and pre-packaged meals heading into the desert villages of dunari ."
"education levels increased in that country tenfold over the five years following your argument . ''"
"her eyes widened at his announcement and she felt weak , shaky enough that she needed to put her cup of tea on the small , wooden table beside the sofa ."
"`` that does n't mean i had the influence to change his mind . ''"
"she said that disclaimer softly , as if she were worried about speaking them too loudly ."
"john groaned ."
"`` why are you so powerfully against the man ?"
"you did n't used to be this closed minded . ''"
"she sighed and pushed a strand of hair out of her eyes ."
"`` i do n't like who he is now , dad ."
"ca n't we just leave it at that ? ''"
"her father was silent , thinking things over in his mind ."
"`` why do n't you call it a night ?"
"you look pretty tired . ''"
"she was exhausted and relieved to have a break from this conversation so she smiled and stood up quickly to escape ."
"she washed out her tea cup , grabbed her bag from the floor where she 'd dumped it earlier then walked over to her father ."
"`` good night , dad , '' she said and kissed him on the cheek ."
"in her tiny room that barely had enough room for a bed and a dresser , she got ready for sleep , then curled up under the warm blankets , ready to just lose herself in slumber so she did n't have to think about what her father had revealed to her tonight ."
"unfortunately , no matter how tired she was , she could n't find the escape of sleep ."
"she kept going over the evening , the almost-kiss with rais , her father 's comments about how rais might have steered her life , the way she 'd felt when he was close to her and made her whole body shiver with excitement ."
"she thought about the conversations they 'd had together while she 'd been growing up but too many times , those memories were interrupted by images of rais with a long-haired beauty in his arms , kissing her in the stables or wherever they happened to be ."
"she hated him for all of those women ."
"and for being so handsome and incredibly male that she had n't seriously dated any man herself ."
"she 'd dated , of course ."
"and she 'd kissed many of her dates ."
"but it had n't ever gone further than that ."
"she just could n't become intimate with a man who left her feeling lukewarm at best when she knew that just the thought of rais made her feel things that no man had ever even come close to engendering within her ."
"damn him !"
"why could n't he just stay out of her life ?"
"she 'd been doing so well !"
"she even had a man she was interested in that worked in her building ."
"as an even planner it was a bit harder to date when most of her friday and saturday nights were taken up with overseeing parties and weddings ."
"but she 'd been smiling at a handsome man in her office building , someone who was kind and made an effort to speak to her in the elevator ."
"he was nice , normal and did n't rule a powerful country ."
"in other words , he was in her league and she could have a future with him ."
"potentially ."
"chapter 2 she felt the firm lips on hers and sighed with happiness ."
"`` rais , '' she whispered , wrapping her arms around his neck and pulling him closer ."
"when she felt his hands on her waist , she grabbed his wrist and moved his hand higher , pressing his palm against her breast and arching into that caress ."
"`` rachel , '' she heard him groan and she smiled as she kissed him again , deeper , her mouth pressing against his ."
"when she felt him pull away , she shook her head and cried out for him not to leave her again ."
"with a groan , he kissed her back , hard , taking charge of the kiss and sending shivers throughout her whole body ."
"the dream was wonderful , she thought ."
"this had to be the best dream of rais she 'd ever had and it melted her mind , fizzled electricity through her toes and she wanted to sleep forever ."
"but his hand was moving on her breast and that made her ... not really uncomfortable ."
"that was n't the word ."
"it made her hot ."
"she kicked the blankets off of her and tried to cool down , but the heat only increased ."
"`` hot , '' she sighed and pressed herself against the heat , rubbing her body against his hard length ."
"`` too hot , '' she gasped ."
"rais shook his head , trying to clear it from the desire that was surging through him ."
"he pulled away , only to have her hands pull her down again ."
"`` rachel , '' he growled , not sure how to handle this ."
"she was still half asleep and , even knowing that , he wanted desperately to take advantage of her soft sighs and her sweet , warm body ."
"`` rachel , you have to wake up , '' he said and pulled his hand away from her perfect breast covered in only a thin , blue camisole ."
"she wore nothing but this top and her underwear and looked like any man 's dream woman ."
"all her curves were on display and when she pushed those blankets down , he was able to look at her slender waist , her slightly curved stomach and those hips that ended with her long , strong legs with muscles built up through years of riding and tough chores ."
"he told himself to look away , but this woman had been the subject of his fantasies for so long , he just could n't help but drink his fill ."
"she was even lovelier than he 'd imagined and he wanted to bend down and kiss her , to taste her and feel her wiggle underneath him ."
"`` do n't want to wake up , '' she sighed , and ran a hand down his chest ."
"rais caught her hand moments before she reached his erection that was pressing against his riding pants and he had to stand up and walk out of her bedroom ."
"in the kitchen , he braced his hands against the countertop , breathing hard and willing himself to regain control of his body ."
"knowing that she was in that bedroom , less than five feet away with barely any clothes on was painfully hard to resist ."
"and what made the whole situation worse was that she wanted him ."
"possibly just as much as he wanted her !"
"that was pure torture !"
"damn her !"
"why had she stayed away so long ?"
"why had she hidden from him ?"
"if she felt this way about him , she should have done something about it years ago !"
"he was furious with her for staying away , for denying them this attraction they felt for each other ."
"he 'd been aching for just the sight of her for six long years and all this time , she 'd been feeling the same way ?"
"he 'd be damned if he would hold back now !"
"he thought about last night , when she 'd turned and practically ran away from him he 'd thought she might not feel that way about him ."
"he 'd gotten the signals from her from the moment she 'd walked into her dad 's house but when she 'd run away , he 'd thought that maybe he 'd misunderstood ."
"now he knew better and she was n't going to pull away from him any longer !"
"no way !"
"all those other men she 'd had in the past ... .the men who had taught her to do those things she 'd just done to him ... .he 'd make them disappear from her mind ."
"no man was going to occupy that woman 's mind but him !"
"he heard movement behind her door and closed his eyes , reigning in that temper and the lust just in time ."
"she opened the door , pulling on her thin , cotton robe at the same time ."
"when she saw him , she yelped and almost jumped back into her bedroom , but instead , she pulled herself together and finished tying the robe closed , even clenching the neckline with one hand while she stood there in her bedroom doorway looking at him warily ."
"rachel was so startled to see rais in her dad 's kitchen that she almost dove back into her bedroom ."
"after dreaming such vivid scenes of him making love to her she felt stunned to see him in the flesh like this ."
"he was ruggedly handsome with a darkness in his eyes that always fascinated her ."
"this morning , it seemed to be stronger ."
"there was something about him that was ... .almost magnetizing her eyes to his physique ."
"perhaps she was just imagining things after that dream that had felt so ... .real !"
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"she asked , her voice hoarse and dry ."
"she needed coffee desperately , but she 'd have to go around him to reach the coffee on the counter ."
"after the dream she 'd just had , she did n't want to get too close to him , afraid of what she might do ."
"she was still shaking from the impact of that dream and her body was almost humming in anticipation ."
"rais looked at her , taking in her long legs and her messed up hair ."
"she looked like she 'd just made love with passionate abandon and he had to close his eyes or lose that control again ."
"he took a deep breath and when he opened them again , he was back in control ."
"`` we were going riding this morning . ''"
"she shook her head and backed away ."
"`` no ."
"i 'm not going riding today ."
"i 'm going to help my dad in the stables . ''"
"he put his hands on his hips , shaking his head at her rejection while his grin grew wider ."
"she was challenging him and he thought she was adorable ."
"he would win her over but he was going to enjoy the chase ."
"`` you agreed to go riding with me last night ."
"that 's why i 'm here ."
"so go pull on riding clothes and let 's get out of here . ''"
"he stopped and his smile turned lethal ."
"`` unless there 's something more interesting that you 'd rather do inside . ''"
"he paused to let his words sink in before he said , `` i 'm open to suggestions . ''"
"she gasped and shook her head ."
"`` rais , i 'd really rather not go ... '' `` too bad ."
"you either come riding with me right now , and believe me , i have a great deal of ... energy ... to work off , '' he said , using the term diplomatically because he was still in a rage about the idea of another man touching her perfect , beautiful body , `` or i 'll take that as an invitation that you want me to stand here and think of other things to do with you . ''"
"she gasped at his suggestion , her eyes wide with the possibilities ."
"but before she could go much further , he took a step towards her and she yelped before diving back into her room ."
"`` ten minutes rachel ."
"you have ten minutes and then i 'm coming in after you . ''"
"she flew into the bathroom and showered , not bothering to wash her hair because she did n't have that kind of time ."
"she did n't think rais would really come in to fetch her in ten minutes ."
"he 'd always acted like a gentleman when he was around her in the past but something told her not to challenge him today ."
"she was n't sure he was willing to offer that same gentlemanly behavior this morning ."
"that look in his eyes told her that he appeared to be a man on the edge of a dangerous emotion and she had absolutely no idea how to deal with whatever was bothering him ."
"she showered and dried off in record time , her eyes flying to the clock every few seconds to gauge her progress ."
"she pulled on a pair of old riding pants and was just slipping her arms into the sleeves of an old , flannel shirt when the door to her bedroom flew open ."
"she swung around while her fingers fumbled with the buttons , trying to close her shirt ."
"`` that was n't ten minutes rais ! ''"
"she snapped at him ."
"he chuckled and walked further into her bedroom ."
"`` i realized that you did n't have any coffee this morning so i was trying to be nice and bring you some . ''"
"he set the cup on the dresser then backed up , but not completely ."
"`` cream and sugar , right ? ''"
"he asked , crossing his arms over his chest as he waited for her to finish buttoning her flannel shirt ."
"`` fine ! ''"
"she snapped , not even thanking him since he 'd barged in here like that ."
"`` you 'll need a sweater , '' he commented when she turned around and took a sip of the coffee ."
"`` it 's cooler outside than normal . ''"
"his eyes lit on her shirt , enjoying the way the buttons gaped in the center where her breasts pushed against the material ."
"`` i like the black lace , by the way . ''"
"she smacked her hand over her breasts , knowing exactly what he was looking at ."
"the shirt was one of her older ones and she 'd filled out more than she 'd realized over the years ."
"`` go away , '' she growled and set her cup back down on the dresser with a thud ."
"she pulled a large sweatshirt out of the top of her closet and pulled it over her head before turning back to him ."
"`` my boots are n't in here , '' she said and left , leaving him standing in her bedroom ."
"rais watched her walk out of her room , knowing that she was furious with him ."
"he thought it was cute the way her eyes flashed and her chin jutted out ."
"no one ever dared to show their anger at him , afraid of losing their job or even their life ."
"with a snap of his fingers , he could have someone imprisoned for life but this slender beauty did n't care ."
"she gave as good as she got and he thought it was adorable ."
"even sexy !"
"when he walked out , he was treated to a view of her cute bottom while she bent over , trying to pull her riding boots on ."
"she stumbled and he thought about reaching out to steady her , more than willing to help ."
"she must have read his mind because she swung around and glared at him ."
"he knew he was caught staring at her but did n't care ."
"he even smiled and continued to run his eyes over her slim figure , loving the way her cheeks turned even more colorful with each passing moment ."
"`` do n't you have things to do ?"
"wars to start or villages to plunder ? ''"
"she asked as she stomped her foot one more time to get the boot fully on ."
"he chuckled at her taunt , enjoying her dry wit ."
"`` i 'll plunder tomorrow ."
"today , i 'm completely free , and ready to entertain feisty brunettes . ''"
"rachel glared at him , wondering if he 'd meant to imply the double entendre ."
"`` let 's ride , '' she said and pulled the front door to the cottage open ."
"`` i 'm not spending the day with you though , '' she argued ."
"`` i 'm here to spend the weekend with my dad so you 're just out of luck . ''"
"rais smiled and followed her out the door , enjoying the view ."
"the horses were already saddled and were walking around one of the corrals ."
"at the first sight of rachel and rais coming down the pathway her horse , dolce , hurried over towards her , eager to be reunited with her companion ."
"rachel greeted her horse , petting her and loving her , telling her how beautiful she was , her hands sliding over the flanks of the horse to make sure that the stable hand had saddled her properly ."
"her father had given her this beauty when she was fourteen and dolce was getting up in the years but she was still a really wonderful horse ."
"`` would n't you like a younger ride ? ''"
"rais asked , already knowing the answer ."
"a rider and horse with that kind of commitment would n't want to be exchanged for a newer model ."
"he could tell they were inseparable ."
"`` shh ! ''"
"she snapped at him , running her hands over dolce 's long , shiny neck ."
"`` do n't say things like that !"
"you 'll hurt her feelings . ''"
"she turned to the horse and reassured her with soft words ."
"`` do n't listen to the bad man , sweetie ."
"he 's just mean and horrible . ''"
"rais rolled his eyes , but he was amused by her characterization of him ."
"`` mean and horrible ?"
"i do n't think anyone has actually said that to my face , or even in my hearing before . ''"
"`` oh , they say it , '' she said with a grin as she walked dolce out of the corral and pulled herself up onto dolce 's back on one graceful movement before she turned to look down at him from her new height ."
"`` you just probably put them in prison for it , do n't you ? ''"
"with that , she laughed and nudged the horse with her knees and off they were down the pathway ."
"rais watched her ride away , always mesmerized by the sight of rachel on her horse ."
"they were like one , he thought ."
"both of them knew exactly what the other was thinking and it was a stunning sight ."
"rachel 's hair flew out behind her back and she barely held onto the reigns , letting them hang loose while she controlled the horse with those incredible legs of hers ."
"when she turned the corner in the path and headed out of sight , rais realized that he 'd just been standing there like a lovesick idiot while she rode away ."
"he chuckled but remedied the situation quickly by pulling himself up on his stallion , turning him in the direction she 'd just disappeared into ."
"he caught up to her easily since his stallion was much younger and stronger than her mare ."
"he did n't even mind riding behind her , enjoying the view of her bottom bouncing on the saddle as she pushed the horse to a trot ."
"they rode through their usual paths , down by the creek , up through the pastures and along the river ."
"the path had n't been used as often , but it was still there ."
"when they reached the creek once again , he pulled up beside her and gently pulled at dolce 's reigns , slowing her down until they were stopped ."
"`` why did you do that ? ''"
"rachel asked , refusing to get down from the mare 's back ."
"rais was n't having any of that ."
"he jumped down from his stallion and came around to her ."
"when she refused to come down , he simply reached up and lifted her off the horse ."
"`` i was n't finished riding , '' she said angrily and pushed her way out of his arms ."
"`` let 's walk , '' he said , ignoring her comment ."
"she sighed and let dolce nibble on the grass next to the other horse ."
"`` why ? ''"
"she asked and took several steps backwards ."
"the sun was starting to warm up the air and her sweatshirt was getting a bit too hot , but she could n't pull it off because she knew her shirt was too small underneath ."
"`` tell me about your job , '' he said and pulled a leaf off of the tree ."
"she did the same , examining the veins on the leaf as she absently walked beside him ."
"`` what do you want to know ? ''"
"he shrugged slightly as he looked down onto her shiny hair ."
"`` everything ."
"it 's been years since we talked like this and i remember how you would change your career goals about every month when you were a kid ."
"you wanted to be everything ranging from a gourmet chef , neurosurgeon or gardener who would save the world ."
"besides , i miss talking to you ."
"it 's been too long . ''"
"rachel knew he was right , but she did n't want to talk to him ."
"she did n't want to even be near him ."
"this morning felt like old times , before she realized what he meant to her and before he hurt her by being with so many other women ."
"`` i plan parties ."
"i help others figure out what they want and get it for them . ''"
"he heard the resistance in her voice but was n't going to accept defeat ."
"he wanted to get to know the woman she 'd become and he usually got what he wanted ."
"`` and do you enjoy that kind of work ? ''"
"she shrugged , afraid to give him any insight into her life ."
"he could use it to hurt her in some way so she was as evasive as possible ."
"she stopped along the path and turned to face him , squinting up at him despite the sunshine ."
"`` rais , what do you want from me ? ''"
"he leaned against a tree and looked down at her ."
"he thought of several different ways he could answer her question , but rejected each of them , deciding instead to be bluntly honest with her ."
"`` i want you . ''"
"she blinked at his response , not sure she heard him correctly ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"he almost laughed at her stunned reaction , but held back so she would know that he was completely serious about what he was about to say ."
"`` i want you , in my bed ."
"naked and calling out to me , as excited to be with me as i am to be with you . ''"
"she could n't believe how direct he was but she should have known better ."
"`` that 's impossible , '' she said softly and started walking again ."
"`` why ? ''"
"he asked as he fell into step with her ."
"`` why what ? ''"
"she asked ."
"she could n't help it , but the idea of having sex , not just with rais , but with any man , was terrifying ."
"she had a deep dread of the sexual act , afraid of the pain and humiliation of it all ."
"and sex with rais ?"
"that would be even more terrifying , even if she knew that their relationship had a future , which it did n't since rais was n't the kind of man to have just one woman in his life ."
"`` why would a relationship between the two of us be impossible ? ''"
"he clarified ."
"they were walking along a path that went in and out of the sunshine as they passed under trees , stepped over rocks and jumped the creek as the path wound its way through the woods along the border of his property ."
"she had to laugh at his question as she balanced one foot on a rock before jumping onto another , keeping her feet out of the quickly flowing water ."
"`` well , first of all , you were just talking about sex which is n't a relationship , i 'm sorry to inform you ."
"but secondly , you do n't do relationships , rais ."
"you 're not a one woman kind of man and i do n't really enjoy being just another in a long line of women in your life . ''"
"he thought about that for a moment and nodded ."
"she had some valid concerns and he could easily explain away those women , but he did n't want to frighten her ."
"he had to show her that she could trust him ."
"`` so if i were to declare fidelity to you , that would reassure you of my intentions ? ''"
"she glanced up at him , then away ."
"`` no rais ."
"we 're not going down that road . ''"
"she abruptly turned around and headed back to the horses , intending to ride back to the stables and start brushing down dolce ."
"`` where are you going ? ''"
"`` this conversation is finished ."
"i have things to do . ''"
"she heard him behind her only moments before he grabbed her arm and spun her around ."
"`` so do i , '' he said ."
"a moment later , his mouth covered hers , obliterating her admonishment for him to leave her alone ."
"she stood still for all of one second , maybe only half that time , before she whimpered and her arms went around his neck , her fingers holding onto his shirt tightly because she was n't sure what to do ."
"this seemed so familiar to her , like it had just happened a few hours ago but that was impossible ."
"she could n't help but kiss him back , feeling her body ignite as his hands moved around her waist and pulled her against his hard body ."
"she 'd never felt anything like this , her whole mind shut down from reality while he kissed her ."
"his tongue moved inside her mouth , tangling with hers and driving her more insane , heating her up even higher with a need she did n't really understand ."
"he pulled away for a moment , both of them staring at each other as if to gauge the other 's reactions , their breathing heavy and labored ."
"`` we ca n't do this , rais , '' she finally whispered , but her body pressed against his , her mouth opened to scream out but nothing happened as his head dipped down again towards her , his mouth explored her neck , her ear , finding little places that made her shiver and go crazy ."
"`` we seem to be doing it quite well already , '' he replied , his hand moving underneath her sweatshirt , then under her shirt to finally find her soft skin ."
"`` this is n't right , '' she sighed and shivered when she felt his hand against her skin , the rough calluses creating a delightful texture that she had n't expected possible ."
"`` it 's very right . ''"
"he pulled her hand down and pressed her palm against his heart ."
"`` this is what you do to me , '' he said and pushed her backwards , looking down at her the whole time ."
"`` i want you , rachel ."
"i think you 're one of the most beautiful and intriguing women i 've ever met in my life . ''"
"if he had n't stopped touching her , she might have been lost ."
"but his words did n't sound right ."
"they felt practiced and insincere ."
"maybe it was her suspicious nature , or perhaps it was just too close to what she wanted to hear ."
"but the words were like a cold bucket of water over her libido ."
"`` is that what you used to whisper to all those other women ?"
"the ones you used to bring out to your house and make love to in the stables or near the rose garden ? ''"
"she asked , her eyes focused and her hand steady even if her heart was still pounding away ."
"he lifted his head and looked down at her , trying to translate her words ."
"`` i 've never said those things to another woman , '' he replied ."
"she watched him , wondering if he was sincere or again telling her what she wanted to hear ."
"`` that 's a shame ."
"you might have made more progress in working your way through the female population if you had used those lines ."
"they 're very pretty . ''"
"she pushed away from him , standing up straight and stepping back ."
"she was relieved that he allowed her the space because she was on the borderline between just letting him continue , wanting to know what all those other women knew ."
"she wanted to feel what they experienced just once in her lifetime ."
"with this man ."
"she knew she was close to giving in , to throwing caution to the wind and begging him to make love to her despite the fears that were always lurking in the back of her mind ."
"thankfully , sanity prevailed and she took a deep breath to steady herself ."
"`` i have to go , '' she said , hurrying over to dolce so she would n't change her mind ."
"`` rachel ! ''"
"he stopped her with a word and she froze ."
"`` what happened ? ''"
"he asked , calm on the outside , but inside he was furious and confused , and in more pain from need than he 'd ever experienced ."
"she shuddered and started to turn around , but stopped and continued walking away from him ."
"`` this just is n't right , rais ."
"you 're experienced enough to get me to want you but it is n't enough . ''"
"`` what the hell are you talking about , rachel ? ''"
"he demanded , striding around her so that he was in between her and her horse ."
"`` you were right there with me so do n't even deny that . ''"
"`` you 're a very experienced lover , rais ."
"any woman would ... .feel things when you do that with her . ''"
"he smiled and crossed his arms over his chest arrogantly ."
"`` are you really going to stand there and tell me that the only reason you felt what you did was because i 'm more experienced than your previous lovers ? ''"
"she was n't exactly sure how to answer that so she went with the truth ."
"`` i can honestly say that you 're significantly more experienced than all of my past lovers combined . ''"
"that was such a stunning comment , he was actually speechless ."
"he watched , dumbstruck , as she walked over to her horse and lifted herself up ."
"with a last glance , she turned dolce towards the stables and rode off , leaving him standing by the creek watching her , wanting her painfully ."
"but more importantly , wanting to understand what she 'd meant ."
"he 'd bet large sums of money that , when he returned , she would have found an excuse to head back into the city ."
"with a self-satisfied grin , he reached for his own stallion and saddled up himself ."
"giving her plenty of time to find her father and make her excuses , he rode the long way around the path , ending up in front of his own house and calling for his butler to take care of the horse ."
"he normally preferred to rub down his mounts and ensure that they were well fed after he 'd ridden them , but in this instance , he had plans to make , calls to put through ."
"the woman thought she could get away after making a comment like that ?"
"she did n't know him very well ."
"rachel rode right back to the stables , wanting to head back to her apartment ."
"but she could n't do that ."
"first of all , she had n't seen her father in several weeks and she knew he was lonely ."
"secondly , if she ran back to the city , rais would know that he 'd gotten to her ."
"he might think her departure was proof that he had some sort of power over her ."
"she could n't let him think that way ."
"so she stayed , ready to keep her distance , but also wanting to show him that she was n't affected by him , that she did n't need to run and hide about his statement ."
"thinking that the safest place to avoid rais would be hanging around the other stable help , she unsaddled dolce , rubbed her down and then sent her out to the pasture to have fun ."
"when she was finished , she looked around for her father , saw him working with one of the vets and gave him space ."
"`` hi jim , '' she said to one of the other stable hands as she patted the horse he 'd been working with into the pasture to follow dolce ."
"`` want some help ? ''"
"she asked , taking one of the pitchforks off of the wall and moving into one of the other stalls , not waiting for an answer ."
"it was a dirty job , but the horses needed a clean area in which they could sleep and stay warm at night so mucking out the stalls just had to be done ."
"they stayed in the pasture as much as possible so they could get exercise and freedom , but they came into the stables overnight ."
"she enjoyed the worked because it was hard and made her muscles sore ."
"but more to the point , jim was a good guy with lots of funny quips about working with horse manure and pitchforks and he made her laugh , forgetting for the time her conversation with rais down by the creek ."
"she was on her third stall when she heard an angry voice in the doorway ."
"`` what the hell are you doing ? ''"
"rais demanded , hands on his hips as he watched her with furious eyes ."
"rachel spun around to looked up at him , trying to hide the shaking she instantly felt when he was close not to mention that the man 's anger was more than a little intimidating ."
"pretending that she was n't affected , she shrugged and turned away from him ."
"`` i 'm making toast , '' she replied with a ridiculous sense of humor ."
"she did n't bother to answer him honestly because what she was doing was obvious ."
"`` and you 're in my way , '' she said as she bent to pick up a dark pile of something unnamed from the corner before turning to load it into the wheelbarrow , only to find him standing in front of it , looking like he might explode with fury at any moment ."
"`` you will not be doing this kind of labor , '' he growled out ."
"he took the pitchfork from her hands and dropped it onto the dirt floor ."
"grabbing her wrist , he pulled her out of the stall ."
"`` you there ! ''"
"he called out to jim who was just pushing another wheelbarrow out of a stall several down from where they stood ."
"`` finish up in here and make sure this woman does n't do any kind of work like this again ! ''"
"jim was in his twenties and had only been working on the farm for about two years ."
"so he did n't have the kind of tenure that the other stable hands had with rais and was terrified ."
"he nodded his head quickly then hurried into the stall and took over the pitchfork ."
"she was so angry at rais for scaring the younger employee that she spun around to confront him , yanking her wrist out of his grip ."
"or tried to ."
"he was n't letting her go so she just glared up at him ."
"`` that was unnecessary and the work has to be done , rais ."
"you 're being silly because i can do the work just as easily as he can . ''"
"`` enough , '' he snapped and pulled her along to one of the recently cleaned stalls ."
"he pulled her inside and slammed the door ."
"at least he released her hand and she rubbed the skin where he 'd held her wrist while he paced back and forth in the small confines of the stall , running his hand over his face and hair ."
"`` you wo n't be doing that kind of work rachel ."
"do n't ever let me catch you doing that again . ''"
"she leaned against the wall , crossing her arms over her stomach ."
"`` why should n't i ?"
"i 'm no better than they are . ''"
"`` you are ... . ''"
"he stopped , his black eyes looking down at her accusingly before he said , `` you ! ''"
"she laughed softly at his reply ."
"`` well , i 'm certainly glad we cleared that up . ''"
"he sighed heavily and came over to her ."
"putting an arm on either side of her head , he bent down low ."
"`` rachel , you and i are going to ... . ''"
"he stopped and shook his head ."
"`` you just ca n't do that kind of work ."
"i wo n't allow it . ''"
"she rolled her eyes , trying to pretend that she was n't nervous with him this close ."
"`` rais , i need to go . ''"
"he looked down at her lips and she panicked ."
"she certainly did n't want a repeat of their embrace by the creek ."
"so in order to avoid that , to avoid kissing him like she wanted to do , to feel his lips move against hers once again , she quickly ducked and stepped out of his embrace ."
"it was only because the move was so unexpected that it actually worked ."
"she skipped over to the opposite side of the stall and smiled over at him ."
"`` rais , this has to stop . ''"
"`` what does ? ''"
"he asked , stalking her slowly , but not relenting ."
"rachel looked at the shrinking distance between them , then towards the door ."
"`` this ... kissing me and doing things to me . ''"
"`` you 're an active participant , rachel ."
"i just initiate the ... pleasantries ."
"you help me continue . ''"
"`` i do not ! ''"
"she gasped ."
"he smiled briefly at her vehemence ."
"`` come closer and tell me that . ''"
"he took two more steps and she kept calculating the distance between them ."
"rachel shook her head ."
"`` i think i 'm safer over here , '' she countered ."
"she glanced towards the door one more time ."
"he knew what she was thinking and stopped her with a simple statement ."
"`` you wo n't make it so do n't even try , '' he said with that deep , sexy voice ."
"she was smiling and did n't even realize it ."
"rais in this kind of mood was different , somehow flirtatious and she had to ignore that voice in her head that told her to just rush into his arms and throw herself at him ."
"instead , she said , `` you do n't understand the depth of my desperation ."
"it makes people do crazy things . ''"
"`` and i believe that could be said right back at you my dear ."
"i 've felt you in my arms a few too many times today ."
"i want to finish what we 've started . ''"
"`` here ?"
"in the stables ? ''"
"she asked , both horrified and amused ."
"rais stopped and looked around ."
"he had indeed forgotten where they were , his mind completely absorbed in trying to get this woman to give in to the things he knew she wanted from him ."
"things he was more than willing to do with her if she 'd just stop this silly pretense that she was n't interested ."
"while he was distracted , she took the chance and darted around him ."
"she actually yelped in laughter when he reached out ."
"thankfully , he missed her by mere centimeters and she was able to dart out of the stall ."
"she did n't stop there but continued out of the stables , wanting to find a place where there were more people to keep her safe from his hands ."
"and everything else about him ."
"just looking at the man , which she did as she turned the corner and caught him watching her as she hurried away , made her heart skip a beat ."
"she walked out into the bright , autumn sunshine ."
"she took her sunglasses off of the top of her head and slipped them over her eyes as she walked to the corral ."
"her father was working one of the new horses and she walked around to the opposite side so she could watch her dad and figure out where rais would go next ."
"she was determined to avoid him as much as possible after their first two encounters today ."
"well , three if she were to count seeing him in her father 's cottage when she first woke up ."
"on the opposite side of the corral , she watched as rais stepped out into the sunshine as well ."
"he was so startlingly handsome with those dark , dangerous eyes ."
"and he had muscles no world leader should have ."
"she wondered how he worked out and would love to talk to him about his days , find out more what it was like to rule dunari and all the problems he faced , but she did n't think he would take her questions seriously ."
"at least not right now ."
"he sauntered over to lean against the corral fence as well ."
"he took a spot directly opposite where she was standing so she could n't really miss him as she watched the horse run through some exercises ."
"the horse seemed to be showing off a bit but rachel did n't see much of the show ."
"what she saw was rais , without any sunglasses , staring back at her ."
"she knew the exact moment that his eyes dropped from her eyes to her mouth because his hand came up , one finger rubbing along his own mouth ."
"the corral was wide , but not so wide that she did n't realize that his eyes dropped once again , focusing on her breasts ."
"it was at that moment that she remembered that her shirt was too small and the gap showed off a little too much ."
"she gasped and reached down , tugging her shirt tails so that the gap was n't so apparent ."
"she glared at him when she caught him laughing at her movement ."
"and she thought she might actually hate him when his eyebrow went up ."
"curse him !"
"there was no way he could tell that her nipples had hardened while he watched her ."
"he was too far away , there was no way he could know ."
"but they had ."
"and she actually thought her breasts had swelled slightly , as if he were caressing them , his mouth lowering to taste the peaks and ... she shifted slightly and his grin widened once again ."
"was he actually making love to her in his mind out here by the corral ?"
"and how was it that she knew exactly what he was thinking ?"
"no , she gasped when his eyes went even lower ."
"she shuffled her legs in the dust , her breathing ragged as her body responded to the heat in his eyes as he looked lower , his gaze focusing on the juncture of her legs ."
"she lowered her gaze , her eyes almost unwillingly lowering to find that his erection was more apparent ."
"it was n't obscene at the moment , but she could easily distinguish the large indentation where it had previously been flat ."
"her face paled and her eyes pulled away ."
"the excitement of a moment ago was gone , replaced by the panic she felt every time she thought about the intimate act ."
"she pulled away from the corral fence and shook her head slightly ."
"she turned to the left , terrified of the evidence in front of her but too flustered to figure out where she was or where to go ."
"she glanced back slightly , but only to see his face while she walked over to say something to her father ."
"she must have said something that convinced her dad that she was okay , because he patted her shoulder and turned back to give additional instructions to the training assistant who was in the corral with the horse ."
"she hurried down the path and turned the corner around the stable ."
"when she was finally out of sight , she leaned against the stable wall and took deep breaths , forcing herself to calm down ."
"she hated the way she reacted to the idea of sex every time ."
"she was just fine with her dates up until the point that they wanted to discuss becoming intimate , but then she just shut down ."
"she 'd never had a full blown panic attack though ."
"nothing like this had ever happened and she had to concentrate to keep herself from hyperventilating ."
"perhaps it was because she 'd never seen evidence like that before ."
"surely it was just because she was so far away that he looked so large ."
"that did n't make sense , but it certainly helped her to regain her composure ."
"she walked several more feet away , then slipped back into the stables ."
"she walked by the horses who were being cleaned and even patted one on the nose , further decreasing the panic and allowing her mind to start to function a little bit more rationally ."
"she felt a bit silly now that she was away from rais and away from the power he had over her ."
"she stopped at the ladder to the loft , then smiled as she remembered climbing up into the loft and looking down at the stable workers ."
"she 'd seen so much from up here ."
"from this vantage point , she could see into all the stalls , both stable doors as well as the side doors and even her father 's office down the way although she could n't see inside of it ."
"this had been her hideout , the place she 'd come when she was hurt or angry , sad or happy ."
"she 'd brought friends up here and they 'd played cards when her father would n't let her ride any longer ."
"if she had n't been in the rose garden doing her homework , she 'd be up here ."
"it was a magical , secret place where she could read for hours and get a bird 's eye understanding of what went on throughout the day on the farm ."
"she pushed several of the spare bales of hay around , forming a sort of couch where she could curl up and watch , think about what had just happened ."
"she was so deep in thought , she did n't hear the other person climb the ladder ."
"she did n't hear rais as he stopped at the top of the loft and watched her for a long moment , contemplating her long hair with small pieces of straw sticking out on various sides ."
"he walked over to the edge and looked down into the stables ."
"`` so this is where you saw everything that happened over the years , eh ? ''"
"rachel started and twisted around , surprised to find him standing right behind her ."
"he was so tall he had to duck down slightly or he 'd hit his head on the roof of the stables , but otherwise , he looked 'right ' up here in the straw and hay bales ."
"`` what are you doing up here ? ''"
"she asked , curling up into a ball , almost defensively ."
"she wrapped her arms around her legs and stared up at him , then glanced behind him to the ladder ."
"`` do n't go trying to run out on my again , '' he said and sat down next to her on her makeshift 'couch ' ."
"`` you 'll break your neck trying and then i 'll be really irritated with you . ''"
"she had to laugh at his comment ."
"`` you 'll be irritated with me for breaking my neck ? ''"
"he raised an eyebrow at her reaction ."
"`` not a good enough threat ? ''"
"she chuckled again and shook her head ."
"`` not really ."
"irritation with you is n't anything to be afraid of . ''"
"he nodded as if accepting her point ."
"`` how 's this for a threat ... if you fall down and break your neck , i 'll have you exactly where i want you ... on your back and at my mercy . ''"
"she giggled at the image but agreed that that threat was better ."
"`` okay , i 'll stay put as long as you stay on that side of the hay . ''"
"he instantly agreed with her terms then relaxed back against the hay ."
"`` so how did you find this place ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she shrugged and looked down over the workers who were milling about , taking care of the horses or hauling in food and water ."
"for the next hour , they discussed non-threatening issues like her job , his job , politics and horses ."
"she relaxed and sank deeper into the hay , feeling as if their old friendship were back and that pesky sexual tension that always seemed to be around them now had dissipated slightly ."
"it was still there and she caught him glancing down at her breasts more often than she wanted to admit , but his eyes always moved back up to her eyes and he paid attention to what she was saying ."
"he also laughed ."
"his deep , lustrous voice laughed at several of the things she commented on and it made her feel special to make him laugh ."
"`` you sound so relaxed right now , '' she mentioned with a smile of contentment ."
"`` am i not normally relaxed ? ''"
"he asked , leaning towards her with his arm behind her on the bale of hay ."
"she shook her head ."
"`` no ."
"you 're always very serious , generally wrapped up in something very complicated . ''"
"she reached out and touched his forehead ."
"`` and you have a worry line right here , '' she said , her finger touching the line between his dark , tough looking eyebrows ."
"`` it 's very intimidating . ''"
"`` but you are n't intimidated by me , are you ? ''"
"he asked and took her hand in his ."
"she did n't even realize that he was making patterns on her palm ."
"`` yes , you 're very terrifying . ''"
"he scoffed ."
"`` you do n't act like you 're terrified of me , unless i 'm trying to make love to you . ''"
"she rolled her eyes and shifted on the hay bale uncomfortably ."
"`` which is all the time as of today . ''"
"`` do you blame me ? ''"
"he joked ."
"she smiled and pulled her eyes away from his , not wanting to get pulled into that sensuous heat ."
"she 'd been there once already today , twice if she counted her dream and it was hard to pull out of that kind of intensity ."
"`` well , i do n't blame myself . ''"
"`` if you 'd wear something other than a shirt that is too small for you , and one that draws my eyes to that black lace bra you 're wearing , by the way , then i would n't always be trying to make love to you . ''"
"her free hand reached up and covered the gap in her shirt and she tried to pull her hand away ."
"`` you 're a really horrible man , '' she laughed ."
"he tugged her hand which caused her to land exactly where he wanted her , in his lap with her hands holding onto his shoulders ."
"`` i 'm just a man ."
"you ca n't blame me for falling victim to your allure . ''"
"she thought that she might be in trouble in this position , but it just felt too good for her to move ."
"the alarm bells were ringing , but because of the laughter they 'd been sharing for the past hour or so , she was too relaxed in his company to take him seriously ."
"`` i think i 've been wrong to be afraid of you , '' she said with a sparkle in her eyes ."
"`` you 're just a pussy cat , are n't you ? ''"
"`` absolutely , '' he agreed ."
"`` i 'm completely uncomplicated and non-threatening . ''"
"she threw back her head and laughed at his blatant lie ."
"`` i think you 're actually a wolf in sheep 's clothing , trying to lure me into a false sense of security , '' she said ."
"his hand slid up her waist and he raised an eyebrow ."
"`` i think you 're correct . ''"
"she knew she was in trouble , but it just felt too good to be in his arms ."
"it was the first time she had n't felt threatened by his nearness ."
"his touch was hot , but not uncomfortable ."
"`` i 'm going to kiss you , rachel , '' he said , his voice huskier , deeper somehow ."
"her eyes dropped to his mouth ."
"she tried to form the words that would ask him not to do that , but they would n't come out ."
"she should n't want this , should be pushing him away , getting off of his lap and running as far away as she could from this man ."
"instead , her lips opened slightly , her tongue darted out to wet her lips in anticipation , and her eyes looked into his , her body already turning towards him ."
"when his lips touched hers , she gasped at the heat , the electric shock ."
"she 'd never felt anything like this and she shivered , her fingers curling up and diving into his hair while he kissed her ."
"she sighed slightly and kissed him back , unable to resist him when he was acting like this ."
"she melted in his arms , feeling her shyness slip away ."
"that irritation she normally felt when in a man 's arms was n't there either so it was a nice feeling to actually want a man to embrace her ."
"why was it that the only person who stirred her interest like this was the one man who was so completely wrong for her ?"
"he leaned over , pulling her with him so that she was on her back , leaning down in the soft pile of hay that covered the floor of the loft ."
"he could look down at her with desire shining brightly in his eyes and her fingers shook slightly , but she did n't want him to stop ."
"not yet anyway ."
"his hand slowly , gently moved her hand off of her shirt , pushing it gently to the side then his own hand moved back to the front of her shirt ."
"his deft hands slowly unbuttoned the front , his eyes watching with heat as her skin was slowly revealed to his gaze ."
"rachel was breathing heavily now , her body on fire for his touch but there was also a small warning in the back of her mind ."
"she ignored it , transfixed by the way his fingers would undo a button , then skim along the skin underneath ."
"the autumn air was too warm for a sweatshirt , but as the buttons were released , she realized how cool it actually was ."
"and then his fingers would touch her skin and she would be hot again ."
"with each button , the process reoccurred , the cool air , the heat , cool air , instant heat ."
"when he reached the button that held the fabric over her breasts , she held her breath , almost afraid of the process but he did n't stop ."
"his eyes watched in fascination as the button was released and he pushed the material away ."
"she was n't sure what to expect when he finally saw her breasts , but the sharp intake of his breath made her feel sexy and powerful ."
"unfortunately , the raw surge of energy that spiked through her when his hand covered her breast was frightening ."
"gone was that heavenly desire that made her arms almost limp with the need to have him hold her ."
"it was replaced by that fear that she always felt when a man touched her too intimately ."
"she jumped with the feeling , grabbed his wrist and held him away from her as she looked up at him fearfully ."
"that warning bell in her head was louder now and her eyes looked up into his ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"he asked , his whole body stilled when she pulled back ."
"rachel did n't want this feeling to go away ."
"maybe if she just pushed through the fear , that wonderful feeling would come back ."
"maybe she could just pretend it was n't there and she could continue on ."
"she shook her head and pulled his hand back down against her breast ."
"`` nothing , '' she said ."
"`` kiss me please , '' she begged , then reached up to his head and pulled him down , her mouth kissing him and feeling relief when he took charge , increasing the pressure and that bell faded slightly ."
"but when he shifted his weight , pressing her back and moving his legs between hers , the bell sounded loud and clear ."
"she shook her head , pulled away and rais immediately stopped , lifting his head ."
"unfortunately , that was n't enough ."
"`` i have to go , '' she gasped , scrambling out from underneath him ."
"she tripped on the bale of hay behind her , righted herself and grabbed the beam overhead to steady herself as she almost ran for the ladder down out of the loft ."
"she was holding her shirt together as she descended , barely able to steady herself on her decent , but knowing that she had to get away ."
"`` rachel ! ''"
"he called out when his mind cleared enough to realize that she was n't just shifting but running away ."
"again !"
"this time though , it did n't look like she was trying to avoid him so much as just terrified ."
"he immediately started to think that perhaps someone had done something to her , something to scare her into hating or being afraid of sex ."
"he watched with rising fury as she ran out of the stables , her fingers barely holding her shirt together as she sprinted as far away from him as she could get ."
"chapter 3 rachel sighed with relief as she pulled into the parking lot of her downtown office building ."
"she smoothed the tan skirt down over her hips , then pulled the suit 's jacket off the backseat of her vehicle , wanting to look nice for work today ."
"she had a big wedding she was assisting with this coming weekend which would really help her in the firm ."
"the company she worked for , elegant events , was one of the preeminent events firms in the city , catering to some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in washington , d.c ."
"the wedding this weekend was for a senator 's daughter who was getting married at the mayflower hotel , one of the ritziest and well known establishments in the city ."
"everyone in town was working hard to get an invitation to this event ."
"all the who 's who will be there this weekend ."
"although she was n't in charge of the wedding , being too inexperienced at this point in her career , she was one of four assistants who were helping the main coordinator , a tyrant named marissa banks who was one of the best in the industry ."
"rachel had been working long hours to ensure that her tasks for the wedding were all taken care of well in advance of the deadline marissa had set out ."
"so as she walked into the building , she was reviewing her notes , looking at all the items that would be reviewed in the monday morning meeting so that she could be able to tell marissa that all of her to-do items were completed ."
"`` rachel , you 're wanted in derrick 's office , '' the receptionist called out as soon as rachel passed through the frosted glass doors ."
"rachel looked over at lenora , the sweet and friendly receptionist who guarded the lobby area with sugar coated words , helping the clients with coffee and tea , ensuring that everyone felt like they were the company 's number one client from the moment they walked in the door ."
"rachel was halfway through the lobby area when she did a double take at lenora 's words ."
"derrick was the head of the firm and ran the agency with flair and good humor ."
"she really liked him , knew that he 'd grown this agency from almost nothing so she had a great deal of respect for him as well ."
"`` i 'm supposed to be in marissa 's meeting in ten minutes , '' rachel called back ."
"`` are you sure derrick wanted me ? ''"
"it was almost unheard of for the head of the agency to speak with one of the lowly junior members of the staff ."
"lenora nodded her head emphatically ."
"`` derrick asked for you personally , rachel ."
"he seemed very excited about something . ''"
"rachel closed her file folder and looked around as if she could find the reason for this unexpected summons in the walls or carpeting ."
"the lobby area was done in shades of white and cream colors with fresh flowers brought in every week in various shades depending on the season ."
"because fall was in full swing , there were yellows and golds this week , creating a stark contrast to the white and cream decor ."
"but even the flowers could n't provide an explanation ."
"`` did he say what this was about ? ''"
"lenora shrugged her shoulders and answered the next call , efficiently directing the call to the appropriate person ."
"rachel went to her tiny office and put her notes down ."
"she pulled the papers out of the folder she 'd worked on yesterday after returning home from her father 's cottage ."
"okay , she acknowledged to herself that it was more of a running away scenario ."
"she 'd spent the rest of saturday evening locked away in her tiny apartment vacillating between fits of anger over rais for pushing her to the breaking point and crying at how pathetic he probably viewed her after the pitiable way she 'd scrambled away from him in the loft ."
"even now , thinking about the dumbfounded expression on his handsome face when she 'd glanced back up to him from the stable doorway , she could n't believe how childish she 'd acted ."
"she looked at her small desk covered with vendor information and brochures , her computer screen with sticky notes on three sides and even her lamp had reminder notes ."
"this was not the time to work through her fear of intimacy with the fabulously handsome but terrifyingly large sheik of dunari , she reminded herself ."
"she had tons of work to do and missing anything over the next five days would be extremely bad for her career ."
"the phone by her elbow rang , startling her out of her private lecture and she looked down at the number ."
"it was an internal call and she nervously picked up the receiver ."
"`` this is rachel . ''"
"`` rachel , could you come to my office quickly please ? ''"
"derrick said with his precise , cultured accent ."
"derrick was wonderful and flamboyant and everything that a gay man epitomized ."
"and he was completely faithful to his partner , a lawyer in a d.c. firm that was powerful because of his own connections and abilities ."
"she knew that the summons had been phrased as a question , but it was much more along the lines of a command performance ."
"`` i 'll be right there . ''"
"she walked out of her office quickly , stopping by marissa 's office which was larger and much more elegant and , thankfully , along the way to derrick 's office as well ."
"because of marissa 's experience and her client list , the woman had enough space for a much larger desk , several filing cabinets and a round table with luxurious chairs surrounding it so that she could discuss plans with her clients in comfort ."
"`` marissa , i 'm so sorry to do this but derrick has called me down to his office ."
"i wanted to stop by and hand you my task list and let you know the status of each , '' she said and handed her notes to the older woman ."
"`` i should be finished with him soon although i do n't know what derrick wants me for but here are my tasks that you assigned to me last week and where each issue stands , just in case i wo n't be out before you start your status meeting . ''"
"marissa glanced down at rachel 's neatly typed notes and nodded ."
"`` this looks good ."
"thank you for being so conscientious ."
"let me know when you 're out of your meeting with derrick so i can give you the next steps for the wedding this weekend . ''"
"rachel nodded her head and left the office , nervous about whatever derrick might need to speak with her about ."
"as she walked down the hallway , she went through her tasks for the past few weeks ."
"had she missed something ?"
"or had someone complained about her performance ?"
"she could n't think of any other reason why she would be called down to the owner 's luxurious office ."
"`` go on in , '' debra said as soon as rachel stuck her head into the private area where derrick 's office was located ."
"the whole floor was done in shades of white and cream and this area was no exception ."
"the cushioned chairs were in white and gold , the tables were topped with glass and cream colored legs ."
"all the desks at this end of the hallway were glass with gold and cream stands ."
"all colors coordinated beautifully , enhancing the feeling of the agency being a strong wedding group , but the shots of color indicating that they could do much more for their clients than just weddings ."
"rachel knocked on the door and stepped in when derrick looked up ."
"`` what on earth did you do this weekend , dear ? ''"
"he asked immediately and waved for her to come inside and sit down ."
"rachel did n't want to talk about her weekend on the farm with her dad ... or anything having to do with rais ."
"just the memory of being in rais ' arms saturday afternoon made her ache all over again , followed by the painful embarrassment of running away because they went too far for her pathetically timid little mind to handle ."
"`` i went to visit my dad , '' she explained honestly , omitting the part where she had to explain that her father worked on the horse farm of one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world ."
"`` well , i do n't know what you 've done recently , but you 're now the official washington , d.c. planner for the sheik of dunari . ''"
"he clapped his hands together for emphasis and waited for her reaction ."
"when she simply sat there for a long moment , derrick took her silence to mean she was just as overwhelmed as he was hoping she would be upon the news ."
"`` and what 's even better ?"
"he has a series of parties that need to be worked over the next few months ."
"you 're going to be a very busy lady !"
"and the envy of everyone in the office , i 'm thinking ."
"this is a major coup for you ! ''"
"rachel 's mouth fell open and she wanted to protest , but the words simply would n't come out ."
"parties ?"
"for rais ?"
"that 's crazy !"
"that would mean being around him , talking with him , being trapped in his presence more often than she could endure !"
"derrick did n't notice her fear and continued talking about the events to be worked ."
"`` so here 's the current list of parties , some of them are small , intimate gatherings which should be relatively easy for you to handle ."
"the others are a bit more elaborate so you 'll need to work directly with me on those so i can help you out when you get stuck ."
"i 'll help you with vendors to make sure that all of them are top notch ."
"i know that marissa thinks she has the best in town , but i have many more contacts that can work magic when i need them to . ''"
"she was still stunned from the news , terrified of the responsibility that rais was handing to her as well as what he might be expecting of her personally ."
"she looked up , noticing that derrick was looking at her expectantly , obviously waiting for her to become a bit more effusive in her excitement ."
"her hand fluttered around her head , wondering what words she could say that could get her out of this predicament ."
"derrick would n't understand her need to maintain a very big distance between herself and the fabulously wealthy sheik of dunari ."
"distance simply was n't 'done ' in this line of business ."
"`` i 'm obviously grateful for this opportunity , '' she finally stammered out when she remembered to close her mouth and think ."
"she shook her head , her hand forming a fist as she slowly said , `` i do n't think i 'm experienced enough to handle these kinds of parties ."
"surely someone with more events under their belt should be put in charge of such an important client . ''"
"derrick was already shaking his head ."
"`` the man asked for you personally ."
"he said he 'd seen your work and liked the way you handle yourself ."
"which was why i asked what you 'd done this weekend , in case you 'd attended some fancy shin dig that i should know about , '' he laughed , as if something like that could actually happen ."
"derrick knew everything that was happening in the city and anything he did n't know about , was n't worth attending anyway ."
"`` but ... '' `` no buts , darling ."
"this is huge for you ."
"and do n't worry , i explained that you 'd never handled anything this large on your own before and he said he would help you through each step ."
"in fact , you 're expected this afternoon for a wine tasting with the man himself for the first party ."
"he 's arranging all of the travel because , and this is in his words , he does n't want you wasting time on traffic issues when you could be spending your time servicing his needs . ''"
"derrick chuckled at what he thought was an unintended pun , but rachel knew that rais had probably meant that exactly as it had come out ."
"had rais worked all weekend to come up with this list of parties ?"
"or did he genuinely need to entertain like this ?"
"she knew that , in the past , he had entertained a great deal ."
"she used to watch the catering vans and florists come and go from the main house on many occasions , had even helped out in some of the events , working with lucy to polish the silver before rais arrived ."
"this list did n't seem out of proportion , but it did seem convenient ."
"she 'd have something to say about this as soon as she called him ."
"and her first comment would be that he would have to find someone else to organize his damn parties because she was n't going to do it !"
"derrick eagerly discussed the first party , giving her suggestions on where to get the caterer , the wines and even the florist , all very irritating comments since rachel had been working up her own list of vendors that she trusted ."
"derrick simply waved her assurances aside and told her to use his vendors for these events because he could be assured of both their discretion and superior quality ."
"when she was finally back at her office , she picked up her cell phone and called lucy ."
"`` hi there , it 's me ."
"i 'm trying to reach rais ."
"any way you might be able to get him on the line ? ''"
"lucy was the housekeeper and more like an aunt to rachel since she 'd grown up without a mother and lucy did n't have any children ."
"for as long as rachel could remember , lucy had been the woman she 'd gone to when she needed a woman 's advice ."
"`` i just saw his highness pass by , honey ."
"i 'll go get him , '' she said ."
"lucy did n't have the same kind of relationship with rais as rachel and her father had , so there was much more formality between her and her employer ."
"but lucy still enjoyed working for rais and made all of his favorite dishes whenever he came to town , spoiling the man in a ridiculous fashion , in rachel 's personal opinion ."
"when she 'd been a kid , lucy 's efforts had been amusing ."
"now , with rachel 's adult perspective , she considered it just another way that rais charmed women to get what he wanted ."
"a moment later , lucy transferred rachel 's call to rais who apparently was in his office ."
"she could just see him , kicked back in that huge leather chair , his booted feet up on the massive oak desk in his office that was almost always covered with documents and contracts covering the wide range of businesses rais had in the united states ."
"`` rachel , what can i do for you , '' he said cheerfully , that deep voice sending shivers through her body even from a distance ."
"`` the helicopter is on its way to pick you up for our meeting this afternoon ."
"i hope you have some good wines for me to choose from . ''"
"her hand gripped the phone almost painfully as her anger with him welled up at his cheerful tone ."
"`` i ca n't believe you 're messing with my job like this ."
"i really do n't like this one little bit , rais . ''"
"she was furious with him for putting her job in jeopardy ."
"he laughed softly , enjoying her spitfire attitude ."
"`` i would have thought working for me was quite a coup in your line of work , my dear ."
"so what wines are you bringing me to taste ? ''"
"he asked ."
"rachel was gritting her teeth , furious that he was purposely missing the point ."
"`` do n't do this , rais ."
"i 'm begging you to leave me out of whatever you have planned . ''"
"`` i have to include you , my dear ."
"it 's the only way i can see you ."
"if things were left up to you , i 'm guessing that it will be another six years before we accidentally ran into each other again . ''"
"`` you 're right ! ''"
"she hissed , unafraid of angering him ."
"others might cater to his whims and moods but she was n't going to take it from this arrogant man ."
"`` so i 'm not leaving things up to you , '' he countered , his voice deep and husky , but firm with his intention ."
"`` i 'll see you at one o'clock , my dear ."
"we 'll have lunch with the wines . ''"
"with that , he disconnected the call and rachel was left staring at her phone with rising anger ."
"he was manipulating her and she did n't like it at all !"
"a shadow appeared in her doorway and rachel wiped the fury from her expression just in time to see a livid marissa to stand there , framed by her door and shaking with fury ."
"`` just so you know , '' marissa said with an angry voice as she stood inside rachel 's office , `` this is n't over !"
"you 're not leaving my team five days before the big event . ''"
"rachel stared wide eyed at the empty door where marissa had just stood , wondering what the older woman had been told about the change ."
"a moment later , derrick was on the phone ."
"`` rachel , could you come to marissa 's office please ? ''"
"things were flying through the gossip mills in spectacular fashion today , rachel thought as she put her phone back in the cradle once again ."
"normally , mondays were a more relaxing day around here as the coordinators recovered from whatever party they 'd organized over the weekend ."
"but apparently marissa 's wedding was putting everyone on edge with the stress of such an important event looming ."
"rachel understood marissa 's doorway comment now ."
"and in a way , it was flattering that marissa was so angry that rachel was being pulled off of the big event ."
"it meant that marissa valued rachel 's contributions and wanted her to remain on the team ."
"or it could mean that someone had gotten wind of the newest events and marissa was jealous ."
"that would n't be good , she thought as she made her way back down the hall with shaking knees ."
"as rachel walked down the hallway to marissa 's office , she could hear the yelling even from several offices away ."
"others in the offices looked up , curious to know what was happening and what the blowout fight was all about ."
"`` he asked for her personally , marissa , '' derrick was saying , leaning against the woman 's desk ."
"rachel walked into the office , standing awkwardly in the doorway ."
"`` i 'm terribly sorry about this marissa , '' she said softly , hoping to alleviate some of the woman 's anger ."
"`` i honestly did n't expect anything like this ."
"i can probably do both the wedding and this party ."
"i can work overtime to get everything done so you are n't left hanging . ''"
"rachel was taken aback by the woman 's glare , her fury shining through her eyes like nothing rachel had ever seen before ."
"`` i should be doing these parties . ''"
"marissa spun around to face derrick again ."
"`` let her take the senator 's wedding !"
"i 'll do the sheik 's parties ."
"i know international protocols much better than rachel ."
"she 'll mess things up royally and we could have an international incident on our hands . ''"
"rachel could n't believe what she was hearing ."
"all this time , rachel had been trying to figure out how to help marissa while the other woman was just trying to get the better event !"
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"rachel snapped , stepping forward ."
"her whole body language changed with the bitter woman 's words ."
"`` i will not cause an international incident ."
"nor will i even cause an office incident such as the one happening right now ."
"and as for experience , i think i can do just as good a job , possibly even better , at anticipating sheik rais ' concerns than someone who thinks it is appropriate to back stab one 's coworkers . ''"
"derrick looked over at rachel with newfound respect ."
"he obviously had n't expected his junior organizer to stand up for herself quite so eloquently ."
"`` well said , my dear . ''"
"he turned back to marissa ."
"`` as for you , if you do n't stop making a scene , i 'll take you up on your request to be pulled from the senator 's wedding this weekend but you definitely wo n't be given anything as important as the sheik 's social calendar when you do n't have the professionalism to finish your current assignment . ''"
"he stood up and started to walk out of the office but he must have eyes on the back of his head because marissa was just about to say something else but he stopped her cold by spinning around and snapping at her , `` forget it ! ''"
"before leaving the two women to stand there glaring at each other ."
"marissa looked rachel up and down , shaking her head ."
"`` well , we know you did n't sleep with the guy to get this assignment ."
"so i wonder what you did do for him . ''"
"rachel gasped , unable to believe what she 'd just heard ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"marissa knew she 'd scored a point with that statement and took on a smug expression ."
"`` you heard me ."
"the ice princess sleeping her way to the top ?"
"i 'm pretty sure that the sheik is going to be disappointed when he realizes that you do n't ... '' rachel did n't even wait for the end of the sentence before she spun around on her heel and walked out of the woman 's office ."
"she could n't believe the vitriol the woman was spewing but her other concern was that marrisa actually knew , was n't just guessing , but was positive that rachel would n't put out ."
"it was true about her clients , but the way marissa had said that made her think that she also knew that she did n't sleep with any of her boyfriends ."
"rachel went back to her office and closed the door before she let her emotions show ."
"she was so horrified , insulted by the possibility that her friends and co-workers were gossiping about her sex life ."
"or lack of it , she clarified ."
"how could they all know ?"
"or were they guessing ?"
"was it written on her face somehow ?"
"what a mess , she thought ."
"she could n't even counter their impressions because , unfortunately , it was true ."
"she had to get out of here ."
"her office was tiny and she felt as if the walls were closing in on her ."
"she hated this feeling so she grabbed her notebook and her purse before rushing out of her office ."
"she ran into several co-workers in the hallway but they all looked away , avoiding her eyes ."
"that hurt , she thought ."
"it meant that they all knew and all were gossiping ."
"either about her fight with marissa or the woman 's horrible accusations ."
"how could her sex life even become a topic of conversation ?"
"what would cause them to speculate on things like that ?"
"she dated and she had friends who she would talk about her weekends with them ."
"they all discussed their dates over lunch in the kitchen or when they went out for lunches or dinners , sometimes even happy hours ."
"and yes , several of the other women would give details that rachel thought might be a bit too intimate , but just because she did n't share similar details about her dates , that should n't imply that she did n't have intimate details to share ."
"okay , so it might mean that , but her co-workers could n't know that ."
"for all they knew , she was just being respectful , a woman who did n't kiss and tell ."
"she slumped down in her car , grateful for the dim lights of the parking garage which allowed her to pull herself together ."
"so what if she did n't sleep around ?"
"that was none of their business ."
"she did n't sleep with clients , she did n't sleep with guys that she could n't feel something for ... that was a decision for her to decide and was n't any one else 's information ."
"she took a deep breath , putting things into perspective and came to realize that it was n't that they knew she did n't sleep around ."
"it was more the fact that it was common knowledge ."
"she hated being the topic of someone else 's conversations ."
"it was just demoralizing ."
"she started her car and pulled out , driving to the address derrick had given her so she could pick up the bottles of wine he 'd selected for this afternoon ."
"she had no idea why rais wanted to test out the wines ."
"he entertained all the time and she did n't think he even cared what wines were served as long as they were of excellent quality ."
"perhaps there was something about these specific vintages that he wanted to try before serving ."
"maybe they were new or tricky ."
"she did n't really have a big taste for wine but knew from her training which wines to select for various meals ."
"at this point , she did n't care ."
"she would bill the man for every hour that she worked for him and maybe he would regret doing something so outrageous as asking her to organize his parties ."
"unfortunately , as the hour approached when she would see rais again , her nerves started getting the better of her ."
"she 'd picked up several samples of wines , cheeses and various other interesting ideas for his first party and had them stored in large boxes , ready to take out to him ."
"she did n't mind flying but she 'd never been in a helicopter before so this was going to be interesting ."
"at the heliport , she allowed the attendant to carry the heavy boxes to the waiting helicopter and she approached at a slower pace , not eager to get into the contraption ."
"this one looked significantly larger than what she was expecting , even having the dunari royal seal on the sides ."
"there were two big , burly men who were watching her approach and she suspected they were body guards for rais , but why they would be here , she had no idea ."
"should n't they be out at the farm protecting him ?"
"she knew they were always there , but they guarded the inside of the main house and the perimeter of the property , rarely venturing down to the stables ."
"the helicopter lifted off and rachel 's stomach dropped out of her body ."
"she gripped the cases of wine in her right hand and the door handle in her left , praying silently that the pilot knew what he was doing ."
"it might take her two hours to get out to the farm by car , but when one did n't have to deal with traffic and red lights , or even rights and lefts to get to the correct street , it was much faster ."
"the pilot simply flew over all the little ant sized cars below , flying directly to the farm and landing on rais ' private helipad ."
"george , one of the older gardeners , was even there to meet her and carry the case of wine and the other box of delicacies from the helicopter to the back of his truck ."
"it took less than thirty minutes to get from her office building to the main house and she was shaking the whole time ."
"rais was standing on the front of the steps , watching as george drove her up the long driveway ."
"when he pulled up at the front of the house , rais walked down the steps and opened the door for her ."
"she almost did n't get out of the truck as she gazed at his victorious eyes , filled with intent that made her stomach muscles tighten even more ."
"`` welcome back , rachel . ''"
"he took her hand and pulled her up the steps and into the house ."
"rachel had been inside often over the years , but normally she entered through the kitchen door or the garage ."
"the main house was intimidating when coming in through the front , which was exactly his intent with most of his guests ."
"`` why are you doing this ? ''"
"she asked when he brought her into the dining room where lucy already had a light lunch set out along with a whole tray of wine glasses ready for the wine tasting ."
"`` we 'll do the opening , '' he said to george who was preparing the first bottle for the tasting ."
"george nodded and bowed himself out of the dining room , even closing the doors as he left ."
"rachel saw that they were now alone and her shaking increased ."
"`` please do n't do this , rais , '' she begged , her fingers knotting the napkin on her lap ."
"`` do n't do what ? ''"
"he asked as he poured a small amount from the first bottle of wine ."
"`` do n't do ... .this , '' she said , waving her hand between the two of them ."
"he looked down at her and stilled for a long moment ."
"`` help me understand why i should n't try and make love to the woman i 've wanted for so long i ca n't remember a time when i did n't want you in my bed . ''"
"that was a startling declaration but she focused on his first request ."
"`` i 'm not in your league , rais ."
"i do n't play by the same rules that you do ."
"when i have sex , it will mean something . ''"
"that declaration infuriated him for some reason ."
"`` so all of your old lovers meant so much to you that you 're still with them ?"
"its ' just me that you do n't want in your bed , is that it ? ''"
"she sighed and bowed her head ."
"`` you keep referring to my old lovers , but that assumption is n't accurate , rais . ''"
"`` how many ? ''"
"he demanded and placed her glass in front of her ."
"`` taste this one ."
"it 's an excellent red . ''"
"she ignored the glass and stared at her fingers instead ."
"`` none , '' she whispered ."
"it was time to be honest with him ."
"maybe if he understood , he would stop his pursuit of her and let her just be content with the way her life was moving ."
"he did n't move ."
"did n't even breathe for a long moment ."
"`` would you repeat that please ? ''"
"he said softly , firmly ."
"she did n't want to repeat it ."
"she wanted to run out of the house and hide from him again ."
"being here , seeing him again as the memories of those hands on her breasts saturday filtered into her mind , she had trouble focusing on anything other than that ."
"and what might have happened if she 'd stayed , if her fears had n't come up and overwhelmed her ."
"he was n't leaving her any choice though ."
"he stood there looking down at her , waiting ."
"her chin lifted just so he did n't think she was weak or embarrassed , which she was in this case but he did n't have to know that ."
"`` i have n't been with any other man . ''"
"he sat down heavily in the chair next to her , downed the small amount of wine he 'd poured in his glass , then poured himself another ."
"`` explain please . ''"
"she stood up and took her glass of water , draining the glass as she looked out the window ."
"`` do you remember that afternoon a long time ago when i came home from school and saw devlin and dalia ? ''"
"they were two of the horses that were still on the farm , still producing excellent offspring ."
"he remembered it vividly ."
"and he remembered how horrified she 'd been that afternoon crying out her fear for the mare who , in rachel 's eight year old mind , was being brutally raped when in fact , the mare was just putting on a show for the stallion ."
"`` i remember ."
"you were n't supposed to see those things ."
"your father was pretty angry with himself that day . ''"
"she smiled , remembering her father 's white face when he 'd gotten home that evening ."
"`` he tried to talk to me about it , but i was still too shocked . ''"
"she 'd also cried that afternoon in rais ' arms , begging him to stop devlin from hurting the poor mare ."
"she 'd buried her face on his shoulder , sobbing out the pain for the female horse ."
"`` and ? ''"
"he prompted ."
"`` well , '' she took a deep breath , `` i know , theoretically , that it is n't as brutal with humans ."
"but the truth is , i have n't really wanted to find out ."
"i 'm too scared to test the activity ."
"i 'm pretty sure i wo n't like having sex rais ."
"so i 've pretty much avoided it . ''"
"he was quiet , absorbing what she was telling him ."
"when he finally spoke he was right behind her , his chest mere inches from her back ."
"`` let me get this straight ."
"you have n't ever had sex with another man because you thought that sex with a man would be like mating was with devlin and dalia ? ''"
"and no man could match up to rais ' manliness , she thought silently ."
"`` that and other reasons ."
"but yes ."
"so when you want me to give you a number , i ca n't do that ."
"nor can i be casual about sex like you are . ''"
"he pulled her closer , kissing her shoulder softly ."
"`` i do n't think there would be anything casual when i finally get you into bed , rachel . ''"
"she swung her head around , looking up at him with an anxious expression on her face ."
"`` when ?"
"not if ? ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` we will happen , my dear ."
"and it 's going to be soon ."
"but i promise that you wo n't be scared and you will enjoy every moment of it along the way . ''"
"he was thinking back to saturday morning and the way she 'd responded to his touch , begging him in her sleep to keep going ."
"yes , she would be doing that with him again ."
"very soon , he thought ."
"he dropped his hand and stepped back ."
"`` in the meantime , let 's have lunch and you can help me decide on which wine to serve . ''"
"she breathed a bit easier now that he was walking back towards the lunch table ."
"she thought it was sweet that lucy had chosen the pink roses to decorate the table and she walked closer ."
"`` these are my favorites , '' she said , touching the delicate petals of one of the perfect , pink roses with just a hint of red on the tips of each petal ."
"`` i remember the day you brought this plant here to your rose garden ."
"i was so excited to see what it would be like after you described it to me . ''"
"`` i remember the day , '' he replied with a nostalgic smile ."
"he 'd made a special trip to german to find this particular rose , wanting to surprise her with it ."
"almost all of the roses had been his gift to her , although she did n't even know it ."
"when she was fourteen years old , he 'd hired a man to find a special rose bush for her ."
"when he saw how excited she was by the roses , how she preferred to do her homework in the rose garden , he 'd built up his collection of roses , trying to find unique and hardy flowers she might enjoy ."
"`` i like the ones that have a stronger scent , but you want the ones with the most vibrant color . ''"
"rachel laughed and pulled her hand away ."
"`` i used to love just laying in the garden and smelling the roses ."
"my dad would find me lying in the dirt , homework still not finished and he 'd drag me back to the stables so he could monitor me while i finished . ''"
"rais remembered several occasions like that ."
"he would chuckle from his office window as he watched her father storm up to the rose garden , irritated that he 'd had to come look for her ."
"but she was always there ."
"`` he used to call them 'damn girly flowers ' whenever he found me over there . ''"
"she smiled at the memory and sat down at the table , pulling the linen napkin onto her lap ."
"rais opened another bottle of wine and poured a bit of the white into a glass ."
"`` i do n't really like this white , but let me know what you think . ''"
"she squinched up her nose and shook her head ."
"`` a bit too dry and tart for a dinner , do n't you think ? ''"
"`` it goes well with cheese , '' he suggested ."
"`` not everyone will be eating cheese , '' she pointed out ."
"bottle after bottle , they sipped and laughed over the various descriptions ."
"rais already knew which wine he wanted at the first party , but it was a relaxing way to spend the afternoon ."
"and he could tell that she was getting a bit tipsy , which was even better ."
"he wanted her relaxed and enjoying herself ."
"he encouraged her to eat the braised chicken lucy had made them for lunch , and they both drank plenty of water to hydrate themselves and ate bread to keep the food in them ."
"but as the afternoon continued , he stopped opening new bottles and just kept topping off their glasses with the one wine they both enjoyed ."
"rachel knew the moment that the afternoon changed ."
"the relaxed feeling shifted slightly ."
"as did rais ."
"they had moved from the dining room table to the living room with the soft , leather sofas ."
"she realized suddenly that he was sitting much too close to her and , as she looked down at her legs , they were actually across his lap , her shoes tossed to the side and she was leaning back against the cushions ."
"and he was leaning over her ."
"`` what are you going to do ? ''"
"she asked , suddenly wary ."
"his handsome , firm mouth formed into a half smile ."
"`` i currently do n't have a plan of action besides just enjoying your laugh . ''"
"he took a sip of ice water , his eyes dropping to her mouth ."
"`` you have very sexy lips , '' he said ."
"she laughed and shook her head ."
"`` you 'll have to do better than that to seduce me , '' she said ."
"when she realized what she said , her eyes widened and she started to pull away ."
"he held onto her legs and shook his head slowly ."
"`` i do n't think so , '' he commented casually ."
"but there was nothing casual about the way he was looking down at her ."
"`` you 've challenged me . ''"
"she shivered with the intent she saw in his eyes ."
"`` no , really ... i did n't mean to ... '' she tried once again to pull her legs away but his hand stopped her and his touch was so intimate that she froze ."
"`` here 's the deal ."
"and bear with me because i 've been considering this all afternoon while you sat here and looked like the sexiest woman alive so there might be a few salient points to work out ."
"but we 're going to go slowly , at your pace ."
"you 're going to learn to trust me , to show me what you like and do n't like when i touch you . ''"
"she started to interrupt but he put a finger over her mouth ."
"`` we 're not going to have sex today because you 've had too much wine , but very soon , i 'm going to make love to you . ''"
"`` i do n't want ... '' `` and you 're not going to lie to me and tell me that you do n't want me to make love to you , right ? ''"
"she bit her lip , her mind trying desperately to come up with an answer ."
"but with his hand on her upper thigh like that , and his massive chest leaning down over her but not touching , no pressure at all from that direction , she could n't form the words to deny his promise ."
"`` good , '' he said when she remained silent ."
"`` we 're going to start today ."
"i 'm going to kiss you and you 're going to help me so that we do n't go too far ."
"when the panic starts to seep in , you 're going to stop me , understand ?"
"but you 're not going to stop me by running away . ''"
"he said the words softly , slowly and seductively ."
"all the while , his hand on her thigh was moving up and down her skirt and she was painfully conscious that the material was moving higher ."
"very soon , he was going to feel the skin underneath her skirt and she was n't sure she could take that kind of enticement ."
"`` and if i panic and start to run away ? ''"
"she whispered , her hand moving to rest on top of his , stopping the movement and was relieved when he moved his hand lower ."
"`` remember ?"
"you 're going to stop me when that feeling starts to show up and we 're going to talk about it , right ? ''"
"she gasped when his mouth covered hers ."
"but this time , there was a difference ."
"rais was just as bold , just as demanding , but there was a hesitancy behind the kiss ."
"he was waiting for her , she realized ."
"and with that understanding , she felt more ... accepting ."
"she could n't say she was comfortable or relaxed because she rarely felt those kinds of emotions when she was near rais ."
"it was almost as if the excitement , the passion inside of him was leashed somehow ."
"her hand reached up and touched his cheek , her fingers experimenting with touching him ."
"she shuddered with delight now that she knew this was n't going anywhere soon ."
"she could enjoy the way he touched her , the way he kissed her and revel in the feelings without the fear or panic about what might come next ."
"she gasped when his hand slid under her silk blouse and pulled away , but the control was still there when she looked him in the eye ."
"lifting her head , she kissed him once again , her mouth opening and he immediately took the opportunity to deepen the kiss , pushing her back against the soft cushions ."
"his hand moved higher , his fingers only skimming along the skin of her stomach and ribs ."
"she wiggled underneath his hand , wanting a more intimate caress , but not sure how to get it from him ."
"and also not sure how much she could take ."
"rais lifted his head , his eyes hot with the need but his jaw was firm with the control he was holding over that desire ."
"`` here 's what 's going to happen rachel , '' he said and pulled up so he was no longer touching her ."
"`` i 'm going to take you home now and we 're not going to touch each other until we 're back at your place . ''"
"rachel was startled with that command and started to protest but he put a hand over her mouth to stop her ."
"`` and here 's why ."
"you 're wearing a silk shirt without buttons up the front ."
"the only way to progress further with what we 're doing is for me to rip that shirt off of you and view those very lovely breasts that i want desperately to see once again ."
"but if i do that , i know that will snap you out of this haze of passion you 're feeling , '' he said and even saw the desire in her eyes fade as the fear took over ."
"he sighed and sat up , lifting her with him ."
"`` so from now on , when we are together , you will wear something that buttons up the front ."
"understand ? ''"
"he commanded firmly ."
"he stood up and pulled her so she was next to him , his hands on her waist and pulled her closer , forcing her stomach to feel what touching her had done to his body ."
"`` i know that you 're afraid of what you 're feeling right now , but there 's no need rachel ."
"you 're safe in my arms and i wo n't do anything right now . ''"
"he put his forehead against hers and took a deep breath ."
"`` but stand very still right now so i can maintain control . ''"
"rachel froze ."
"she was so still she was even afraid to breathe until he lifted his head ."
"her hands were still laying softly against his chest but she would n't let her fingers even twitch , much less move along his strong , muscular chest to explore what was underneath ."
"something she was very curious to do ."
"he laughed softly and his hands tightened on her waist ."
"`` you 're not very good for my ego , my dear . ''"
"he took another deep breath then stepped back ."
"`` it 's time to get you home , '' he said ."
"`` pick whichever wine you prefer for dinner this friday night , '' he commented , taking her hand ."
"`` can you work with lucy on the menu ?"
"there will be ten dignitaries here for dinner ."
"i have to fly out tomorrow but i 'll be back in time for the meal . ''"
"`` of course , '' she said , slipping into professional mode with difficulty ."
"`` i 'll have everything ready for the evening ."
"i 'll get in touch with your assistant to get a list of the guests so there wo n't be any international incidents . ''"
"he looked down at her once again , then nodded ."
"`` i know you will be exceptionally lovely friday night . ''"
"she wished he had n't said it in quite that way , but she did n't have time to figure out what he meant ."
"he took her hand and led her out of the house and down to the helipad where he climbed in right behind her ."
"the pilot was waiting for them and they were airborne just a few minutes after they entered the helicopter ."
"rachel was n't used to this kind of efficiency and was even more surprised when they landed on the top of a building only a few blocks from her apartment ."
"the elevator ride down took them to the street level where his guards were already stationed with a team of black suvs waiting to ferry her to her apartment ."
"she was uncomfortable with how much it was costing him just to take her home ."
"`` rais , this seems like a lot of effort when i can easily drive myself to and from your house . ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` not a chance ."
"it 's a long drive and i do n't want you making that kind of a trip when you 've had that much wine or even if it 's late at night , which many of these events will last . ''"
"he stopped when they were seated in the back of the suv and looked over at her ."
"`` there 's an easy solution though . ''"
"she saw the mischievous look and knew she did n't want to hear it , but she laughed anyway and said , `` what 's your idea ? ''"
"`` just move in with me , '' he said easily ."
"she gasped , pulling back to get a better look at him ."
"she knew that no other woman had ever stayed with him in that way ."
"for that matter , no woman had ever spent the night with him ."
"at least , she suspected that they did n't sleep over ."
"he generally took them out of the house and came back alone ."
"or that was her impression although she did n't have anything to back up that assumption ."
"`` i could n't do that , '' she finally said ."
"they were at her apartment now and one of his guards was holding the door open for the two of them ."
"she went up in the elevator , awkwardly flanked by two bulky men and rais , who still towered over his guards beside her ."
"she dug into her purse , wanting to escape this crazy escort home but as soon as she pulled out her keys , one of the guards took them silently and opened the door for her ."
"the other guard stood outside , holding rachel back while the first one entered the apartment ."
"a few moments later , he came back out and nodded his head , bowing slightly ."
"`` i 'll be right back , '' rais said to his guards before he nudged rachel gently on the small of her back to get her moving inside the apartment ."
"he closed the door and turned to face her ."
"`` you 'll get used to it , '' he assured her ."
"and then he took her into his arms , pressing her backwards so her back was against the wall and her chest was plastered against his ."
"he kissed her for all she was worth , his mouth moving over hers sensuously , deeply , teasing her until she responded ."
"her hands moved up his chest blindly , feeling all those things she had wanted to touch before but was too afraid to explore ."
"she reveled in his kiss , her body sliding against his , and she whimpered with the need for something she could n't define ."
"rais pulled back with a groan ."
"he put his hands on her upper arms and stepped away from her , taking a deep breath as he looked down at her eyes that were now bright with desire ."
"he almost shook his head to keep himself from pulling her against him once again but he knew that he might not be able to stop if he started once again ."
"`` i have to go , '' he growled out ."
"he pulled a card out of his pocket ."
"`` here 's my private cell phone number ."
"call me if you need anything , okay ? ''"
"rachel reached up and took the card , her hands shaking violently after that kiss ."
"`` yes ."
"call , '' she whispered , curling her fingers around the card as she reigned in her own passion ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"his hand reached out once again , touching her stomach gently ."
"`` remember ."
"front buttoned blouse , rachel . ''"
"she could n't speak , too afraid of what might come out ."
"but she nodded her head , acknowledging his command ."
"after that , he left her apartment , closing the door softly and rachel stared at the soft light in her apartment , wondering how her life had gotten so crazy all of a sudden ."
"chapter 4 rachel surveyed her appearance in the mirror , nervously smoothing the adrianna papell gold satin material over her figure ."
"the satin shimmered along her waist and hips , hugging her breasts with a sheer , embellished mesh neckline ."
"the edge of the material was high enough up on her chest that it did n't show even the slightest bit of cleavage but the mesh teased the eyes ."
"if one were to look more carefully , underneath the rhinestones was her own flesh and she worried that the dress might be too sexy for tonight ."
"oh , it was a perfectly acceptable dress for the social part of the night but was she teasing rais too much with the neckline ?"
"she glanced back at the armani cocktail suit that had arrived yesterday by special messenger ."
"the teal fabric shimmered in the light from her bedside table and the rhinestone buttons on the jacket looked fabulous ."
"but she did n't want to wear something that expensive , or anything from rais ."
"she was uncomfortable enough with him flying her out to the party on his private helicopter , she could n't accept clothes from him as well ."
"especially a dress that probably cost a couple thousand dollars ."
"this dress was even more expensive than what she 'd planned to spend but she 'd seen it on the hangar and had splurged ."
"it had cost almost four hundred dollars , but she wanted to look pretty tonight ."
"not because she was going to see rais , or because she wanted to impress him ... .or even because she did n't want to embarrass him in front of his important guests ."
"she told herself that the only reason she 'd bought the dress was because this was a special occasion and she needed to look nice for her first big event in which she was the primary event coordinator ."
"she 'd be able to wear this dress over and over again so it was really just a good investment ."
"okay , and it did n't have buttons going down the front ."
"she accepted this part mentally , but it still made her nervous ."
"every nerve ending in her body was tingling with excitement , wondering what rais might do when she showed up with a blatant ... challenge ?"
"she smiled , touched up her lipstick then grabbed the sleek , bolero jacket that came with the dress and her matching purse ."
"when she pulled the door to her apartment open , she jumped when she spotted the two men who were standing outside her apartment ."
"`` oh ! ''"
"she gasped and stepped back ."
"`` what 's going on ? ''"
"she asked ."
"one of the men bowed and stepped forward slightly ."
"`` his highness asked that we bring you to him tonight ."
"he wanted to ensure your safety , ma'am . ''"
"rachel 's hand flew to her neck , astonished that rais would do something like this ."
"`` i do n't really need an escort ... i 'm sorry , what 's your name ? ''"
"the first man bowed again ."
"`` i 'm kadar and this is joe , ma'am . ''"
"rachel blinked and released a breath ."
"`` okay , kadar and joe , thank you for the protection , but is n't this a bit of overkill ?"
"should n't you be out guarding rais ? ''"
"the men did n't even flinch when she called their employer by his first name ."
"`` we have our instructions , ma'am . ''"
"her shoulders slumped and she looked down the hallway in both directions , worried that her neighbors would see this conversation and think someone was about to arrest her ."
"the two guards looked suspiciously like fbi agents , or at least the kind of agents that appeared in the movies or television shows ."
"`` would you mind if i called rais ?"
"i just do n't think this is necessary . ''"
"`` we are at your service , '' kadar replied , again with a bow ."
"rachel looked at him curiously , but she backed up into her apartment , closing the door so she could have a private word ."
"she pulled the card out of her purse that rais had given her earlier in the week and glanced at the number ."
"she pulled her phone out and dialed , then waited impatiently for the man to answer ."
"`` good afternoon , beautiful , '' he said as soon as he answered the phone ."
"`` what are you wearing underneath the suit ? ''"
"rachel blushed and was glad that he was n't around to see it ."
"`` rais , why are two security guards standing outside my doorway ? ''"
"she asked impatiently ."
"`` they 're supposed to escort you to my house ."
"did n't they explain that to you ? ''"
"she heard the edginess in his voice but ignored it ."
"`` that 's what they said to me , but that does n't explain why you want them to escort me . ''"
"`` because i want to ensure you 're safety , rachel ."
"i thought we discussed this on monday . ''"
"she gritted her teeth , trying to ignore her impatience ."
"`` i do n't need security guards , rais ."
"call them off . ''"
"`` i wo n't ."
"and i need you to go with them ."
"they will escort you to the house , but once you 're on my property , you 'll be safe enough ."
"now answer my question ."
"what are you wearing underneath that blue suit ?"
"or are you going to make me find out on my own ? ''"
"she sighed and looked out the sliding glass doors of her apartment , seeing the late afternoon sunshine streaming through ."
"she needed to hurry up and get out to his house , wanting to supervise the various vendors that were arriving to set up but if she did n't hurry , she 'd be late and that 's when confusion settled in ."
"knowing she was n't going to win this argument with him , she smiled slightly as she said , `` do n't worry , rais ."
"i 'm not wearing anything underneath the blue suit , '' she said with complete honesty ."
"with that , she snapped her cell phone shut and stuffed it back into her small clutch purse and walked back out to the hallway ."
"kadar and joe were still standing at attention in the hallway and she pulled her apartment door shut , twisting the lock to make sure it caught ."
"`` okay , i 'm ready to leave , '' she said with a smile , ignoring her phone that started ringing at that same moment ."
"she knew that it was rais trying to reach her about her last comment and her grin widened but she did n't take her phone out of her purse ."
"by the time she reached the elevator , she heard kadar 's cell phone ring ."
"the man immediately pulled it out of his pocket and answered it in a language she did n't understand ."
"it sounded like arabic , but it could be any number of dialects or even the original language itself for all she knew ."
"kadar spoke rapidly but she had no idea what he said ."
"by the time the elevator reached the ground level , he had shut off his phone ."
"a moment later , her phone started ringing once again ."
"she pulled it out of her purse and noticed that rais was once again calling her ."
"with another laugh , she pressed the ignore button , then dumped the phone back into her purse and stepped into the back seat of the black suv ."
"she had to wink at kadar who looked at her as if she 'd just lost her mind ."
"was she really the only person who was n't afraid of rais ?"
"well , that was n't exactly true ."
"she was terrified of the man , but for a whole different reason ."
"she smoothed the dress down over her knees and looked out the window ."
"when she felt her phone vibrate , indicating that she 'd just received a text message , she thought about ignoring it ."
"but she was n't the type of person who could do that ."
"besides , it could be her boss or one of the vendors with a question or a problem ."
"with a groan of irritation , and no small amount of trepidation , she once again pulled her phone out and looked at the screen ."
"sure enough , it was from rais and her fingers shook as she read the words , `` payback is hell . ''"
"she bit her lip as she watched the city streets fly by ."
"they came to the same building she and rais had descended from several days ago and she actually hesitated to get out when kadar held the door for her ."
"it was all well and good to pull the tail of the tiger when he was far away ."
"but in less than twenty minutes she would be up close and personal ."
"with wobbly knees , she stepped out , knowing she had a job to do ."
"this was n't a personal visit ."
"she would n't even be around him most of the evening , she reminded herself ."
"she would be supervising the vendors , looking through the meals in the kitchens , observing the bartenders and a myriad of different things ."
"she took a deep breath and stepped into the helicopter , taking a seat and nervously strapping on her seat belt ."
"what could he do ?"
"she smiled and looked out the window ."
"she had a great deal of work to do before the party began and he was n't even scheduled to arrive until a half hour before the event was to begin at which time she knew he would have to shower and change ."
"the helicopter set down fifteen minutes later and rachel already had her clipboard out and was going over the details of the party ."
"her eyes skimmed the vans lined up on the driveway , pleased to note that the florist was already packing up , the caterer had arrived and looked like they 'd been here for a while , security was setting up their own perimeter and everything seemed to be going smoothly ."
"she walked in through the kitchen doorway , intentionally avoiding the main house just in case rais had actually come back earlier than planned ."
"she busied herself with her initial checklist but kept looking over her shoulder for the man in question ."
"after two hours , she was starting to relax ."
"the caterer was finishing up with the last of the meal , the dining room was set with places for twenty people , the technician had the music all set for the evening , all she had to do was press a button ."
"wine was open , flowers were in place , wait staff had arrived and were getting instructions ... ."
"she was doing a final walk through of the dining room and living room when a strong arm wrapped around her waist , lifting her up and carrying her into the smaller library ."
"rachel gasped at the first contact , but as soon as she realized it was rais , she pressed her mouth closed , not wanting anyone else to realize that he 'd grabbed her like this ."
"when the library door slammed closed behind him and he released her from his strong grip , she spun around , intending to give him a lecture on how to treat her ."
"but the words never left her since he covered her mouth with his , kissing her hard while his hands pulled her skirt up , his knee sliding between her legs and she gasped with the intensity of desire that slammed into her ."
"he was n't satisfied with that either ."
"her bolero jacket was pulled off her arms and the zipper on the back of her dress slid down with determined hands ."
"by the time he lifted his mouth , her dress was bunched up around her waist and she was gasping for breath , her hands gripping the tuxedo material of his jacket and her eyes were closed , her body begging for him to continue ."
"`` i like the fact that you think you can tease me , '' he said roughly ."
"`` but you did n't follow my instructions rachel . ''"
"she opened her eyes slowly , her heart racing and her breathing ragged ."
"she did n't care what he said , but she desperately wanted his hands back on her body , touching her ."
"when his leg shifted slightly , she gasped , her body jerking as the electricity , and something else she 'd never felt before , sparked up along her stomach ."
"his fingers traced along the lace of her bra , one finger sliding inside to tease her already hard nipple and rachel bit down hard on her lower lip , her head falling back against the wall and she gripped his lapels harder , pulling him closer ."
"rais looked down at the woman who had driven him nearly insane with desire this afternoon after her phone call and almost cussed out loud ."
"he had her exactly where he wanted her , completely ready and more than willing for him to finish what he 'd started ."
"but his guests would be here in less than ten minutes !"
"damn !"
"a part of him thought about calling every single person and telling them to just stay away , but he knew he could n't do that ."
"he pulled her dress back up , making sure that her pretty lace bra was back in place ."
"he then smoothed her skirt back down over her hips , kissing her much more softly ."
"he heard her breath , shaky and deep , and wanted to kiss her again , to bury himself inside of her but that would have to wait ."
"`` you look beautiful , '' he said softly ."
"rachel kept taking deep breaths , hoping to somehow get herself back under control ."
"it was hard , but she finally released her hands from his jacket and stepped away from him , holding onto the back of a chair because her legs were too unsteady ."
"`` thank you , '' she managed to say , relaxing her shoulders and trying to figure out how to walk once again ."
"`` why did n't you wear the suit i sent to you ? ''"
"he asked , moving in closer ."
"he knew he should keep his distance , but she just smelled good and she felt even better ."
"she smiled , but looked away from him ."
"`` it was a beautiful suit , '' she replied softly ."
"`` i thought so . ''"
"`` but it had buttons down the front . ''"
"she looked up at him , almost laughing at the irritation that flitted across his handsome face ."
"`` and you just wanted to show me your independence ? ''"
"she took a step backwards , almost laughing when he stepped right along with her ."
"`` it had nothing to do with my independence , rais ."
"i just wanted you to know that i do n't follow orders well . ''"
"she watched him , her eyes challenging him ."
"`` and the suit was too expensive ."
"i ca n't accept gifts like that . ''"
"he shook his head as he stalked her several more steps ."
"`` rachel , you need to understand something about me . ''"
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"she asked , almost laughing for some reason ."
"`` when i give an order , i expect it to be followed . ''"
"`` and if i do n't follow your orders ? ''"
"one eyebrow went up with that ."
"`` then you have to face the consequences . ''"
"he was just about to reach for her when the doorbell rang ."
"she slapped a hand over her mouth as she watched his expression change from lascivious to disconcerted at his plans being foiled ."
"he looked down at her as he shook his head ."
"`` you think it 's funny ? ''"
"`` yes , '' she giggled ."
"he bent down low even as she leaned back over the back of the chair ."
"`` do n't forget , there 's always the end of the evening when the guests are gone . ''"
"with that , he straightened up and took her hand to lead her out of the library ."
"`` my clipboard , '' she called out , trying to pull her hand away so she could grab her information ."
"`` you wo n't be using that tonight , '' he said and pulled her back , tucking her hand into his bent arm ."
"`` come along . ''"
"`` but , i need that to work , '' she argued ."
"`` you 're the hostess tonight , '' he countered ."
"`` no clipboard . ''"
"she wanted to argue more , to explain that her job was to hang in the background and oversee the evening but he would n't let her go and george was already opening the front door to the first few guests ."
"`` good evening , senator , '' rachel said , stepping into professional mode , trying to pretend that rais was n't there ."
"the evening continued on but each time rachel tried to step away from rais , he pulled her back by his side ."
"she enjoyed his company , not having witnessed the humorous side of rais but he was incredibly funny when he set his mind to charming people other than long haired , brunettes ."
"the evening was a fabulous success and rachel was proud of how well the vendors operated ."
"they had a few questions for her , which they whispered in her ear occasionally ."
"but she was able to handle everything without a hitch ."
"the only problem was when the guests started to take their leave ."
"she had n't minded being on rais ' arm while others were there to provide a buffer ."
"but as soon as their numbers started to dwindle , her nervousness increased ."
"very carefully , while he was discussing a project one of the senators wanted to build in dunari , she slipped her hand from his arm and walked over to the door that led to the kitchens ."
"`` how are things in here ? ''"
"she asked lucy who was busy overseeing the cleanup from the caterers ."
"`` everything is just fine , rachel ."
"you did an excellent job and the food was delicious . ''"
"rachel walked over to lana , the caterer who had handled everything ."
"`` thank you so much lana ."
"this was a big night for me and you really pulled through . ''"
"lana reached up and gave rachel a huge hug ."
"`` i 'm so glad you trusted me with this job ."
"i had a lot of fun . ''"
"`` and you 're an excellent cook ! ''"
"rachel came back ."
"lana 's grin widened ."
"`` why do n't you go relax ?"
"you 've been on your feet all afternoon ."
"we 'll be finished here in about ten more minutes . ''"
"`` so soon ? ''"
"rachel asked , her voice breathy with nervousness ."
"`` sure !"
"we 're fast !"
"i have a fabulous staff who know how to get things done efficiently ! ''"
"with that , lana almost danced off , excited that her first major party for a big client went so well ."
"that left rachel standing with lucy who was huffing off to the dining room to start turning off lights ."
"rachel stood in the kitchen alone , her eyes worriedly looking around , trying to find something to do ."
"but everything was completely under control ."
"`` i need to speak with you , '' she heard rais say right behind her ."
"she spun around , almost falling with the momentum but he caught her before anything embarrassing could happen ."
"she thought he might just kiss her right there in the kitchen in front of lucy and the whole catering staff ."
"thankfully , he dropped his hand and walked out of the area , assuming she would follow him ."
"rachel glanced around , caught lucy 's eyes and cringed when the motherly woman gave her a wink of encouragement ."
"there was nothing to do but follow him ."
"this was exactly what she 'd been trying to avoid all evening ."
"she could n't be alone with him , did n't want to be alone with him ."
"`` rachel ! ''"
"his voice commanded and she actually jumped , startled by the tone ."
"he 'd never spoken to her like that ."
"with authority and ... almost anger !"
"she had n't done anything wrong except disobey what he told her to wear tonight ."
"and she did n't consider that to be blatant disobedience ."
"not that she even owed him obedience , she told herself angrily ."
"shoving through the door , she was about to confront him with his irritating , authoritative voice , but she stopped short when she looked at him ."
"he was standing in the living room , his tuxedo jacket thrown over the back of the sofa , his tie hanging down on both sides of his neck and the first few buttons of his shirt undone ."
"to make the whole image better , or worse depending on one 's perspective , he was holding two glasses of brandy in his hand , offering one to her ."
"this was at least safer , she thought as she stepped forward to accept the brandy ."
"`` thank you , '' she whispered , then moved away from him , taking a position on the other side of the room ."
"`` the night went smoothly , '' he said and sat down on the leather sofa , watching her with hooded eyes ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"`` you did an excellent job ."
"very good food . ''"
"`` i told lana that i thought it was great , but i 'll pass along your praise as well ."
"it will mean more coming from you . ''"
"`` probably not , '' he laughed softly ."
"her eyes sliced over to him , not sure why he 'd said that ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"`` i mean , everyone who was here tonight basically worships you ."
"they are all eager to do your bidding and please you . ''"
"she flushed , feeling embarrassed by that kind of a comment ."
"`` you 're exaggerating . ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` not in the least ."
"you 're a very good hostess ."
"not that i ever doubted you . ''"
"by the end of his statement , he was standing right in front of her ."
"`` you 're charming and interesting despite disobeying just about everything i tell you to do . ''"
"she could n't help the chuckle that escaped ."
"`` so stop trying to order me around . ''"
"one side of his mouth tilted up in a semblance of a smile ."
"`` it 's in my nature . ''"
"his hand slipped around her waist , drawing her closer ."
"`` what am i going to do with you ? ''"
"she inhaled sharply when he pulled her against him , his dark eyes conveying his desire for her ."
"`` maybe you could just enjoy my company before you head back to dunari , '' she said softly , pulling her eyes away from his and staring at his chest ."
"she really did n't want him going back home , she thought with a touch of sadness ."
"she wanted him here where she could laugh with him and talk with him ."
"just being in the same room with him was stimulating , although at times he terrified her ."
"`` i was without your beautiful presence for six years ."
"do you really think i 'm going to just leave you now that i have you right where i want you ? ''"
"she stopped breathing with those words ."
"`` where do you think you have me ? ''"
"she asked worriedly ."
"`` in my arms . ''"
"he grinned and took a sip of his brandy with his free hand , `` and in my house with no one else around . ''"
"those words startled her and she looked back towards the kitchen ."
"they were too far away for her to see or hear anything but she suspected that he was correct ."
"her shivering increased and she gripped her brandy glass with both hands ."
"`` would you take me home ? ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` not before i kiss you , '' he replied ."
"`` i 'd rather you did n't . ''"
"he chuckled and she felt that sound throughout her whole body ."
"`` i know , love ."
"but it 's something i have to do . ''"
"he paused to let those words sink in as he looked at her dress ."
"`` and what are we going to do about this flagrant disobedience about my instructions on your attire tonight ? ''"
"she glanced down at her dress , then back up to him with a grin ."
"`` i do n't take orders from you , rais . ''"
"he shook his head and bent lower so his lips were almost touching hers ."
"`` ah , but i like it when you disobey me . ''"
"her eyes widened and she started to pull back , but the arm around her waist was too strong ."
"`` what are you going to do about it ? ''"
"he took another sip of brandy before setting it down on the table behind him ."
"`` oh , there are a numbers of punishments i can dole out for a major infraction like that . ''"
"again , another giggle slipped out and she shifted in his arms so that her free arm was higher on his shoulder , almost wrapped around his neck ."
"`` can you give me some examples ? ''"
"she suggested ."
"`` maybe i 'll choose one over another . ''"
"he looked back at her askance ."
"`` you do n't get to choose your punishments , my dear . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"he took her brandy glass out of her hand and set it down next to his ."
"when both of his hands were free , he used one to take her other hand and place it on his shoulder ."
"`` because that would defeat the purpose of punishments , my love . ''"
"he bent low and kissed her neck , causing rachel to shiver and move closer to him ."
"she even tilted her head so he had easier access ."
"`` i need to get home . ''"
"`` not before i kiss you , '' he countered , nibbling on her collar bone ."
"`` i think you 're already kissing me . ''"
"`` i 'm not kissing you where i want to kiss you . ''"
"she was n't sure where that was , and frankly did n't want to know ."
"she loved the way he touched her , the electrifying way she felt in his arms ."
"no other man had even come close to making her feel this way and she shifted against his hard length , even feeling the pressure from his erection against her stomach ."
"the thought occurred to her that she actually wanted to hold him there , to feel him and explore that part of him ."
"she did n't feel the zipper slide down her back but when he pushed the material off of her shoulders she looked up , confused ."
"at that moment , he covered her mouth with his and all the confusion was superseded by the desire for this one man ."
"the fear did n't even rear its ugly head and she kissed him back with everything she was feeling ."
"his hand slid down her spine , tickling and teasing her ."
"her fingers had been clenching at his shoulders , but with his touch , she felt emboldened to touch him back , wanting to make him feel the same things she was feeling ."
"her arms came down from his shoulders and she slowly tested how to touch him ."
"when her fingers slid down his chest , she heard him groan and his arm tightened around her waist ."
"she really liked that and tried it again but this time , he lifted his head and kissed her hard , his tongue delving into her mouth , teasing her to participate in the kiss ."
"she wanted to push his tongue out but he captured her lower lip and bit her ."
"not hard , but enough to surprise her and her hands clenched on his chest before opening up again , running across his chest muscles once again ."
"`` rachel ! ''"
"he growled and lifted his head , shaking it slightly before taking her hands and plastering them against his chest ."
"that was n't enough for her though ."
"she let her hands slide over to the buttons ."
"she thought she was being subtle , secretive but she desperately wanted to feel the skin underneath his shirt , to explore those muscles more intimately ."
"she released one button and her fingers tentatively touched his chest ."
"but it was n't enough and she released the next button ."
"she continued to reveal additional skin , her excitement building as her hands found more freedom to explore the actual man instead of the fabric that hid him ."
"she was so absorbed in exploring his body that she did n't even realize that rais had pushed her dress down to her waist ."
"when his hands cupped her breasts , she inhaled sharply and pulled back , closing her eyes just as she 'd done earlier in the evening ."
"she could n't think any longer and when his thumbs rubbed over her hard nipples , she whimpered with the need that was pooling at her core ."
"she pressed her stomach against him , her legs shifting as her whole body searched for the undefined something that she always felt when she was with rais ."
"in fact , she was n't even aware of her hands ripping off his shirt , uncaring about the buttons or the material ."
"and when she finally had him free of that , when his hands pushed the lace bra off of her shoulder and his hands were free to roam her breast without the hindrance of the material , she cried out with the jolt , pressing her body closer to him , her legs rubbing against his ."
"`` you 're beautiful , '' he told her and bent low so that he could take her breast in his mouth ."
"when he did that , she wrapped her arms around his head while her body tried to withstand this new feeling ."
"she 'd never even believed something this intense could be real , but as his mouth suckled , his tongue laved and his teeth nipped at her breast , she whimpered again with the growing need that was swamping her senses ."
"`` please , '' she gasped and tried to pull his head away ."
"he allowed that , only so he could move to her other breast , cupping the tender globe in his hand while he teased and tormented ."
"he straightened up a moment later and pushed her dress down to her feet , then swung her around , lifting her up and placing her next to the chair ."
"with gentle , teasing fingers , he pulled the scrap of lace away from her hips , his hands sliding along her legs ."
"`` sit down , '' he ordered , then took her hands to push her gently into the chair while he kneeled in front of her ."
"rachel was n't sure what he was doing , but she did n't have a chance to figure it out ."
"because his hands slid up her legs once again , his fingers at her knees pulling her legs apart while his mouth moved back to her breasts , kissing and nuzzling , teasing her until she was pliant in his hands ."
"his hands slowly opened her legs while his mouth traveled down her body ."
"she felt his fingers slide gently along her outer thigh , then her inner thigh ."
"when his finger touched her core she jumped and looked down at him , her hands gripping his shoulders ."
"when she started to push him away , he stopped her movement with the simple expediency of sliding his finger inside of her ."
"she was so astonished at that feeling that her body jerked ."
"her hips actually pushed forward , taking more of his finger and sighing with happiness ."
"when he pulled his finger out , she shook her head , relieved when he pushed back into her ."
"he stretched her slightly when he put two fingers inside of her , but she did n't have a chance to worry about that because his mouth had already moved from her breast to that core , his tongue teasing her and she could n't believe the heat she felt with his tongue and mouth , teasing her like that ."
"a feeling was building inside of her and she could n't stop it , did n't want to ."
"as his fingers and mouth moved on and in her , she pressed against him , her body arching and pressing , shifting ever so slightly until she felt that feeling intensify , expand and then ... everything sparked out , shining and waves of intense feeling , of pleasure like nothing she 'd ever experienced or knew about exploded around her ."
"rais watched with a painful need as she experienced her first orgasm and he thought he might just die if he did n't bury himself inside of her immediately ."
"when her body collapsed , he lifted her into his arms and swung her around so that she was laying on the carpet ."
"he kissed her legs , her thighs , that juncture once again so he could enjoy her taste and smell , then moved higher , kissing her stomach and reveling in the perfection of her breasts ."
"he stood up quickly , grabbed a condom from his pocket as he stripped his slacks and shoes off before coming back down to kneel between her legs once again ."
"he wanted to stay just like that , to look at her in the aftermath of that climax , but he was in too much pain now ."
"he needed her with an intensity he 'd never experienced with a woman ."
"what was it about this slender female that drove him to such a desperate need to possess her ?"
"he did n't care at the moment ."
"he leaned over her , gently taking her lips , kissing her , teasing her , bringing her back to him ."
"the whole time , he slid his finger inside of her again , closing his eyes at the heat , her wetness and how tight she was ."
"he wanted to just bury himself in her but he knew he had to take this slowly ."
"when he felt her stirring , he replaced his finger with his erection ."
"slowly pressing inside of her , watching her face the whole time ."
"her eyes smiled up at him and her soft hands moved from the carpet beside her to his shoulders while her legs automatically moved up his leg , giving him more room , better access ."
"she shifted her hips , adjusting to him and he loved the way her eyes brightened once again ."
"but as he slid in deeper , her eyes became worried ."
"he stilled and reached down to kiss her gently , reassuring her with words he was n't even sure she understood ."
"when he felt her hips move again , he pulled out and then pushed in a bit deeper ."
"rais continued the process until he felt her barrier and stopped , controlling his rampaging need to push into her to the hilt ."
"sweat was forming on his back and forehead but he shook his head , trying to clear the lust away so he could concentrate on making this experience perfect for her ."
"in the end , he had no idea what to do to help her through this pain and it tore at him to do this to her ."
"`` rachel , i 'm sorry , '' he said , his hands diving into her hair with his elbows holding him above her ."
"she heard his words , saw the worry in his eyes and the panic welled up inside of her ."
"everything until now had been so perfect ."
"she tensed , her eyes widening and she shook her head ."
"`` no , '' she gasped out and tried to slide away ."
"`` you have to stop now , '' she cried out ."
"he shook his head one more time ."
"`` i ca n't , '' he said softly and a moment later , he pushed into her , feeling her slender body stiffen in his arms and he held still , forcing the desire away until she relaxed once again ."
"rachel bit her lip , unaware that her fingernails were digging into his skin ."
"gone was that need , that desire for the finish ."
"everything was gone except for the pain and she wanted to sob out her fear ."
"but slowly , the pain dissipated and she opened her eyes ."
"feeling him fully inside of her was a new feeling ."
"she should be angry with him ."
"she 'd asked him to stop and he had n't ."
"he 'd broken his promise ."
"but as she looked up at the man , his eyes closed and every muscle in his body trying very hard to remain still , for her , she forgave him ."
"a warmth filled her and she relaxed her hands , her legs came next and he felt that ."
"his eyes opened and he looked down into her soft , smiling eyes and relaxed somewhat ."
"`` are you okay ? ''"
"he asked carefully ."
"her smile widened and she shifted slightly ."
"`` i think so , '' she replied ."
"he let go of a deep breath ."
"`` thank goodness !"
"i do n't think i can hold off much longer . ''"
"with that , he slid slightly out of her , testing her tenderness and was even more relieved when her eyes widened with the movement ."
"several more gentle movements and she closed her eyes once again , pressing her body against each thrust ."
"rais moved so that she had the best friction , shifting slightly to get a better angle , giving her as much pleasure as he could ."
"he watched her face , trying to read if some move was better or worse but everything he did just seemed to help her get closer ."
"when he felt her tightening he increased the pace and watched with fascination as her body arched and climaxed , her whole being involved in the pleasure ."
"unfortunately , he could n't watch for too long ."
"her mindless pleasure pulled him in and he could n't stop his own orgasm from washing over him ."
"it felt as if every particle of tension was being pulled out of his body with the orgasm that swept him away with a pleasure that was so intense he could n't even think , just experience ."
"when he could move , he opened his eyes and looked around , then down at the tiny woman he was crushing underneath his weight ."
"immediately he lifted up and rested on his elbows , looking down at her smiling face ."
"even now , as she ran her fingers lightly over his back and shoulders , it felt incredibly good just to have her touching him after such a long wait ."
"`` so ? ''"
"he asked , chuckling at her delirious expression ."
"`` so what ? ''"
"she quipped ."
"he gently stood up , lifting her in his arms ."
"`` i ca n't believe we did this on the living room floor , '' he commented , shaking his head ."
"he did n't even bother to pick up their clothes , just carried her up the stairs to his bedroom ."
"`` i think you were trying to reassure me that this was n't going to happen . ''"
"he thought about that as he shouldered his way through the doorway ."
"`` that might have been in the back of my mind , '' he replied as he set her down in the middle of his huge bed ."
"`` but now that you know it 's going to happen again , what are you thinking ? ''"
"she laughed and started to pull the covers over her nakedness but he only smirked and pulled the cover out of her hands , covering her with himself ."
"rachel raised an eyebrow ."
"`` it 's going to happen again ?"
"who says ? ''"
"he mirrored her expression , not allowing her an inch ."
"`` i say ."
"and it 's probably going to happen pretty soon , my dear . ''"
"she gasped when she felt that he was telling her the truth ."
"`` oh my , '' she sighed ."
"he bent down low and kissed her neck , smiling at her response ."
"`` oh my indeed . ''"
"chapter 5 rachel woke up to the alarm clock ringing and slammed her fist down on top of it ."
"she did n't want to wake up , she did n't want to go to work and she definitely did n't want to spend the week without rais ."
"she 'd spent the weekend with him , feeling awkward when she went to visit her father in the stables saturday morning ."
"he did n't even blink an eye when she wandered into the stall though and she wondered what he was thinking ."
"had rais already discussed his plans ?"
"somehow that made the whole thing sound premeditated and she did n't like that ."
"but the weekend turned out to be a great deal of fun ."
"they went riding , had lunch with her father , dinner alone at the main house and she spent the whole weekend curled up in his arms ."
"she did n't go home until sunday evening , at which time , he 'd come back with her , even coming into her apartment and made love to her one more time in her own bed before he left her to return to dunari for meetings ."
"the only good part was that she would have a chance to see him again this weekend when he returned for another dinner party on friday night and he 'd even asked her to accompany him to an embassy ball on saturday night so it looked like she 'd get to spend the next weekend with him again ."
"that thought had her rolling over in her bed , smiling up at the ceiling ."
"she was eager to see him and be with him ."
"that probably was n't the safest thing , she told herself ."
"but she pushed those reservations to the side , sweeping the covers off of her so she could start her day ."
"the week was long and tedious , but by wednesday evening , she was eagerly preparing his house for his dinner party ."
"there would be more people this time , with his whole house filled with guests ."
"she 'd even had to order a white tent for the backyard in order to hold more guests for the dinner and dancing he had planned ."
"her phone beside her elbow rang and she looked at the number ."
"thankfully it was just lenora so she picked it up ."
"`` hi , what 's up ? ''"
"she asked cheerfully but was still sifting through all the notes on her desk ."
"`` there are two big , beautiful boxes here that were just delivered for you , '' the receptionist explained ."
"rachel was confused ."
"she looked at her calendar , trying to see if she was expecting something for the party that she 'd forgotten about ."
"`` what are they ? ''"
"she asked , confirming that she had n't forgotten anything ."
"everything was supposed to be delivered to the farm so she could n't imagine anything coming here ."
"rachel told her she 'd be right there and hung up the phone ."
"picking up her notebook where she kept all the information on her events , she walked to the lobby , confused about what might have been delivered here accidentally ."
"when she reached the lobby , she saw the huge boxes with a giant ribbon on the front ."
"both boxes were long and flat with an exclusive department store label on the outside ."
"`` these look exciting ! ''"
"lenora was saying ."
"`` open them here so i can see , okay ? ''"
"rachel smiled slightly but shook her head ."
"`` i have no idea what these are but i 'd better get them out of here ."
"you know how derrick prefers his reception area to look nice and tidy . ''"
"lenora frowned , but knew that rachel was correct ."
"it was her job to get deliveries out of the reception area quickly so the white lines and punches of color were undisturbed by extraneous trash ."
"rachel carried the boxes back to her tiny office , ignoring the curious stares of her co-workers ."
"when she untied the ribbons and pulled off the top of the first box , her reaction was total stunned surprise ."
"`` goodness , '' she whispered in awe ."
"lifting up the material , she was shocked by the incredible dress that was wrapped in tissue paper ."
"it was a stunning emilio pucci evening gown done completely in black lace with an under dress of shimmering gold ."
"the dress would hug her figure from her shoulders to mid-thigh and then it flared out to her toes ."
"it was so beautiful she could n't believe that she was actually holding such a masterpiece ."
"she heard someone gasp from her doorway and looked up ."
"`` is that an emilio pucci ? ''"
"linda whispered with reverence ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"it was just delivered . ''"
"linda , one of the other junior coordinators that rachel occasionally had lunch with , stepped into her office and touched the black lace ."
"`` how can you afford something like this on our salary ?"
"it 's something like four thousand dollars ! ''"
"rachel 's eyes snapped up to her friend 's ."
"`` are you serious ? ''"
"she gasped ."
"linda only nodded , her eyes remaining on the gown ."
"`` positive ."
"i was looking at it just last weekend , drooling over the dress . ''"
"she glanced up with eagerness ."
"`` what 's in the other one ? ''"
"she asked , almost whispering ."
"rachel carefully tucked the black lace dress back into the box , gently covering it with the tissue paper before pulling the second box forward ."
"when she opened this one , she felt as if her eyes were going to pop out of her head ."
"the akris gown was almost too beautiful to touch ."
"it was a bodice cut made up in glowing pink silk that would hug her chest , skim along her hips and then flare out to the floor ."
"`` well , that one is n't four thousand , '' linda sighed , her fingers delicately touching the material ."
"`` thank goodness , '' rachel replied , almost afraid to pull it out of the box but linda 's reassurance had her taking it gently and holding it up to her ."
"`` i did n't even drool over that one ."
"it was in a glass case at the store ."
"i think it was closer to twelve thousand dollars , '' she explained ."
"`` that kind of dress is so out of my league i did n't dare get close to it . ''"
"rachel almost dropped the dress with the news that the one dress could cost so much money ."
"she was n't even sure she made half that much in a month !"
"`` who sent you these ? ''"
"linda asked , moving forward to peek into the box ."
"rachel did the same , spotting the card as she shuffled the tissue to pull it out of the box ."
"her fingers were shaking as she opened the envelope ."
"she had a suspicion on who sent these dresses and she was almost dreading having those suspicions confirmed ."
"but as soon as she read the note her heart sank with the confirmation that rais had sent both of them to her ."
"`` ca n't wait to see you in these , '' linda said , reading the note over rachel 's shoulder ."
"`` who is 'r ' ? ''"
"rachel was so furious that he thought it was okay to buy her things like this that she wanted to stomp her feet ."
"how dare he treat her like a mistress !"
"`` just a jerk , '' rachel replied angrily and shoved the envelope back into the box ."
"she wanted to do the same with the dresses , but the expense of both made her treat the dresses with more care ."
"`` they are definitely going back . ''"
"`` you 're kidding , right ? ''"
"linda asked , watching her friend with amazement ."
"`` i 'm not kidding at all , '' she said and closed the box ."
"`` i 'm not for sale ! ''"
"linda walked out of the office , shaking her head at rachel 's attitude ."
"`` if you do n't want the guy , let him know that i 'm definitely for sale for those kinds of gifts . ''"
"rachel barely heard her ."
"she was too busy digging her cell phone out of her purse and dialing the phone number rais had given to her ."
"unfortunately , the call went to his voice mail and she had to ignore the shiver of excitement that tore through her when she heard his deep voice telling her to leave a message ."
"`` rais , i refuse to be treated like this ! ''"
"she said as her message ."
"`` i 'm sending them back and please do n't ever do that again ! ''"
"she ended the call and tried to hold back the tears ."
"she packed up the boxes then picked them both up as well as her purse ."
"she stormed out of the office with the dresses in her arms telling lenora that she was going out for lunch ."
"she was driving out of the parking garage when his call came back so she pulled over and took the call ."
"`` what 's wrong , beautiful ? ''"
"he asked softly ."
"she squeezed her eyes closed as the humiliation washed over her ."
"`` why did you do this ? ''"
"she asked , her voice sounding funny even to her ears ."
"`` do what , love ? ''"
"she ignored the insincere endearment and focused on trying to see through the tears ."
"`` the dresses , rais !"
"why did you buy me the dresses ? ''"
"`` ah , '' he replied , finally understanding ."
"`` i knew that you would be with me for the two events this weekend and i did n't want you to have to worry about spending your money on dresses when you are helping me ."
"was it so wrong to buy something beautiful for you ? ''"
"`` yes ! ''"
"she stated emphatically ."
"`` i do n't understand , rachel ."
"but let 's talk about it this weekend , okay ?"
"i have to go to another meeting . ''"
"`` that 's fine but i 'll be wearing my own clothes . ''"
"he paused slightly with her declaration ."
"`` i would love to see you in the dresses i sent you ."
"i picked them out myself . ''"
"that hurt and she squeezed her eyes shut , uncaring that her mascara would probably be a mess after this conversation ."
"`` i 'm not for sale , rais , '' she said softly ."
"`` i never thought you were , rachel . ''"
"`` you ca n't buy me with expensive dresses . ''"
"`` i was n't trying to , honey ."
"i just thought you would look pretty in those and i wanted to do something nice for you . ''"
"he paused to let that sink in before he said , `` could you look at it slightly differently ?"
"i was thinking about you and wanted to show you ."
"i chose those dresses out of several other options because i thought they were something you would like and would look lovely on you . ''"
"put that way , it did n't sound so bad ."
"it was even a nice sentiment ."
"`` dammit rais ! ''"
"he laughed softly ."
"`` does that mean you 're going to keep the dresses ? ''"
"`` not necessarily . ''"
"`` well , that 's at least an improvement from sixty seconds ago , '' he replied dryly ."
"`` you ca n't do this kind of stuff . ''"
"`` why not ?"
"it 's my money and i want to spend it on you ."
"what 's the problem ? ''"
"she took a deep breath and let it out slowly ."
"`` because it 's just not fair ."
"i ca n't do anything along these lines and i feel ... .like i owe you now . ''"
"`` do n't even think like that , rachel ."
"you do n't owe me anything ."
"i just wanted you to know that i think you 're as beautiful as the dresses ."
"more so actually . ''"
"she dropped her head on the steering wheel ."
"`` you 're incorrigible . ''"
"`` i know ."
"so will you wear them this weekend ? ''"
"`` no . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` because they cost too much . ''"
"`` not for me , '' he came back ."
"she was silent for a long moment while she tried to come up with a response ."
"`` rais ... '' she started to say but he interrupted her ."
"`` rachel , let 's talk about this when i can see your face ."
"i would love to see you in those dresses , or more specifically , i would love to take you out of those dresses , slowly and with a great attention to detail ."
"but if you have something else you would like me to take off of you , i 'm more than willing to compromise . ''"
"she was about to contradict him before he ended in that manner ."
"it was so typical of him that she could n't help but laugh despite her frustration with his high handed manner ."
"`` you 're incorrigible , '' she came back ."
"`` yes , but you want me . ''"
"she laughed again and wiped her eyes ."
"`` i 'm promising nothing . ''"
"`` promise me that you 'll spend the weekend with me again . ''"
"`` no ."
"you deserve to wait and wonder after this stunt . ''"
"`` why is giving you a nice dress or two a stunt ? ''"
"she sighed and rolled her eyes at his obtuseness ."
"`` first of all , because you delivered those dresses to my office and now everyone is gossiping about me , probably assuming that i 'm sleeping with a client . ''"
"`` you are sleeping with a client , '' he came back ."
"`` i have slept with a client , but that might not ever happen again . ''"
"his laugh was deep and sexy and she could just picture him leaning back against a big , leather chair like the one in his office at the main house , his feet propped up on his desk as he smiled that handsome smile of his that never failed to make her stomach quiver in anticipation ."
"`` i 'd like to see you try and resist me now that you know what an incredible lover i am . ''"
"that comment caused her amusement to dissipate ."
"it reminded her that this man had a great deal of experience and she hated the thought of him with other women ."
"especially the women she 'd seen him with in the past because they all looked like her ."
"`` let 's talk this weekend , '' she said , all humor gone from her tone ."
"`` that sounds ominous ."
"what just happened rachel ? ''"
"he asked , much more alert ."
"she sighed and shook her head ."
"`` like you said , it 's hard to talk when you 're thousands of miles away , '' she replied ."
"he sighed as well ."
"`` okay ."
"i 'll get there as soon as i can ."
"but next weekend , we do n't have any events , right ? ''"
"`` you have n't scheduled anything , '' she replied cautiously ."
"`` did you want something on the calendar ? ''"
"she felt herself tensing , worried that she would n't see him if he did n't have a social obligation here ."
"that did n't sit well with her , even though she 'd just been upset about him and the women he had been with in the past , and those he most likely would be with in the future ."
"`` i was thinking that maybe you could come out to visit me this time around ."
"i would love to show you my home . ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` you mean your palace ? ''"
"`` whatever you want to call it ."
"i only occupy a portion of the building in which i work ."
"there 's more than a residence here . ''"
"`` but you 're the ruler so most of it is reserved for your personal use , is n't it ? ''"
"he hesitated ."
"`` why do n't you come out next weekend and i can show you everything . ''"
"she thought about it for a moment , biting her lip nervously ."
"`` rais ... '' `` do n't say no ."
"just think about it ."
"we 'll add it to the numerous other topics we need to discuss this weekend , okay ? ''"
"she released her lip and stared up at the roof of her car ."
"this was a painfully complicated relationship ."
"`` okay ."
"i 'll see you friday . ''"
"`` i 'll be there as soon as i can . ''"
"`` okay ."
"i lo ... . ''"
"she started to say something , then stopped herself , shocked at what she was about to say ."
"`` see you soon . ''"
"she pressed the end button quickly , not sure if he 'd caught her comment ."
"she stared at her phone , wanting to text him and tell him that she had n't been about to say 'love ' but she did n't want to get into that ."
"a moment later , she received a text from him ."
"all it said was , 'back at you ' ."
"what did that mean ?"
"what was coming back to her ?"
"was he teasing her about her almost 'love ' comment or just about seeing her soon ?"
"her head fell back against the head rest again and she took a deep , calming breath ."
"back up in her office , she sat down behind her desk and stared at all of her sticky notes ."
"how was she supposed to focus when she knew she had sixteen thousand dollars worth of clothes in her car ?"
"she did n't have time to drive to her apartment and be back in time ."
"she looked around , feeling as if the office were different somehow ."
"was it just because of her phone call with rais ?"
"had his voice completely altered her perception of her reality ?"
"she was n't sure , but she had things to do , vendors to schedule and confirm ."
"she did n't have time to dwell on her life right now ."
"`` i hear someone has had a very interesting morning , '' derrick commented as he strolled into her office ."
"he looked around and noticed the small space with the older chairs ."
"`` dear , since you have our biggest client , it seems as if you should also have a bigger office . ''"
"rachel swallowed uncomfortably ."
"she did n't feel as if she 'd earned this promotion since she 'd known rais all her life ."
"`` i think i should be honest with you ."
"rais is a personal friend of my father 's , '' she confessed ."
"`` that 's why i have these parties . ''"
"derrick waited another moment , then shrugged ."
"`` and ? ''"
"rachel leaned forward , confused by his calm demeanor ."
"`` and , i have n't earned a bigger office , derrick ."
"i 'm not as experienced and i feel as if i 've cheated . ''"
"he laughed and shook his head ."
"`` dear , this business is all about making connections ."
"do n't worry at all that you had a connection through your father ."
"how do you think i started this business ? ''"
"rachel had no idea actually so he continued on ."
"`` i did all of my mother 's parties ."
"when her friends saw how nice everything looked , they asked me to do their parties ."
"so in effect , you 're doing almost exactly what i did ."
"go with it , flaunt it , honey ! ''"
"rachel still felt awkward ."
"`` i suppose , '' she said non-committally ."
"`` anyway , everything seems to be going well for friday 's party ."
"this one is bigger but everything seems to be in place . ''"
"`` and you 're using my caterer this time ? ''"
"he asked , his eyes admonishing her because he knew that she had n't used his personal preference for last week 's event ."
"she took a deep breath before replying , `` actually , i 'm going with the same caterer ."
"she 's a personal friend of mine from college and even rais complimented her on the food ."
"she has a very creative mind and you wo n't believe what she has planned for this weekend . ''"
"she handed him the menu and waited anxiously as he read through the details , her shoulders dropping with relief when his eyebrows shot up in surprise ."
"`` that sounds heavenly !"
"what 's her name ?"
"and can i use her for other parties ? ''"
"he asked ."
"rachel laughed with relief at his approval ."
"`` absolutely !"
"i 've already given her the dates for my current set of events so i have her booked , but i 'm sure she 'd love your business as well . ''"
"derrick smiled and nodded his head ."
"`` now ... .about these dresses that arrived today . ''"
"rachel 's shoulders went right back to tensing again , wary of where this conversation might go now ."
"`` yes ... .the dresses . ''"
"`` spill it , dear . ''"
"`` rais sent them , '' she admitted , relieved to have it out in the open , but still concerned about what the dresses might imply ."
"`` and why did he send dresses that cost so much ? ''"
"she bit her lip and looked across her desk warily ."
"`` because he thought i would look pretty in them and he did n't want me to be embarrassed by the others who would be attending . ''"
"derrick absorbed that explanation with narrowed eyes , nodding his head ."
"after several moments of silence he asked , `` is there anything i should be concerned about ? ''"
"he asked carefully ."
"rachel thought about how to answer that ."
"`` possibly , '' she admitted ."
"`` but i ca n't be sure . ''"
"in her mind , she knew she was treading on dangerous ground but she was n't sure how to explain to her boss that she was sleeping with a client ."
"it was n't against the rules , but in her mind , it did n't seem like it was a very ethical place to be either ."
"`` reading between the lines , i 'm guessing you mean that you 're in an intimate relationship with the man , correct ? ''"
"`` yes , '' she said honestly `` and you understand the tenuous position you 're in ? ''"
"`` more than you know . ''"
"he sighed and nodded his head several times , going over the issue in his mind ."
"finally , he looked up at her ."
"`` here 's how this will work ."
"if you continue this relationship and it does n't impact the business or your performance , then i know nothing about this issue . ''"
"rachel was astonished ."
"she was sure she 'd be fired about now ."
"`` why would you make an exception like this for me ? ''"
"she asked as he stood up and started to walk out of her office ."
"he turned around and looked down at her ."
"`` because you 're not like the others , dear ."
"if anyone else on my staff were sleeping with a client , it would most likely be because they were mercenary and trying to seal the deal on future business ."
"that 's just tacky , '' he explained with disdain ."
"`` it also means they are n't very good at their job because they needed to add incentives that are n't on our specialties list , shall we say ? ''"
"he took a moment to laugh at his own joke ."
"`` but in your case , if you 're sleeping with the guy , you 're in love with him so it 's not tacky , it 's very sweet and romantic ."
"and i sincerely hope that things go well for you . ''"
"he was almost out the door when he stopped and turned back to her ."
"`` just let me know as far in advance as possible if you 're going to leave the firm for any reason , okay ?"
"you 're a very good coordinator and it will be hard to replace you . ''"
"rachel stared at the door , completely dumbfounded by his words ."
"she had no idea how long she sat there staring at the empty doorway but her mind had a very hard time trying to wrap itself around the idea of being in love with rais ."
"was it possible ?"
"she dismissed it as ludicrous and turned to face her computer screen , but her eyes could n't focus on what was in front of her ."
"she was still mulling over the idea that she was in love with rais ."
"they 'd known each other for so long ... .but love ?"
"that 's crazy !"
"no , she told herself ."
"she was merely infatuated with him just as she 'd been starting at sixteen ."
"she did n't love him , she told herself firmly ."
"love would mean caring and being emotionally invested ."
"this was just an affair ."
"he would get over her and ... ."
"she could n't go on from that thought because it hurt too much ."
"she pushed the idea of rais moving on to another woman out of her mind and focused on the tasks she had to deal with right now ."
"she had errands to do , vendors to check on ."
"she had to visit each of the vendors this week to ensure that they were ready and able to get everything prepared on time and she did n't just assume that they were making their deadlines ."
"she 'd learned from past experiences to check up on them at intervals the week before the party ."
"the flowers should already be at the florist by now , lana should have most of the meal prepared except for the items that needed to be steamed fresh ."
"as she made her way to each of the vendors for friday 's event , she thought about what derrick had said , her mind going over and over the possibility that she was in love with rais ."
"thankfully , some of the vendors had some problems that she needed to deal with so it was a distracting day ."
"in fact , there were several emergencies that cropped up that week , leaving her exhausted by the end of each day ."
"she checked her cell phone too , hoping that perhaps rais might call her ."
"she just wanted to talk to him , but she did n't make the call herself , knowing that he was a very busy man ."
"however tired she was at the end of each day just trying to get a party together , he was probably pretty wiped out after having to deal with the problems of an entire country ."
"by thursday afternoon , she knew that the party was going to be wonderful ."
"all the issues had been dealt with , the ice sculpture was perfect and freezing , the food was delicious as expected , the flowers were ready to be transported and the tent was already constructed with the tables set up ."
"she 'd refused to utilize the helicopter rais had left at her disposal ."
"she just could n't get past the expense of the machine but she thought it was very nice that he 'd offered it to her to save her time ."
"the drive out to the farm would n't be too bad because she 'd leave about three o'clock to inspect the site , then have dinner with her father and spend the night , driving back to her apartment in the early morning to avoid commuter traffic ."
"there was one thing bothering her though ."
"all week , she kept feeling as if someone was watching her ."
"she actually spotted a man leaning against a car one morning ."
"he appeared to be reading a newspaper , but when she glanced back at him , he was looking right at her ."
"wednesday , she saw another man sitting in a coffee shop outside of the floral shop she 'd contracted for the event and by thursday afternoon , she suspected that the same man from tuesday was following her out to the farm for the final inspection ."
"she 'd visited with her father that evening , but left out the back exit of the farm to get home , just trying to be cautious ."
"it was six o'clock when she got back on the road this morning and she was proud that she had n't been followed ."
"she had n't mentioned her suspicions to anyone ."
"she had n't wanted to worry her father and she was afraid rais would take her off of the event if he knew someone might be following her ."
"so she kept the issue to herself ."
"by thursday evening , she was feeling a little silly for being so paranoid , but could n't shake the feeling that she was being followed ."
"when she drove into the parking garage at her apartment , she actually took the stairs to her floor ."
"she 'd seen a dark car parked on the opposite side of her parking space with a man in a dark coat sitting inside reading a newspaper ."
"it looked odd because rachel did n't think there was enough light in the dim garage to read the newspaper ."
"she was out of breath when she slipped into her apartment and peered through the peep hole , wondering if she could see anyone who might be trying to spy on her ."
"was she being crazy ?"
"she glanced through the glass one more time , then sighed with relief when no one walked by ."
"she sagged with relief , dropping her purse on the counter ."
"she felt weird because normally she would have stopped by the lobby to get her mail but she 'd avoided that area today , preferring to just hibernate in her apartment , wanting that odd feeling to go away ."
"`` what 's out there that is so interesting ? ''"
"a deep voice asked ."
"rachel screamed and jumped about a foot in the hair , her hands reaching out to steady herself as she looked for the voice ."
"it was familiar , but rais was n't supposed to be back until tomorrow afternoon so it could n't be him here tonight !"
"`` rachel ? ''"
"rais asked , coming out of the darkness towards her , turning on lights as he walked ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"he demanded , his dark eyes looking down at her with both anger and concern ."
"rachel 's hand went up to her chest as if to slow her racing heart ."
"`` goodness !"
"you scared me ! ''"
"she grumbled , her body still in fight or flight mode and her head almost lightheaded ."
"adrenaline and no food were not a good combination she thought as she took a deep breath to try and calm herself ."
"`` what are you doing here ?"
"and how did you get into my apartment ? ''"
"she asked ."
"she was excited to see him , but still jumpy because of the people she 'd seen around the city ."
"he ignored her question and pulled her into his arms ."
"she did n't fight it because he was strong and secure and he held her tightly , decreasing the shivering until it was only a mild irritation ."
"`` what 's going on ?"
"why are you so scared ? ''"
"he demanded , his arms tightening around her ."
"his cell phone rang once and he answered it quickly , speaking into the phone in arabic , just a few words before he ended the call and slid the phone back into his pocket ."
"`` oh , i 'm just being silly , '' she said and leaned against him ."
"now that the scare was passing , she was overjoyed that he was here with her ."
"`` but what are you doing here ?"
"you were n't supposed to fly in until tomorrow . ''"
"he grinned down at her ."
"`` i canceled my meetings tomorrow , telling my advisors that i had priorities here ."
"they all understood , '' he explained , leaving out that he 'd told them that he was trying to convince this woman to marry him ."
"they were all eager for him to be married , telling him it should have happened years ago ."
"he bent down and kissed her neck , feeling her shivers increase and smiled to himself because this was for a different reason ."
"not that he was n't going to get down to the other reason , but she smelled too good right now , too distracting ."
"`` i want to hear all about your week , but first , i need you naked and in my arms , '' he said as he lifted her up , tossing her legs in the air and carried her into her bedroom ."
"he laid her down in the middle of her bed , then joined her , slipping her shoes off at the same time ."
"`` i missed you , '' he growled into her ear before biting it softly ."
"rachel smiled and lifted her arms , wrapping them around his shoulders , feeling as if she 'd just come home ."
"and if that little voice nagged at her that she was becoming too involved , too excited to see him , she ignored it and kissed him back , showing him how much she missed him and how happy she was to have him back with her ."
"chapter 6 `` i have to go to work , '' she whispered , the dawn just starting to break over the horizon ."
"`` no you do n't , '' he countered and pulled her closer , nudging her back down to the mattress ."
"`` you need to stay right here with me . ''"
"she laughed , feeling her sore limbs reach out for him ."
"`` you 're going to hate my bathroom , '' she told him when she slipped out from under his arm ."
"rais let his head drop down onto the pillow , wondering what he could do to get her back into bed with him and forget about the day and their respective responsibilities ."
"she looked sexy as hell as she pulled that silk robe over her naked body but he thought she looked even better on the bed next to him without it ."
"he sighed , knowing she was too responsible to lure back to bed ."
"he did n't like the result , but he respected her work ethic ."
"rolling onto his back and stuffing pillows behind him , he watched as she walked out of the bedroom ."
"he assumed she was stopping in the kitchen to make some coffee ."
"at least he hoped she was ."
"he could really use a cup and he had no idea how to get it other than her making it or him calling down to his guards to bring some up ."
"and he did n't think she 'd like it if he called his guards ."
"`` coffee is brewing , '' she said as she drifted back into the bedroom , only to disappear once again into the bathroom and closed the door ."
"he smiled lasciviously as he contemplated her disappearance ."
"he really should be a gentleman and leave her to shower in peace ."
"she 'd probably finish much more quickly if he just stayed put ."
"in the end , he realized that he really was n't much of a gentleman ."
"throwing off the comforter when he heard the shower start , he walked into the bathroom , completely unconcerned with his nakedness ."
"he surprised her as she was rinsing her hair and jumped when she felt his hands on her waist ."
"`` you woke up too early , '' he explained , letting his hands slide up her slick body ."
"`` i thought i could help you out with your shower . ''"
"she thought about telling him to get out because she knew with absolute certainty that he would not help her in any way ."
"but as soon as his hands slid along her skin , she was lost once again in his sensual spell ."
"she could n't believe how many times he 'd brought her to a screaming orgasm last night , almost embarrassed and wondering if her neighbors had heard them ."
"and now he wanted more ?"
"`` you 're insatiable , '' she gasped , but her arms were already winding around his neck , completely ready for another round with this man ."
"`` only for you , '' he said as he nipped her shoulder ."
"he picked up the soap and lathered his hands before smoothing them all over her arms and back , making sure she was completely lathered ."
"along the way , he touched her everywhere , driving her insane with his hands and his touch ."
"when she tried to pull back , unable to take anymore , he reached outside of the shower , picked up the foil packet and sheathed himself in the condom ."
"with a deft move , he lifted her into his arms and smiled when she automatically wrapped her legs around his waist ."
"he slowly lowered her onto him , watching her face as he impaled her on his shaft ."
"`` you feel incredible , '' he groaned , turning to lean her shoulders against the tiles so he could clasp her hips ."
"lifting her up , then slowly lowering her down , he began the rhythm that never failed to get her started ."
"as he increased the pace , he could feel her body tighten , clamp around him and he sped up , pushing her higher and higher ."
"when she splintered apart , her climax took him right along with her and he just about tumbled both of them to the shower floor ."
"`` do n't move , '' he ordered , his body still shuddering from her amazing body ."
"`` you 're amazing , '' he said as he tried to regain his breathing ."
"she laughed , pushing the hair out of her eyes as she looked up at him ."
"`` i do n't recall doing a great deal of work here in the past few minutes , '' she said , referring to the fact that he 'd done all the heavy lifting ."
"but she followed his command and stayed as still as possible ."
"`` can i put my legs down now ? ''"
"she suggested , teasing him for maintaining their position ."
"he raised an eyebrow ."
"`` are you saying you 'd like to be able to walk on your own ?"
"without my help ? ''"
"she laughed and rolled her eyes ."
"`` i 'm not sure i can walk , but perhaps you 'd like a bit of my weight taken off of your own legs ? ''"
"he nuzzled her neck , making her laugh ."
"`` individuality is overrated . ''"
"she giggled once again but pushed against his shoulders ."
"when he stepped back slightly , she lowered her legs to the shower floor , grateful for his arms that stayed around her to help her regain her balance which was n't so easy after that episode ."
"when she finally had her balance , she stepped back , self-conscious suddenly ."
"she grabbed the shampoo and used some in her hair , turning her back to him so he could n't see her face `` you ca n't hide from me , you know . ''"
"he said it softly , but there was a firmness in his voice that told her he was n't going to let this thing go ."
"`` what happened to the smiling woman of moments ago ? ''"
"he asked as he slid his hands into her hair to help her shampoo ."
"she sighed , bracing her hands against the sides of the shower stall ."
"`` she 's very happy in the throes of passion but when that subsides , a self-consciousness emerges that is hard to ignore . ''"
"he laughed and pulled her against him ."
"`` so what can i do to help you get over this self-consciousness ? ''"
"she turned and looked over her shoulder ."
"`` give me clothes ? ''"
"he raised an eyebrow ."
"`` wo n't they get wet ? ''"
"she laughed and threw her washcloth at him ."
"missing of course and then he had to grab her around the waist ."
"`` did you just toss this at me ? ''"
"he asked with an evil tone ."
"rachel could n't help it ."
"playful rais was just too new to her ."
"they used to laugh and tease each other , but because she 'd avoided him for so many years , she 'd forgotten this side of him ."
"`` i do n't think i did , '' she muffled , and then screamed out because he smacked her on the bottom , not hard but enough to sting and get her attention ."
"her eyes widened and she looked up at him ."
"`` did you just spank me ? ''"
"she asked , not sure if she should be horrified or turned on ."
"he smiled smugly down at her ."
"before he responded , he grabbed her wrists in each of his hands ."
"`` i think i did ."
"what are you going to do about it ? ''"
"he challenged , his eyes alight with mischief ."
"she licked her lips and shook her head ."
"`` why do n't you let my hands go and i 'll show you . ''"
"he laughed softly and shook his head ."
"`` i do n't think that would be a very good idea ."
"you threw your washcloth at me , madam ."
"that 's tantamount to treason in dunari . ''"
"she shrugged but she was trying hard to smother her own laughter ."
"`` so what ?"
"i 'm not afraid of you . ''"
"that answer caused his eyes to widen ."
"`` i think you should be afraid , '' he cautioned ."
"she tried to yank her hands free , but he had a very good grip on her hands ."
"she thought quickly ."
"`` so are you going to condition my hair ?"
"since you 've already washed it , i mean . ''"
"he looked surprised by her apparent change of subject ."
"`` condition ? ''"
"he asked , stupefied by her request ."
"he glanced down at the second bottle sitting next to the shampoo ."
"`` is that it ? ''"
"he asked and glanced back up at her ."
"`` yes , '' she replied , trying very hard to look innocent ."
"he put both of her hands in one of his before he reached down for the conditioner ."
"he knew something was up , but he could n't figure it out ."
"he took the bottle and squeezed some into her hair ."
"when he realized what he needed to do , that he would need both hands , he spun her around easily , pressed her back against the tiles and pinned her in place ."
"`` you 're up to something , '' he said with his husky voice ."
"`` but for the life of me , i ca n't figure it out . ''"
"she continued to keep her face straight and all the amusement out of her eyes while he massaged her scalp with his hands once again ."
"he was completely missing the point of the conditioner , but to win this battle , she was more than willing to sacrifice today ."
"`` mmmmm ... that feels really good , '' she said , closing her eyes so he would n't see her intent ."
"`` and you know what 's best ? ''"
"she asked , rolling her head to the side ."
"`` what ? ''"
"he asked and she could hear the suspicion in his voice ."
"she opened her eyes and looked up at him with wide eyes , her smile growing slowly ."
"she waited until he knew she was up to something before she said , `` you 're hands are n't going to be able to hold me now , '' she said and slipped out of his grasp and spraying the water right at him ."
"unfortunately , she had severely underestimated her opponent ."
"his hands might not be able to stop her , but his arms were incredibly strong and he had years of military training on his side ."
"she only got away with the initial sting of success before he hand her flipped around and repined once again , using more of his legs than anything else ."
"to make it worse , she was laughing so hard she could n't put up a fight , or even hold him away from her as he held her in place and tickled her mercilessly , his fingers made more nimble by the conditioner that helped them slide over her skin ."
"`` i give up ! ''"
"she cried out , gasping for air ."
"`` i promise to behave ! ''"
"she begged ."
"he stopped and looked down at her , one eyebrow raised in challenge ."
"`` who says i want you to behave ? ''"
"her surprise was only for a moment before she started laughing once again , charmed by this side of him that she 'd missed so much ."
"`` so what do you want ? ''"
"she asked , not sure she actually wanted him to answer ."
"`` hmmm ... .that 's a loaded question ."
"i want you , naked , all weekend , in my bed without any interruptions . ''"
"her smile grew broader as he finished his description and her whole body tingled with excitement ."
"`` is that what will happen next weekend ? ''"
"he kissed her gently ."
"`` hopefully it will happen this weekend as soon as tonight 's event is finished . ''"
"`` i thought you had that embassy thing tomorrow ."
"is n't that why you bought me the second dress ? ''"
"he sighed and leaned his head back ."
"`` i hate those parties ."
"they are the most tedious few hours in existence . ''"
"he brought his head down and looked at her with an intensity that had her gasping for breath ."
"`` but you 'll be there tomorrow and i do n't have to let you out of bed after that , right ? ''"
"she could n't help but agree , nodding her head enthusiastically ."
"`` well , except for riding , '' she clarified ."
"`` okay , one ride . ''"
"`` and maybe dinner with my dad ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he sighed ."
"`` lunch ! ''"
"he contradicted ."
"`` deal . ''"
"`` and you 're naked the entire rest of the weekend , '' he commanded ."
"she sighed and tilted her head to the side as if considering his request ."
"before she could say anything , he grabbed her by the waist and lifted her up , twisting so he could rinse out her hair ."
"`` you act like this is up for debate , my beauty ."
"it is n't . ''"
"he lifted his arms and moved her hair around so the conditioner would rinse out ."
"`` so i 'm to be restrained if i do n't obey ? ''"
"she asked , lifting her eyebrows as he shut off the water ."
"he stilled , a wolfish grin spreading across his face ."
"`` i think you are a brilliant woman . ''"
"he lifted her once again , carrying her out of the shower stall and setting her down on the soft carpet ."
"he grabbed a towel and gently dried her off ."
"`` i think i might have stumbled into something out of my league , '' she replied , putting her hand on his head to balance herself ."
"`` ah , but you wo n't know until i have you completely at my mercy . ''"
"he stood up and looked down at her with that special intensity that never failed to melt her bones ."
"she reached up her hand , touching him gently on the cheek with her fingertips ."
"`` does that mean you 'll be at my mercy ? ''"
"she asked softly , bending her knee slightly so she could lean against him , the towel hanging uselessly by his side ."
"she should feel cold with the cooler air from her apartment hitting her wet skin ."
"but with rais looking at her with that kind of promise in his eyes , she felt nothing but heat , feeling almost uncomfortably warm ."
"`` absolutely , '' he almost whispered , pulling her close and kissing her gently ."
"when he released her , she almost skipped into her bedroom to dress , feeling as if her world was perfect now that he had come back here early ."
"the whole 'love ' and 'end of relationship ' issues were not going to intrude for the next seventy-two hours , she told herself firmly ."
"she glanced at the clock as she pulled on her slacks and a silk blouse ."
"`` what are you doing today ? ''"
"she asked , her mind already going through her own schedule ."
"she had last minute inspections at his house and was going out to supervise all of the last minute setups ."
"everything needed to be finished and in place by five o'clock , she 'd told everyone so she could go to her father 's place and get herself ready ."
"`` i have meetings downtown , '' he commented , walking to her closet and pulling out a suit ."
"he winked at her as she blinked at his use of her space ."
"she was so surprised , and that silly , bubbly feeling in her stomach started up again as she thought of how domestic the two of them seemed to be right now ."
"waking up , showering , getting dressed ... it was nice , she thought ."
"`` coffee ? ''"
"she asked and added a bit of mascara to her lashes , then tossed all her makeup into a bag to take with her for the night ."
"`` please ."
"are you ready to go ? ''"
"he asked , coming out of her bedroom after her , straightening his tie which he 'd just knotted into a perfect knot ."
"she looked around , glancing at the boxes that she 'd set on the sofa earlier ."
"`` i think so , '' she replied warily ."
"`` what are you wearing ? ''"
"he asked , noting the boxes and her nervous glance back to him ."
"she bit her lip , trying to make up her mind ."
"`` i 'll wear the black lace tonight , '' she said softly and was rewarded by his triumphant grin ."
"`` does this mean i can send you other presents and you 'll accept them more easily ? ''"
"`` no ! ''"
"she replied firmly , shaking her head ."
"give him and inch and he would take a mile , she thought with exasperation ."
"`` why not ?"
"if it gives me pleasure , would you deny me that ? ''"
"she laughed as she poured him a cup of coffee into a travel mug ."
"`` i think you get too much pleasure as it is , '' she replied , refusing to give in on this issue ."
"he accepted the coffee but blocked her way ."
"`` you know , you 're going to have to give in on some of the things i give you . ''"
"she laughed and leaned back against her counter , holding her own coffee out to the side ."
"`` and why would i do that ?"
"i think i prefer keeping you on your toes . ''"
"he leaned forward , forcing her to lean back slightly ."
"`` i will win this one , rachel ."
"you will eventually be dressed only in the clothes i have bought for you and draped in jewels that i have given you ."
"and you will love every moment of it . ''"
"`` will i ? ''"
"she asked sarcastically ."
"`` i do n't think so ."
"i prefer being independent . ''"
"he looked down at her carefully , trying to calculate a way to get her to give in to his preferences ."
"`` and what if you were in a position in my government that would require you to be dressed in a certain way ? ''"
"she considered that carefully ."
"`` first of all , i would n't accept a position in your government , '' she replied ."
"`` that would n't be very ethical ."
"i 'm already having a problem because we 're lovers and you 're also a client ."
"my boss is concerned as well , '' she said as a side issue ."
"`` but regardless of that , i would n't feel comfortable accepting gifts from a man . ''"
"he grinned as if he had a secret ."
"`` you 're going to get over that pretty quickly . ''"
"he took her hand and lifted it to his mouth to kiss her knuckles ."
"`` your helicopter awaits , '' he said and pulled her out the door ."
"`` i heard that you were n't utilizing that this past week ."
"would you explain why ? ''"
"she grabbed her purse , her notes and the bag she 'd been packing all week in preparation for this weekend ."
"`` i need those boxes , '' she said , pulling against his hand ."
"he opened the door and took her bag off of her shoulder , handing it to a man who was already standing outside of her apartment door ."
"rachel glanced back , grabbing the bag because she thought it was falling off of her shoulder ."
"when she saw the strange man with the dark , bulky suit , she stumbled slightly , only catching herself when she quickly put her foot behind her ."
"the man looked vaguely familiar but she was late and had to grab the boxes ."
"`` gerard will get that , rachel , '' rais admonished patiently ."
"she glanced up at him , at the guard then back to rais ."
"`` i do n't ... '' `` come along , '' he said and took her hand once again ."
"the guard waited until they were out the door before entering the apartment to pick up the boxes ."
"a moment later , he had the boxes in his arms and was following both of them down the hallway ."
"the only uncomfortable moment was when she passed by her neighbor 's door just as the older woman was also leaving her own apartment ."
"the woman glared at rachel , then up to rais before sniffing and shaking her head ."
"rachel was mortified , completely understanding that the woman was irritated because of all the noise she and rais had made overnight ."
"the apartments were n't the best in the city and the walls were n't very thick ."
"she 'd suspected that their nocturnal activities had been overheard but having evidence of it so blatantly in front of her was unnerving and embarrassing ."
"`` what was all that about ? ''"
"rais asked when they were in the elevators alone ."
"`` that 's margaret ."
"she has two kids and shares a wall with me . ''"
"he immediately understood and almost laughed ."
"`` and i suppose she did n't get very much sleep last night either , eh ? ''"
"rachel wanted to punch his arm , but she refrained since his body guard was in front of the two of them ."
"`` i think her look explained that her rem sleep was deeply disturbed . ''"
"he led her outside into the sunshine and rachel blinked before she got her sunglasses in place ."
"when she did , she looked around , then stopped in her tracks ."
"the two men she 'd seen throughout the week were standing beside a long , black limousine ."
"she stopped and looked at the two of them , pulling on rais ' hand ."
"`` do n't get in the car , rais , '' she whispered and pulled him closer , stepping in front of him as if to guard her ."
"the two men looked at each other , then back to her ."
"rais was pulling her to his side , trying to understand ."
"`` what 's wrong , rachel ? ''"
"he asked softly ."
"since he was trying to pull her to his side , she plastered herself against him , terrified that these men were out to hurt him ."
"`` those men , '' she whispered , `` i 've seen them before . ''"
"he looked at the two men who heard her despite her whisper ."
"`` of course you 've seen them , '' he said gently ."
"`` they have been watching out for your safety while i 've been gone . ''"
"she blinked and looked up at him ."
"`` my safety ? ''"
"she squeaked ."
"`` yes ."
"they 're your personal body guards . ''"
"she looked back at them , surveying the bulges under their dark suits ."
"`` are they armed ? ''"
"she asked , terrified of what those bulges might mean ."
"`` of course they are , '' he laughed softly , his arm wrapping around her ."
"`` get in the car and let 's talk . ''"
"she sensed that he was both amused and irritated , but for the life of her , she could n't figure out why ."
"she was furious with him ."
"how could he have put some thugs on her , trailing her all over the city and countryside , without telling her !"
"she slipped into the back , still watching the two men warily ."
"she held her tongue until the door was closed but as soon as they were alone again , she let him have it ."
"`` what do you mean they have been assigned to me ?"
"i did n't consent to being guarded ."
"and do you have any idea how terrifying it is to be followed and not know why ?"
"those men were n't very subtle in their guardianship , or whatever it is that you call it . ''"
"an eyebrow went up with her diatribe and he leaned back ."
"`` i had no idea that you were aware of their protection ."
"they were supposed to be around , but as inconspicuous as possible . ''"
"she stared at him as if he 'd lost his mind ."
"`` you arranged for someone to follow me and did n't bother to mention anything to me ?"
"why would you do that ? ''"
"rais sighed and rubbed his hand over his face ."
"he knew that rachel was really upset about this and he was n't sure how to appease her without telling her of his plans for her ."
"`` i need to make sure you are safe , rachel ."
"and i 'm sorry for not telling you ."
"i thought if you knew about the guards , you would be angry with me . ''"
"his apology went a long way to easing her anger , but it was still difficult to get over the fact that he had done something behind her back ."
"she looked out the window , watching as the city traffic whizzed by outside ."
"`` why do i need protection ?"
"why are n't they out there guarding you ? ''"
"rais considered the possible answers he could give her ."
"in the end , he was as honest as he could be ."
"`` my enemies are dangerous , rachel ."
"they would use you to get to me . ''"
"she rolled her eyes ."
"`` i 'm no one , rais ."
"when it comes to international politics , i really do n't count ."
"call off the men , please . ''"
"he sighed and shook his head , knowing this was going to cause problems ."
"but she was to be protected at all costs ."
"`` i ca n't do that . ''"
"he put a finger over her lips to stop her next argument as well ."
"`` by the way , when you perceive a threat , you damn well better not try and get in front of me ."
"that 's what my guards are for ."
"you get behind me or them ."
"understand ? ''"
"`` what are you talking about ? ''"
"she asked , her eyes curious as she tried to grasp his meaning ."
"`` back at your apartment building , '' he clarified ."
"`` you were nervous about the strange men and you stepped in front of me ."
"do n't ever do that again . ''"
"she gritted her teeth , not sure why he was being so obstinate about that ."
"he noticed her stubborn expression and shook his head ."
"`` i will not allow someone to hurt you because you 're trying to protect me . ''"
"she crossed her arms over her chest , her chin jutting out rebelliously ."
"`` so ... '' `` no arguments , rachel , '' he said sternly ."
"`` let my men do their jobs . ''"
"she was n't sure what to say about that , but since they 'd arrived at the building with the heliport , she did n't have a chance to argue with him ."
"but what was she supposed to say ?"
"that she would n't let anything happen to him ?"
"that she loved him too much to lose him ?"
"he did n't want to hear things like that ."
"he was the kind of man who wanted to be free , to pursue the next woman ."
"she hated that , but she could n't think of losing him to someone trying to hurt him either ."
"chapter 7 rachel walked into the stables , her booted heels almost silent on the dirt and straw that softened the paths for the horses ."
"the previous weekend had been idyllic and she was excited about seeing him this weekend ."
"they 'd spent all weekend in each other 's company , laughing and talking , spending time with her father and just being close ."
"she knew she was in trouble , knew that she was in love with rais ."
"a silly love song was going through her mind and she wanted to surprise rais tonight ."
"she wanted to see him , to feel his hands on her tonight ."
"she 'd missed him last night , felt lonely as she woke up alone in her cold bed without him ."
"their plans for her going to dunari this weekend were changed because he had a meeting with the president but that meant he was still coming here this weekend and she would get to see him throughout the whole three days without any other social obligations ."
"she could n't believe how much better she felt now that her fear of intimacy was gone , not to mention feeling so much love for rais ."
"she could n't believe she could feel so much for one person ."
"she loved her dad , but this was a completely different feeling ."
"she wanted to be with rais all the time , to make him laugh and get him to relax more , to listen to his problems and see what she could do to help him ."
"she wanted to curl up on his lap and talk about her own problems , touch his skin and explore his body ."
"she 'd never felt that way about any other man before ."
"but then , she 'd probably always been in love with rais ."
"it had started off as friendship when she 'd been a child , but as she 'd grown older , it had blossomed into something more , something deeper ."
"she just had n't admitted it until now ."
"it was dark outside by this time of the night but the lights inside the stables were warm and inviting ."
"she stopped by to say hello to dolce and give her an apple , then moved on down to greet her father before she headed up to the main house to find rais ."
"she did n't want her father to find out that she was serious about rais from someone else ."
"the light was on in his office and she smiled , wanting to surprise him as well ."
"he 'd been delighted to see her out here more often and she suspected that he was aware of her feelings for rais , but had kept silent ."
"`` why do n't we just head into one of the stalls , '' rachel heard someone say from inside her father 's office ."
"rachel stopped , her feet frozen in place as she tried to recognize the feminine voice ."
"was her father involved with another woman ?"
"it was about time , she thought with excitement , and a little bit of trepidation ."
"they 'd been alone for so long , she was n't sure how she felt about her dad dating , but she wanted him to be happy ."
"`` i 'm busy , lila ."
"why do n't you come back another time ? ''"
"that was n't her father 's voice !"
"she stepped back , wondering why rais was talking with another woman ."
"and what was her name ?"
"she recognized it , but could n't put a face to the voice ."
"where had she heard that voice before ?"
"`` oh , come on , darling ."
"we always have so much fun together . ''"
"rais looked down at the woman with long dark hair and too much makeup ."
"what had he seen in this woman before ?"
"she was n't anything like rachel , but then again , neither had any of the other women he 'd dated over the last decade ."
"he 'd tried to find a substitute , but none had matched the real thing ."
"rachel was light and beauty , laughter and desire so strong he could n't believe he 'd settled for pale substitutes instead of the real thing ."
"she was so much more in all ways than these women ."
"`` lila , i have work to do , '' he said , trying to be kind , but wanting to get rid of her ."
"he was thinking that he could get his pilot out here and be in rachel 's bed in less than forty-five minutes if he moved quickly ."
"he 'd have to check with her to make sure she was free since he 'd arrived a day earlier than he 'd anticipated ."
"she might need to work tonight and he did n't want to do anything to interfere ."
"of course , when they married , she would n't have these issues unless she wanted them ."
"he smiled just thinking about rachel in his home , in his bed back in dunari ."
"his body actually hardened at the idea of rachel growing large with their children ."
"damn he wanted her !"
"for life and not just for a short affair ."
"he had no idea what rachel had in mind , but he 'd talk with her about it as soon as he saw her again ."
"he wanted things settled between them and no more of this temporary , weekend stuff they 'd been having together ."
"he wanted her all the time , by his side and at his table as well as in his bed at night ."
"`` i love the way you respond so willingly , '' lila purred , feeling his response and happily assuming it was because of her suggestion ."
"rais looked up , not sure what the woman was talking about ."
"then he noticed the way she was looking down and he quickly shook his head as she approached him ."
"`` this is n't what you ... '' he stopped when she pressed her body against him , plastering her glossy lips over his ."
"rachel felt like someone had just stabbed her in the stomach ."
"seeing rais with another woman in his arms , with her lips on his and her body pressing against his hard one just the way she wanted to do , the way she 'd been anticipating doing with him only moments ago , felt like the most brutal betrayal she could imagine ."
"it was also at that moment that rais looked up from the woman in his arms to spy her in the doorway ."
"the first moment she 'd spotted the two in each other 's arms , she wanted to just hide , pretend like she had n't seen anything ."
"but that was n't an option now ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' she whispered , fighting the tears that sprang to her eyes almost instantly ."
"`` i should have knocked . ''"
"she stepped back out of her dad 's office and closed the door ."
"she looked to the right and the left , not really sure what she could do to escape ."
"she knew she just needed to get out of there as fast as possible ."
"she turned to the left , heading for her car ."
"she could n't even stop by her father 's cottage to say hello to him , just needing to get away from rais and his house and everything about him right now ."
"`` rachel wait ! ''"
"she heard rais call out to her ."
"his voice spurred her on and she sprinted down the center of the stables towards her car ."
"she could n't see him , did n't want to hear his explanations ."
"if he was even going to offer one ."
"she 'd known going into this relationship that rais was n't a man who stayed with one woman ."
"she 'd seen him with so many women over the years and she 'd ignored the warning signs ."
"rais loved women ."
"he was a consummate lover and competitor who played to win ."
"she rushed out , digging her keys out of her pocket and pressing the remote to unlock her car door ."
"she heard solid footsteps behind her and made her feet move faster ."
"the tears were blinding her though and she stumbled on something ."
"thankfully she was able to recover and reach her car ."
"she dove inside just as rais reached her but she locked the doors before he could open it ."
"she started the engine and drove off , unconcerned that he saw her tears , knew how hurt she was ."
"she was beyond trying to hide from him now ."
"he 'd broken down every single defense she had , and even some she had n't been aware she 'd built up and now she had nothing ."
"she sped away , uncaring about anything but putting space between herself and rais ."
"the woman in her dad 's office even looked like her !"
"her long , dark hair was styled similarly , but not exactly like hers and she was the same height and about the same weight ."
"the other woman had larger breasts though ."
"was that what he wanted in a woman ?"
"she hated him so much , but she was disgusted with herself just as much for trusting him , for believing in the fairy tale , especially with a man like rais ."
"she 'd known better !"
"she 'd told herself over and over that he was n't the man for her ."
"that he was n't the man for any woman who wanted a monogamous relationship ."
"he did n't have it in him , she thought ."
"why had she even started dreaming about a future with him ?"
"that just made everything hurt even more ."
"she 'd believed him when he said those sweet , delicious words ."
"she 'd stupidly translated those into words of love and commitment ."
"well , now she knew better ."
"it was a hard lesson to learn but at least she 'd figured it out ."
"she drove down the highway , surprised at how many people were traveling on interstate 66 at this time of the night ."
"she glanced at the clock on her dashboard and was surprised to find that it was only seven-thirty in the evening ."
"somehow , with everything that had happened , she thought it was later ."
"so much had happened in the last thirty minutes ."
"she 'd only arrived at rais ' farm at seven o'clock after getting off of work at five o'clock ."
"on the drive out , traffic had been heavy but she had n't cared , too excited at the prospect of seeing rais , maybe having dinner with him and ... yes , she had wanted to spend the night with him ."
"she had n't even cared that her father would have known about it ."
"she was n't sure she could stand the questions if he found out about this huge mess ."
"the tears were so heavy with that thought , she could barely see so she pulled off of the highway , not wanting to hurt anyone because she could n't drive properly ."
"she pulled into a coffee shop and parked , taking deep breaths to try and calm herself down ."
"she just needed a cup of tea , she told herself ."
"she looked in her rearview mirror , dabbed some powder onto her red cheeks , added a touch of lipstick , then felt at least presentable ."
"inside , she ordered her tea and ignored the odd looks from the woman behind the counter ."
"she took her cardboard cup and found an empty chair in the corner , wanting to just curl up and hide ."
"but she 'd been doing that for years ."
"ever since she was eighteen years old and knew that her feelings for rais were deeper than just friendship , she 'd hidden from him ."
"deep down , she guessed she knew this kind of thing might happen ."
"sure enough , as soon as rais discovered her , he came after her with all of that charm and confidence , that maleness that just lured women towards him ."
"the tea was too hot to drink but it felt warm in her hands and helped the numbness that was slowly taking over ."
"she supposed that was the body 's way of avoiding the crippling pain ."
"if she could n't feel anything , she would n't hurt so badly ."
"the tears were falling , but since she was n't driving , she was n't trying to focus so she was n't aware of the tears ."
"they fell on her hand and her cup , onto her sweater and melted into the fabric to disappear ."
"every time she thought of rais , her mind jumped back to him in that other woman 's arms ."
"when he 'd pulled back from her kiss , there had been her red lipstick on his mouth and he 'd looked horrible ."
"she wanted to hate him , but it hurt too much to think about him right now ."
"just sip the tea , she told herself ."
"do n't think about rais , or the other woman ."
"do n't think about the future or the past , or anything ."
"just take each moment separately ."
"with a sob , she realized that she could n't even lose herself in work right now because her only client was rais ."
"he 'd hijacked her career and , until now , she had n't cared because it had been nice to just be around him ."
"she 'd been happy organizing his parties and acting as his hostess ."
"she 'd been proud of the work he was accomplishing during those events and had been excited that they 'd gone off so well ."
"she could n't go back to work , she thought sadly ."
"she did n't have anything to do now ."
"for the past several weeks , her whole life had revolved around rais ."
"she 'd have to quit her job , find another one within the industry because derrick would be furious that she would n't work with rais any longer ."
"he 'd even be angry that she 'd become personally involved with a client , which was a big no-no in the industry and for derrick 's employees especially ."
"he 'd told her what would happen so nothing was a surprise ."
"she 'd broken so many rules , she could n't even count them , she realized ."
"she 'd just been happily going about her life , pretending that things would all work out in the end ."
"and they had n't ."
"she picked up her tea and carried it back to her car ."
"she started to unlock the door so she could drive to her apartment , but she hesitated ."
"did she really want to go back to her apartment ?"
"sleep in the bed where she and rais had made love ?"
"could she do it ?"
"no , she thought with a pain that shot through her body ."

CHUNK 3:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"she did n't want to see her apartment just yet ."
"she could n't do it ."
"she pulled open the door and considered her options ."
"it was a friday night , where could she go ?"
"she drove down the street a ways and found a hotel ."
"she parked in the lot , picked up her lukewarm tea and walked into the lobby ."
"she was n't even sure about the name , just walked up to the desk clerk and asked for a room ."
"the man behind the counter must have seen something on her face because he did n't ask any questions , just quickly clicked on his computer and brought up a room ."
"within moments , her credit card had been charged and a plastic key card handed to her ."
"`` do you need help with your luggage ? ''"
"he asked gently ."
"rachel only shook her head and bit her lip so she would n't start crying again ."
"`` thank you , '' she whispered ."
"she took the key and followed the man 's instructions , going to the elevator and the fifteenth floor ."
"inside the room , she did n't even turn on the lights ."
"she simply curled up in the overstuffed chair by the window and let the tears flow down her cheeks once again ."
"this time , she did n't even try to stop them , allowing them to just flow as they came ."
"rachel stared out at the night , watching the traffic flow on the major streets ."
"she was n't aware of the traffic slowing down , and then by the early hours of the morning , the traffic was almost non-existent ."
"she was n't aware of the planes taking off and landing at reagan national airport , and then by midnight they slowed to a halt as well ."
"she did n't see any of it , her mind not even thinking ."
"she cried , she went numb and cried some more ."
"when the sun rose over the horizon , she blinked and cried some more ."
"she ordered room service , asking for coffee to be delivered to her room ."
"when she could n't sit on the chair anymore , she showered , but putting her clothes back on again was n't the most pleasant feeling ."
"she did n't have an alternative though ."
"with a sigh , she picked up her purse and walked out into the hallway ."
"she still did n't want to go home , wanting to avoid life for a little while longer ."
"she was being a coward , but facing her apartment would hurt too much ."
"this was n't what she signed up for , she thought as she unlocked her car and slipped into the driver 's seat ."
"she pulled her phone out and realized that it had run out of power ."
"no wonder she had n't heard it last night , she thought as she plugged it in and started her engine ."
"as she turned it on again , she glanced at the message indicator ."
"she almost started crying again when she saw that there were fifteen messages from rais ."
"she could n't listen to them now so she skipped through those ."
"when she reached the end , she found several from her father as well ."
"she dialed his number and waited , relieved when his voice mail picked up ."
"she did n't want to talk to him right now , tired of crying and knowing that he would cause her to start up again with his gentle questions ."
"`` hi dad , it 's me ."
"i just wanted you to know that i 'm okay ."
"i 'm just ... .well , i 'm okay , '' she said and pressed the end button before her voice cracked and he knew that she really was n't okay ."
"she 'd just pulled out of the parking lot when her phone rang again ."
"she looked down at the screen and saw that it was rais calling from his office , so she pressed the 'ignore ' button and turned left ."
"she had n't eaten since lunch yesterday , but she still was n't hungry ."
"she pulled up to a fast food restaurant and ordered another cup of coffee , then drove out again ."
"she supposed she needed to head back to her apartment at least for a change of clothes ."
"driving into her parking lot , she scanned the other cars , wondering if her dad or rais might have come by to talk to her ."
"but no one was around except for the familiar cars that were normally here ."
"she was n't sure why rais would try and talk to her anyway ."
"he was probably relieved that she now knew the truth about their relationship ."
"he did n't have to do the dirty work and tell her that he needed to move on ."
"riding up in the elevator , she wondered what she would have done if he 'd been honest with her up front ."
"if he 'd told her that this would be just like his other relationships , would she have eventually fallen for his charms ?"
"she wanted to think she would n't have , but she might have come to him anyway ."
"no , she would n't ."
"she 'd known for too long how she felt about rais ."
"he was the man she 'd run away from at eighteen ."
"he 'd been the man she 'd followed via the internet all through college , who had kept her away from her father during the summer months when she could have been working at the farm and hanging out with the horses , which is what she would have preferred doing ."
"so no ."
"if she 'd known that she was one more brunette in a long line of similar looking women , she would have avoided his farm like the plague ."
"rais snapped the phone off once again , furious that she would n't answer his call ."
"her father had just phoned him to let him know that she was okay and now he knew what she was feeling since she would n't take his call ."
"there was no way he was going to let her get away with that ."
"he 'd fought too hard for her , waited too long ."
"and what they had with each other was special ."
"his fingers closed over the ring he 'd bought two weeks ago ."
"he should have put that ring on her finger the first night he 'd gotten her into bed ."
"he should have let her know exactly how he felt ."
"if he had it to do all over again , he would have proposed the first time he saw her that night in her father 's cottage ."
"dammit !"
"she should know how he felt !"
"he might not have been explicit , but she should have read between the lines and known he was in love with her !"
"he could n't lose her , he thought , panic starting to build up in his chest ."
"he would get her back somehow ."
"his phone rang and he glanced down at the message ."
"his head of security had locked in on the gps within her cell phone ."
"she was heading back to her apartment , finally !"
"he raced out of the house , calling to his pilot to get the bird going ."
"within minutes , he was airborne and flying across the city ."
"he could land on a building about four blocks from her house ."
"`` make sure there 's a car outside the building waiting for me , '' he commanded to one of his guards who had been ordered to stay outside of her apartment in case she returned ."
"`` do n't lose her ! ''"
"twenty minutes later , he was landing on top of the building ."
"he exited the helicopter , uncaring about his security guards who scampered to catch up with him ."
"they were in the elevator with him but all he wanted was to get to rachel and make her understand ."
"his fingers once again closed around the engagement ring ."
"he would have this ring on her finger within the hour !"
"and she would n't ever have a reason to take it off ."
"the building manager had been warned that he was arriving and was waiting outside , ready to escort him into the building ."
"rais barely acknowledged the man 's assistance , so determined to get to rachel quickly ."
"at her door , he pounded against the steel door ."
"`` i know you 're in there , rachel ."
"let me in so we can talk . ''"
"rachel heard his voice and her heart sank ."
"she stared at her door , her stomach clenching and a sick feeling overwhelming her ."
"she did n't answer , just stared at the door , wondering what to do ."
"`` rachel , i 'm not leaving here until we talk ."
"if you want to do it through the door , that 's fine with me but do you really want your neighbors to know all about our business ? ''"
"he asked loudly ."
"her hands fisted by her sides and she almost growled out her frustration ."
"she stomped to the door and opened it , glaring at him as he stepped inside her apartment ."
"`` thank you , '' he said ironically and walked past her ."
"`` where were you last night ? ''"
"he demanded as soon as her door was closed and they were alone together ."
"`` none of your business . ''"
"`` it is my business , '' he countered and moved closer to her ."
"she took a step back and he stopped , but he did n't retreat ."
"`` what we have together is n't going away . ''"
"`` it 's already gone , '' she argued ."
"`` i told you before ."
"i do n't do casual sex . ''"
"he leaned in to her with a smile that was n't at all humorous ."
"`` and i told you that was n't what i wanted from you . ''"
"`` but the other women ?"
"you 'll do casual with them ?"
"i 'm the only one that thinks she might be ... '' she stopped before she made a fool of herself ."
"`` never mind . ''"
"`` i wo n't ."
"what were you going to say ? ''"
"he asked and stepped forward ."
"when she retreated this time , he came forward again ."
"`` i want to know what you thought we were doing . ''"
"she could n't stop the tears , wanting him gone and out of her life so she could start to heal once again ."
"`` just leave me alone ."
"we do n't have the same priorities in life ."
"i ca n't meet your needs and you ca n't meet mine . ''"
"`` you are everything i want in a woman ! ''"
"he countered fiercely ."
"`` sure i am ."
"i 'm so wonderful and so fulfilling that you needed another chickybabe on the side , right ? ''"
"`` she was coming after me , rachel ."
"i was not reciprocating . ''"
"`` is that why her lipstick was all over your mouth when i walked in ? ''"
"she wiped angrily at the tears that she could n't stop ."
"at the sight of her tears , and the red rimmed eyes , rais felt like someone had just punched him in the gut hard ."
"he hated seeing her like this , wanted to pull her into his arms and soothe the pain he knew she was feeling ."
"because he knew how he would feel if he ever saw her with another man like she 'd found him last night ."
"`` rachel , i know how it looks but you 're wrong ."
"i was n't coming onto her ."
"it was all on her side and if you had come in a few moments later , you would have seen me pushing her away ."
"if you 'd waited just a moment before entering , i would have told her that you are the woman i wanted . ''"
"`` for now . ''"
"`` not for now ! ''"
"he replied , softly , but with force ."
"`` i want you forever ."
"i want to wake up next to you every morning for the rest of my life ."
"i want to fall asleep with you curled up in my arms ."
"i want you at my table and bearing our children together ."
"i want you , rachel ."
"i 've loved you for so long i ca n't even remember when my feelings for you changed from friendship and brotherly affection , to something significantly deeper . ''"
"she wanted so desperately to believe him but how could she ?"
"`` then why all the women over the years ? ''"
"`` because i was trying to replace you , rachel , '' he came back ."
"his voice was n't yelling anymore ."
"it was soft , confident and forceful ."
"`` they all looked like you because you were either too young for what i felt for you , or you were avoiding me ."
"i did n't want to scare you when you were so young , but then you disappeared and would n't even come out to visit your father during the summers . ''"
"`` because i knew you 'd be there . ''"
"`` and you hated me for the women ."
"but they were rachel replacements . ''"
"she looked up at him , not sure if she liked the words he was telling her ."
"`` why would you do that ? ''"
"`` because i loved you ."
"i wanted you so badly and you were so timid , so scared and i 'd known you for so long , even i did n't know what i was feeling for you until a few years ago . ''"
"`` i do n't believe you , '' she said , but the words were filled with the pain of yesterday 's visions and not the heat of moments before ."
"`` i know you do n't , honey ."
"and there 's nothing i can do to convince you otherwise ."
"you 're just going to have to trust me . ''"
"she thought about that for a long moment , closing her eyes and squeezing them shut ."
"`` i do n't know if i can trust you , rais ."
"i 've seen you with women just like me too many times ."
"and it hurts . ''"
"he sighed , but would n't relent ."
"`` i know that ."
"but put yourself in my place ."
"i wanted you so badly for so long . ''"
"`` i am in your place ."
"and i did n't go out and find other men who looked like you ."
"i did n't sleep with a slew of men just to replace the one man i always wanted . ''"
"the surprise in his eyes and the smile that slowly grew on his face confused her ."
"`` that amuses you ? ''"
"she asked , walking around him so that she was on the opposite side of the room ."
"since the room was n't very big , there was maybe only one additional foot between them but anything was better than being trapped in the corner ."
"`` get out ! ''"
"she snapped at him ."
"the grin on his face increased and he shook his head ."
"`` i 'm not going anywhere , '' he said softly ."
"rachel instantly noticed that his voice had become husky , deeper somehow and she looked up at him worriedly ."
"`` i hate you , '' she whispered ."
"if he was n't going to leave , then she would ."
"she could n't stay here with him looking so arrogant ."
"she just wanted out ."
"she walked back by him , trying to stay out of his reach but her apartment was n't big enough ."
"she was just about to reach for her purse and keys when he stopped her with the expedient method of grabbing her instead ."
"`` let me go , '' she sobbed , her fists pounding against his massive chest but it did n't do anything to stop him ."
"`` why are you still here ? ''"
"`` because of what you just said . ''"
"she stopped trying to hurt him , mainly because her heart was n't really into it and besides , it was n't doing any good ."
"the man was just too big , too strong and she could n't break through that blasted confidence he carried around with him at all times ."
"`` why ? ''"
"she whispered , out of energy and anger ."
"all that was left was the pain of his betrayal ."
"`` you just said that you only wanted me . ''"
"she blinked and looked to the side , her whole body stiffening with the fear of what that accidental admission might mean to him ."
"`` so what ? ''"
"`` you 're the only woman i 've wanted , for years . ''"
"she snorted and rolled her eyes ."
"`` that does n't really hold up under the light of scrutiny , rais . ''"
"he laughed and pulled her even closer , ignoring the stiffness that told him that she wanted him to leave her alone ."
"he 'd done that enough over the years ."
"from now on , he was going to go with his feelings ."
"`` i love you . ''"
"those simple words stilled her movements and she held her breath ."
"`` do n't say things like that , '' she finally gasped out ."
"`` why not ?"
"it 's true ."
"i 've loved you for so long it 's been almost painful at times ."
"i 've wanted you as my wife since you were sixteen years old ."
"but you were too young and you needed to get out and enjoy your life , experience the world a bit . ''"
"she pulled back and looked up at him , startled by that admission ."
"`` you 've loved me for eight years ? ''"
"he shrugged ."
"`` probably longer than that ."
"when you turned sixteen is when i understood what i was feeling for you was too strong for just a friendship . ''"
"`` why did n't you say something ? ''"
"she demanded , her hands un-fisting and flattening against his chest ."
"`` why did you wait so long ? ''"
"she was crying again , but this was different ."
"it was n't necessarily happiness , but there was that , somewhere deep down underneath all the other emotions that were spiking through her mind at the moment ."
"`` because you were too young ."
"what i was feeling was n't appropriate . ''"
"`` that summer ... . ''"
"she started to say , her mind focusing on her sixteenth birthday party with all of her friends around ... .he 'd let her use the ballroom in his house for the event and they 'd all been awestruck by the party ."
"he 'd been there , standing next to her dad ... ."
"`` you were looking at me strangely that night , '' she said with a whisper ."
"he grimaced ."
"`` you were hanging onto that boy and it irritated the hell out of me . ''"
"she laughed and a tear slipped down again ."
"`` i saw you and thought you were the saddest man around ."
"i was also angry with you for showing up at my party . ''"
"one eyebrow went up with that comment ."
"`` angry ?"
"why ? ''"
"she looked down , her fingers playing with the buttons on the front of his shirt ."
"`` because you did n't ask me to dance . ''"
"his fingers clenched on her waist as he shook his head ."
"`` i could n't rachel ."
"it was n't right ."
"you were too young . ''"
"he sighed heavily as he continued , `` and then you disappeared ."
"going off to college was okay ."
"i wanted that for you and i was proud of all that you accomplished ."
"but you did n't come back during the summers ."
"why did you work on those other farms ? ''"
"she bit her lower lip , wishing she could avoid telling him this but he was admitting so much , it was now her turn ."
"`` because every time i saw you , you had another brunette on your arm and it hurt too much ."
"i hated you those summers because there were so many women ."
"it was horrible . ''"
"`` by the time you turned eighteen , i 'd had enough but you were gone ."
"i could n't get in touch with you and you apparently did n't want to have anything to do with me . ''"
"he groaned ."
"`` damn you were so beautiful whenever i caught a glimpse of you ."
"i imagined you in the arms of so many men and it drove me crazy . ''"
"`` there were n't any other men . ''"
"`` i know that now , '' he said with a half smile ."
"`` but the past six years have been pretty horrible . ''"
"`` i know how you feel , '' she said softly ."
"`` i hated you every time you brought another woman back to your house . ''"
"`` i never brought them back , rachel ."
"they followed me and it was my only defense against telling your father that i wanted to marry you and drag you away so you could be my wife . ''"
"`` why did n't you ? ''"
"she asked , her eyes showing him how much she would have wanted that ."
"`` because you were too young , '' he said , shaking her slightly ."
"`` you needed to experience life and find out what you wanted . ''"
"she was shaking her head ."
"`` i 've always wanted you ."
"that 's why i had to leave , because i loved you so much and you just kept bringing those other women around ."
"and they all looked like me . ''"
"`` they looked like you because i was trying to replace you ."
"i wanted you so badly but i knew i could n't have you ."
"but none of them measured up to the real thing . ''"
"she sighed and leaned her forehead on his chest ."
"`` i still do n't like it . ''"
"`` then marry me , '' he said and reached into his pocket for the ring he 'd been carrying around for weeks ."
"`` marry me and become my wife , argue with me at every opportunity and let me fix the past six years that we 've missed by not being with each other . ''"
"she stared at the ring , her breath caught in her throat as he slid the enormous ring onto her finger ."
"it was heavy but it was also startlingly beautiful ."
"`` this is crazy , '' she said when she remembered to take another breath ."
"`` crazy good or crazy bad ? ''"
"he teased , bending low so he could look at her face , trying to determine what was going on inside that beautiful head of hers ."
"she looked up at him , tears streaming down her face and he inhaled sharply , his thumb reaching out and catching one of those drops ."
"`` do n't , rachel , '' he sighed and brought her closer ."
"`` mary me and i promise you 'll never have any reason to cry ."
"ever . ''"
"she laughed and hugged him closer ."
"`` okay , '' was all she said ."
"rais stilled , wondering if he 'd heard her properly ."
"`` was that a yes ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"she laughed through her tears but nodded her head , or as much of a nod as she could with his arms holding her so closely ."
"with that nod , all of the tension from the past few days disappeared ."
"he picked her up and spun her around , yelling with excitement and relief ."
"`` you 'll never regret this decision , '' he said and held her face between his hands ."
"`` i promise , i 'll love you so much you 'll be begging for mercy , '' he promised her ."
"she could n't help the giggle that escaped ."
"`` i 'm already so happy . ''"
"he smiled down at her a moment before he lifted her up into his arms ."
"`` you have no idea . ''"
"she threw back her head and laughed even as her arms wrapped around his neck ."
"`` i 'm sure you 're going to show me , '' she said ."
"the salacious grin that crept over his handsome features made her stomach muscles clench in anticipation ."
"`` oh , you have no idea . ''"
"chapter 1 there was that odd feeling again ."
"ella looked around the marble and glass lobby , wondering what could be causing such a sensation ."
"she 'd been working for six hours without a break already and her feet ached , her fingers were numb from typing in guest information and all she wanted was a sofa to kick her feet up on and a hot cup of tea ."
"okay , and maybe a bowl of soup ."
"and an ice cold glass of milk ."
"mentally , she sighed but outwardly , she maintained the pasted on smile as she greeted the next guest ."
"as one of several front desk receptionists at one of the best hotels in washington , d.c. , she knew what was expected of her ."
"she 'd worked hard to get into this position , even lying on her employment application ."
"the minimum age was twenty-one for this position and ella was only eighteen ."
"but she 'd had to do something ."
"she 'd moved to washington , d.c. from new york city and her old neighborhood had become too dangerous and none of the jobs she could obtain at her age could pay her enough to escape the horror of that life ."
"ella now took pride in being one of the best front desk receptionists , despite her age , and she worked hard to maintain this position ."
"she sincerely prayed no one would discover her age ."
"she focused on the guests in front of her , checking them in as quickly as possible , ignoring that niggling feeling that kept hitting the back of her neck ."
"what was wrong with her today ?"
"she was n't usually this distracted !"
"looking around , she noted that the end of the line for people trying to check in was finally getting shorter ."
"thankfully , she counted out the people in line and calculated that she had approximately one more hour before things would slow down ."
"with a sigh of relief , she handed her current guests their room keys , explained all the normal details about the hotel and politely directed them to the elevators ."
"the next guest moved forward and she pasted her normal bright smile on her face ."
"that strange sensation returned and she looked around , distracted once again ."
"why could n't she focus ?"
"pushing the niggling moment out of her mind , she took the new guest 's credit card , checking them in as efficiently as possible ."
"at one moment , she actually reached up to brush the back of her neck , wondering why she kept feeling that awkward , strange feeling ."
"it was almost as if ... .was someone watching her ?"
"she looked around ."
"no one was paying any significant amount of attention to her and she shook off the odd feeling ."
"too many mystery novels lately , she told herself silently ."
"the next guest moved to her station and she smiled , going through the whole process one more time ."
"again and again , she checked in the guests , smiling patiently while they asked the same questions , giving out the exact same directions over and over again to the elevators or bathrooms , her fingers flying across the keyboard ."
"she forced her mind to focus only on the next guest , ignoring that silly sensation that would n't go away as well as the heat and humidity that was seeping into the marble lobby as so many people walked in and out of the revolving doors ."
"the glass doors were made to keep most of the generally miserable washington , d.c. summer weather outside , but when the temperatures reached this level and with the height of the tourist season upon the city , the doors could only do so much ."
"this job might not be the most intellectually stimulating , but it paid the rent and helped her work her way through her first year of college ."
"it also kept her out of the gangs from her old neighborhood ."
"joining one of the competing factions definitely had n't been an option even though they 'd tried hard to coerce her into the life ."
"ella had left all of that behind and , if that neighborhood had taught her anything , it was that she could ignore unsavory characters and overcome difficult challenges ."
"if rude people or miserable weather was the issue today , she could rise above those problems and maintain her professionalism ."
"it did n't matter if they were selling drugs on the street corner or selling stocks on wall street , they all thought they could bully around someone smaller but she would not let them ruin this opportunity for her ."
"she was working her way through a check-in process when she once again felt something odd on the back of her shoulders ."
"looking around , she thought she was being silly ."
"and then she saw him !"
"he was striding across the lobby floor in a crowd of other men but she could never mistake that incredibly tall , amazingly muscular man !"
"it was him !"
"it was zayn !"
"he 'd disappeared ten years ago and everyone , including his best friends , dominic and angelo , had thought he 'd either been killed or arrested ."
"but no one had heard from him - he 'd just disappeared without anyone having any information , not even the police ."
"ella remembered that his friends had gone a bit nuts after his disappearance so long ago , searching everywhere , interrogating everyone ."
"and then they 'd just as suddenly stopped , no explanation and they had n't seemed concerned any longer ."
"ella had worried for several years about zayn 's disappearance but with no information , she had n't been able to figure out what had happened to him ."
"and now he was here , looking astonishingly vital and wonderfully healthy , more fabulous than he had all those years ago ."
"goodness he was tall !"
"and so very handsome !"
"those dark eyes and his tanned skin made him seem like some sort of piratical , romantic hero ."
"he 'd obviously done well for himself , she thought , peeking out from her lashes but looking quickly away when she realized that he was still staring at her ."
"her heartbeat increased frantically at that realization and she wanted to hide under the front desk counter but that was ridiculous ."
"this was zayn sarkis !"
"he had always been a complete gentleman ."
"she had no right feeling shy and oddly strange towards a man who had always been very sweet and protective of her ."
"dominic carson and angelo donati had worked their way out of the neighborhood as well ."
"now , they were both wealthy men who made it into the business and gossip news occasionally which made ella proud , even though she had n't ever been as close to them as she had been with zayn ."
"why was he here ?"
"and wow !"
"he looked fabulous !"
"her hungry eyes followed him across the elegant lobby , wondering how she could say hello to him without her manager seeing ."
"personal conversations with the hotel guests were a major violation of hotel policy , she knew ."
"but she could n't take her eyes off of the man ."
"he looked so wonderful and he 'd been the sweetest , kindest , gentlest man from that horrible , old neighborhood ."
"she thought fondly of how he used to meet her at school every day for an entire week when one of her third grade classmates was bullying her ."
"he 'd stood up for her , walked her through the streets , helped her carry the groceries home from the store when her mother had sent her with a larger than normal list ."
"he 'd been her hero back then even though she 'd been only eight years old ."
"she 'd never understood how zayn had been able to just appear when he was needed ."
"he had been like a ghost all those years ago ."
"one moment she was facing her third grade nemesis alone , trembling with fear that julia miller would smack her down on her walk home from school and then the next moment , zayn was beside her , teasing her and telling her jokes to make her laugh ."
"it became known around the neighborhood that zayn protected her ."
"and by association , angelo and dominic would also watch out for her ."
"she was n't the only one they protected ."
"there were several girls , including some of the smaller , scrawnier boys who had received help from those three at the time ."
"those three boys had been demons in the neighborhood and no one , absolutely no one , messed with any of them ."
"they stole cars to make money , stole anything they could get their hands on actually ."
"they had a network of spies all over the area and knew anything that was happening ."
"good grief , those three seemed to know what was going on even before it occurred !"
"now that she thought about it , the neighborhood had started going downhill as soon as those three boys had left ."
"first , zayn had left , just vanished with no one knowing anything about what had happened ."
"then dominic and angelo had started to succeed in their business ventures ."
"they 'd grown and invested and done so well for themselves and all of the residents from the old neighborhood liked to brag about how `` they knew dominic carson and angelo donati when ... '' ."
"those two were completely legitimate now and she was so proud of them ."
"they were her inspiration ."
"if they could do it , she knew that she could succeed as well ."
"okay , so the three of them had already made their first million by the time they were her age ."
"she was just a late bloomer !"
"she was taking classes at the community college , just like they 'd secretly done ."
"she was working a legal job that paid well and had a decent career path ."
"maybe dominic and angelo had developed a different strategy but hers was working for her ."
"she knew they 'd started their own businesses ."
"angelo was huge into the pharmaceuticals industry , having a knack for chemistry and an instinct for science and scientific advances while dominic was more into real estate and investments , able to convince just about anyone to do whatever he wanted simply by talking to them , listening to their concerns and figuring out how to create a deal so that everyone came out a winner ."
"those two had done shockingly well over the years , accumulating wealth that was incomprehensible to her ."
"since zayn had disappeared without any word , she did n't know what area of expertise he 'd gone into , but he looked like he was doing fabulously well for himself as well ."
"she was n't in their league , but she 'd succeed eventually ."
"she 'd get there somehow , although probably not as high up on the food chain as those two ."
"she just had to find her passion ."
"but zayn !"
"she 'd always had a little crush on zayn ."
"she 'd known that he was one of those guys that the other neighborhood girls adored ."
"all three of those boys were pretty handsome , but there had always been something about zayn that had captured her attention ."
"of course , she 'd been eight years old back then and he 'd been a dashing eighteen year old before he 'd mysteriously disappeared ."
"but it did n't matter ."
"she 'd thought he was a knight in shining armor , so wonderful and sweet , daring anyone to mess with the little people of the neighborhood ."
"she watched as he strode confidently through the lobby , stopping at the private elevators that were reserved for only the very wealthiest of guests ."
"in fact , that whole group stopped and waited ."
"when the elevator doors opened moments after they pressed the button , she watched with fascination as zayn stepped on first , ignoring the rest of the older men who surrounded him ."
"he must be an employee of those men , she thought with a secret thrill as she greeted her next guest ."
"he 'd made it out too !"
"he had n't gone to jail or to prison like so many of the others had speculated , nor had he died some horrible death at the hands of one of his enemies ."
"he was here and he looked amazing !"
"even more muscular and taller than before ."
"he must have grown another foot since he 'd left at eighteen which was pretty astounding since he 'd been crazy tall back when she 'd known him before ."
"just as the doors closed , his dark eyes sliced to hers and she almost gasped with surprise at the impact of that gaze ."
"his eyes were dark and , even from this distance , she could feel the danger emanating from those eyes ."
"something in her stomach started fluttering and she put a hand to her belly , trying to quell the ridiculous feeling ."
"this was zayn !"
"she could n't feel this for him !"
"she tore her eyes away and glanced down at the granite reception counter ."
"but a moment later , a fraction of a second before the elevator doors closed , she glanced up and he was still staring at her , still making those flutters go wild in her belly ."
"when the doors finally closed , she pulled her eyes away and realized that she 'd been holding her breath ."
"she filled her lungs with oxygen and turned back to the computer ."
"getting her mind back in gear , she forced herself to focus on the task at hand ."
"zayn looked wonderful , yes , but she could n't lose this job ."
"she knew that she would n't see him again , so it was best to concentrate and get her work done better than all the others who worked at the front desk ."
"she had to be friendlier , smarter , more considerate and more creative in helping her guests in order to stand out ."
"she had no idea what his business was with that group of men but she had a job to do and could n't be caught slacking off for any reason ."
"thankfully , another flurry of guests arrived at that moment and ella worked diligently to check each of them into their room or suite carefully and with as much professionalism as possible ."
"seeing zayn again gave her last few hours at the front desk an extra spark , allowing her to smile more brightly and be more patient as she gave directions to the lobby bathrooms for the fiftieth time that day ."
"if her eyes glanced around occasionally , she was n't trying to find zayn again , she told herself firmly ."
"she was simply trying to survey the lobby and determine when the rush of guests would abate ."
"her shift on the front desk finally ended at three o'clock that afternoon and she smiled tiredly at dorothy , her replacement for the night shift ."
"`` it was busy today , '' ella told her ."
"`` i just have room checks to do and i 'm out of here , thankfully . ''"
"dorothy was a nice woman in her early thirties with four kids ."
"she had the morning shift at home which enabled her to ensure that the kids got off to school each day with a hot breakfast and a warm hug while her husband worked the night shift at a gas station down the road ."
"he arrived home in time to meet the kids coming off of the school bus , feed them dinner , help each with their homework and tuck them into bed with another hug ."
"`` not as crazy as at my house , '' dorothy teased ."
"`` jeremy decided today was a good day to practice his trombone in his sisters ' room ."
"needless to say , there was lots of shouting going on before i finally got the little demons out the door to school this morning . ''"
"ella laughed but in truth , she was jealous of dorothy 's home life ."
"she had great kids that made her laugh , an attentive husband who worshiped her and she got to snuggle with her kids every day ."
"ella definitely wanted kids , she thought as she picked up the clipboard that contained a checklist for inspecting each of the rooms ."
"she just had to find the right guy ."
"she 'd love to have a whole houseful of children one day ."
"the tall , incredibly handsome man who had walked through the lobby today popped into her mind ."
"no , she told herself firmly ."
"zayn definitely was n't the right guy ."
"he had other priorities , but she smiled at the memory of him striding so confidently through the lobby ."
"she sighed and pushed through the long hallways , holding her clipboard in front of her as she went down the list once again ."
"she had three more rooms to check before she was finished for the day ."
"it was n't that she had big plans ."
"she was just going to sit in her tiny apartment and study , but she was still relieved to be leaving the hotel ."
"it had been a hard , busy day interrupted only by the excitement of seeing zayn ."
"when she entered the penthouse suite , she knocked first and called out carefully to ensure that no one was there ."
"it was her job to check the rooms and ensure that housekeeping had cleaned properly prior to letting the guests into the rooms ."
"ella went through her checklist , marking off the various items ."
"the team thatnormally cleaned the penthouse was good , which was the only way they could get onto this team ."
"it was a prime job because there were n't as many beds to make , the rooms were generally left in very good order so there was n't as much cleaning to do ."
"but whatever work there was , it had to be done extremely well ."
"this suite cost more per night than double her entire annual salary ."
"`` you 're very beautiful , '' a deep voice said ."
"ella jumped six inches off the ground , so startled she almost dropped her clipboard ."
"`` i 'm sorry ... i did n't think ... '' she was about to say that she had thought the penthouse suite was empty but when her eyes glanced up , she realized who it was ."
"`` zayn ? ''"
"she whispered , excitement fluttering in her tummy once again ."
"`` is that really you ? ''"
"she asked ."
"she could tell that he did n't recognize her ."
"she pressed the clipboard to her chest and smiled brightly ."
"`` it 's me !"
"ella cooper ."
"remember from the old neighborhood ?"
"you were my hero and saved me several times from a beating from julia miller . ''"
"there was a heartbeat of a pause , then she saw the recognition in his eyes ."
"and then the surprise ."
"`` ella ?"
"is that really you ? ''"
"he asked , moving forward now , his hand slipping out of his pockets as he took her into a gentle hug ."
"`` yes ."
"can you believe it ? ''"
"she laughed , suddenly trembling as his he bent down to wrap those hard , muscular arms around her ."
"why was she quivering like this ?"
"surely she was n't attracted to zayn as a man !"
"or was she just afraid of him ?"
"there was definitely an aura of authority surrounding him ."
"he 'd always been tough , but there was something different , an air of ... .power ?"
"she was being silly ."
"this was zayn !"
"surely she was imagining things ."
"she should n't be intimidated by him ."
"he was a sweet , gentle , kind man who would never hurt anyone ."
"she breathed a little easier when he pulled back ."
"she took a step backwards , needing the extra space just to see up into his eyes because of his height ."
"she ignored the excited trembling that invaded her body , pretending that this was just a friend , a guy she 'd known just about all her life ."
"`` where have you been for the last ten years ?"
"angelo and dominic just about went crazy looking for you after you disappeared . ''"
"zayn shrugged slightly ."
"`` i contacted them as soon as i could ."
"i knew they 'd be worried . ''"
"that actually hurt ."
"it meant that dominic and angelo were worth notifying of his circumstances but she had n't rated a call ."
"but why should she ?"
"she 'd been just a little girl back then ."
"maintaining her professional smile , she asked `` well , what happened to you ?"
"rumor had it for a while that you were arrested ."
"is that true ? ''"
"zayn laughed and ella was embarrassed by the way the sound made her feel ."
"she shifted slightly , wondering if he could tell that the sound had made her stomach tighten slightly ."
"and those darn flutterings were going full force now !"
"but then he smiled ."
"it was a bit rueful but , as she looked up at his handsome face , she could n't believe how that smile made her heart rate speed up ."
"`` i guess you could say i was imprisoned . ''"
"her eyes widened with concern ."
"`` oh my ."
"are you okay ?"
"you look ... '' she hesitated , unaware that her eyes were looking at him as if he were a piece of chocolate cheesecake before she got her libido back in check ."
"this was zayn she told herself again ."
"he was like a brother to her ."
"was n't he ?"
"okay , maybe a cousin ."
"perhaps a very distant cousin ."
"she looked at his broad , muscular shoulders , her breath catching slightly ."
"maybe the best friend of a distant cousin , she corrected ."
"`` i 'm okay now but i was pretty furious initially . ''"
"zayn looked at the petite woman standing in front of him ."
"she was smiling up at him as if he were some sort of relative , which was completely the opposite of what he was feeling for her ."
"he 'd had only a brief feel of her softness before she 'd pulled away , but that slight touch of her lush , full breasts pressing against his chest had whetted his appetite ."
"he 'd seen her several times during the day but she was much more beautiful up close ."
"and moments ago , he 'd been ogling her adorable bottom in her stiff suit before he 'd revealed himself to her and his body had reacted strongly to her delectable figure ."
"she had great legs too ."
"he wondered what they would look like if they were n't in those hideous , thick stockings and ugly , demure shoes ."
"she definitely was n't the frightened little girl he 'd walked home from school several days a week as a kid ."
"she 'd filled out in all the right places ."
"she truly was extraordinarily beautiful , he thought ."
"her high cheekbones and those striking green eyes were fascinating ."
"she was too short to be a model , but he could honestly say that he 'd never encountered a woman nearly as beautiful as ella cooper ."
"or one as strikingly elegant or poised ."
"she struck him as the ultimate beauty and he wondered why she kept all that dark hair hidden ."
"he remembered her having straight , almost black hair that she 'd pulled all of it back in a ponytail or a braid almost every day ."
"she now wore it pinned on top of her head but those soft , wispy tendrils framing her face told him that she still had the lovely , silky texture ."
"since it was restrained , he was unsure of the length but he suspected that it was still long and beautiful ."
"with that dark hair and her pale , white skin and gorgeous green eyes , she reminded him of some irish vixen , her long , dark lashes hiding her amazing eyes from his view but he wanted to see all of her , delve into all that she 'd become and learn all about who she had grown into ."
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` i saw you down in the lobby ."
"i suppose you work here ? ''"
"`` yes , '' ella replied , not sure how she felt about the situation ."
"she wished she could say that she 'd been more successful over the years , especially so she could impress zayn ."
"but there was nothing she could do about that now ."
"her life was n't as glamorous as she 'd like , but she was n't doing too badly ."
"`` i graduated high school early and am now attending college classes a few days a week . ''"
"feeling embarrassed that she had n't done more with her life , she changed the subject , shifting it away from herself and her lack of achievements ."
"`` obviously you 've done pretty well for yourself since you were released . ''"
"zayn chuckled slightly ."
"`` i do n't know if i can actually claim that i 've been released ."
"although i 've accepted the situation . ''"
"ella did n't understand what he was saying ."
"`` so what are you doing here now ? ''"
"`` i have some meetings over the next few days . ''"
"this meeting with ella definitely was n't going the way he 'd anticipated , zayn thought ."
"ella was asking about his past and he would really like to discuss their future ."
"he wanted this lovely woman ."
"the more he spoke to her , the more intrigued he was ."
"he 'd thought she was sexy and adorable when he 'd seen her in the lobby , but now that he could see her up close , see those sparkling green eyes and her soft , red lips , his mind was picturing her amid satin sheets , completely devoid of that unflattering uniform she was wearing ."
"he shifted closer , enjoying her sweet scent and noticing that her fingers were trembling slightly ."
"that was a good sign , he thought ."
"it told him that she was only pretending to think of him platonically and professionally ."
"that was good ."
"definitely giving him hope ."
"and more lustful thoughts ."
"obviously he was n't in prison any longer , she thought , relieved ."
"`` are you meeting with anyone important ?"
"maybe they could get you out of whatever pickle you 're currently in . ''"
"she smiled hopefully , feeling slightly breathless with him this close ."
"it was difficult , but she continued to mentally remind herself that she should n't be thinking like that about zayn ."
"he was probably a very busy man and he hopefully thought of her as a friend ."
"`` i wish i knew some important people who could help you out . ''"
"she had a sudden inspiration ."
"`` what about dominic or angelo ?"
"i know they 've been doing pretty well for themselves . ''"
"she knew she was rambling but she could n't seem to stop herself ."
"the way he was looking at her made her feel ... awkward ."
"she shifted her clipboard so it was covering her breasts , afraid he might notice that her nipples had hardened because of his closeness ."
"she blinked , trying to focus on his problem instead of the nervous way he made her feel ."
"`` i 've lost touch with them but i would be more than happy to help you find them ."
"and if i ca n't locate them , i have some money saved up ."
"i 'd lend it to you if it would help . ''"
"zayn could n't believe this ."
"he was ruler of one of the wealthiest countries in the world and this tiny little female , the one he 'd walked home to protect from mean little bullies , was offering to lend him money to get out of the bad state of affairs she thought he might be facing ."
"`` i do n't think either dominic or angelo could get me out of my current situation ."
"but i thank you for offering . ''"
"he took her hand in his and led her over to one of the down filled sofas , pulling her down next to him ."
"`` tell me what you 've been up to for the past few years . ''"
"ella sat stiffly beside him , painfully aware of the breach in hotel protocol she was creating by sitting here on the sofa ."
"despite her completely inappropriate and unprofessional fascination with the man , she did n't want to be here ."
"she wanted to jump up and stand beside this man , afraid to be caught fraternizing with one of the guests ."
"she did n't want to get him in trouble either with his employers ."
"she did n't understand what kind of trouble he was currently in but she did n't want to make it worse by sitting with him in his boss 's suite ."
"`` why do n't we go somewhere else and i can buy you a drink ? ''"
"she suggested ."
"zayn smiled slightly , more than intrigued ."
"he was flattered ."
"no woman had ever offered to buy him a drink ."
"or anything for that matter ."
"most women thought of him as a walking wallet ."
"`` that would be dangerous , '' he said softly and kept her hand in his larger one ."
"she was shivering he realized ."
"he wanted to put her at ease , but he was n't sure how to do that ."
"he 'd never met a more beautiful woman who was so completely unaware of her beauty ."
"he realized that the chemistry between the two of them was a bit more intense than usual ."
"he liked that about her ."
"her shyness appealed to him at level he 'd never been aware of before ."
"he wanted her , definitely , but he wanted her feeling confident about what might happen between the two of them ."
"`` would you like some coffee ? ''"
"he asked ."
"he raised his hand and immediately a waiter arrived by his side ."
"`` coffee and something to eat please , '' he said ."
"the waiter immediately moved away and ella panicked ."
"`` no , really , that 's okay ."
"i do n't really need coffee ."
"i ca n't ... '' `` you can , '' he contradicted firmly , telling her with his eyes that she should relax with him ."
"`` no , please , '' she argued , seeing bart , the all-knowing waiter , disappear through a set of doors that ella knew led to the butler 's pantry ."
"she was painfully aware that bart would be calling downstairs to alert her boss that she was sitting here fraternizing with one of the guests ."
"or more painfully , one of the guests ' employees !"
"her eyes sliced to the door behind which bart had just disappeared , then back to zayn ."
"as much as she would love to sit and chat with him , find out where he had been for the last ten years and how he had been , she could n't sit here in this beautiful suite next to him ."
"`` i have to go , '' she said firmly and tried to stand up but he kept her hand in his ."
"`` ella , sit down , '' he said sternly ."
"at her hesitation , he asked , `` have i ever let anything bad happen to you ? ''"
"ella immediately shook her head ."
"`` never , '' she whispered but her eyes were wide with the electric shock from his touch ."
"`` sit down and have a cup of coffee with me , '' he urged ."
"`` nothing will happen from a simple conversation . ''"
"ella sat , only because she was n't sure what else to do ."
"she did n't want to hurt this man 's feelings , but she really did n't want to lose her job ."
"`` please , let 's just get away from here and i can buy you a drink ."
"the coffee here is even more expensive than i make in a week ! ''"
"she joked , but not really ."
"she 'd wanted to horrify zayn but he just smiled slightly and held her hand more firmly ."
"`` and i really do n't want you to lose your job ."
"if your employers in the other rooms found out that we were sitting here , i 'm sure they would n't be very happy . ''"
"zayn smothered a chuckle at the idea of his advisors being upset with him entertaining a woman ."
"if they found out , they 'd probably lock the doors to keep her in here ."
"they 'd been pushing him to find a suitable wife for years but zayn had been too focused on getting the country under control and establishing priorities for growth , as well as getting all of his agencies on the same time table ."
"his advisors were desperate for an heir , especially an heir from him ."
"their dynastic thinking was that zayn was a strong , fair ruler so his offspring would be as well and the prosperity of tusain would continue ."
"`` i guarantee that it will be okay ."
"i 'll tell the hotel manager that you are a very valuable employee and he should give you a raise . ''"
"ella knew that any comment from one of the guests along those lines would only be viewed poorly , especially if bart mentioned she 'd been sitting with him having coffee ."
"she smiled but it was forced ."
"she fidgeted under his direct gaze because she knew she simply could n't be sitting here like this , even if this man was the most gorgeous , most amazingly handsome and sinfully attractive man she 'd ever seen in her life ."
"she had to get out of here before bart finished his phone call and she was fired ."
"`` really , i 'd love to find out what 's happened with you over the past ten years , '' she said and stood up , pulling her hand out of his as she took a step backwards ."
"`` but i have a great deal of work to do . ''"
"she wrote down an address on the corner of her checklist then tore it off and handed it to him ."
"`` here ."
"if you have time , meet me at this place , '' she whispered , looking behind her nervously to see if bart might overhear her statement or see her handing him the scrap of paper ."
"`` i get off at six and can be there by seven ."
"if you have time , that is , '' she said in a hushed , urgent voice and scooted back another step when he stood up ."
"`` i have to go . ''"
"with that , she spun around and walked quickly out of the penthouse suite , her head held high ."
"she was even able to nod politely to bart as she walked by the butler 's pantry ."
"he looked slightly startled by her abrupt departure , but she could n't stop to analyze his reaction ."
"she just kept walking out as quickly as possible ."
"until her shift ended , she was painfully nervous , wondering if either her boss might fire her for the slight breach in rules with zayn or if zayn himself might show up ."
"she was n't sure which would be worse , or better , or not good ."
"by the time she actually clocked out for the day she was exhausted ."
"leaning her head against her locker , she took several deep breaths , trying to get herself back under control ."
"a few hours later , ella slid into one of the seats in the back of the bar ."
"he would n't come , she told herself ."
"she was sitting here with her school books open , looking like an idiot as she waited for a man that suddenly terrified her ."
"but she could n't help glancing up every time someone walked into the bar ."
"her heart sank a little bit each time the new arrival did n't happen to be zayn , no matter how many times she told herself to stop hoping ."
"she sighed and shook her head ."
"why would a man like zayn come to a place like this when he could have any woman he wanted ?"
"and he could meet with them in beautiful restaurants or any bar in the city that catered to the rich and powerful ?"
"he obviously worked for someone very high up and he had a good job with them ."
"she should have given him the address to a nicer place , perhaps a coffee shop closer to the hotel ."
"no , that would n't have been good ."
"someone from the staff might have seen her with him and zayn was n't the kind of man that people did n't notice ."
"ella knew she would n't have been comfortable talking with him closer to the hotel ."
"`` i thought you were going to study , '' dennis called out from the bar , interrupting her mental castigations ."
"he was the owner who let her wait tables on the weekend and her nights off from the hotel to make some extra cash ."
"he was a sweet man in his late fifties that had seen a hard life , but had n't let the cruelty of that life batter his soul ."
"he was kind and generous and had practically adopted her when she 'd moved into the apartment building across the street three years ago ."
"she 'd struggled a great deal that first year , terrified of how she was going to pay her rent , buy food for herself , keep her job and still finish high school ."
"she had cried on his shoulder on more than one occasion but he 'd given her sage advice and helped her through it all ."
"she thought of him more as a father figure than a boss and she respected all he 'd done with his life as well ."
"she smiled wanly , wondering if she should tell dennis about zayn coming in ."
"biting her lip , she knew that she had to give him a head 's up ."
"he was very protective and might try and get rid of zayn if he approached her table ."
"it was improbable that he would come , but just in case ."
"`` i might have a friend stop by , '' she called back to him ."
"since it was a monday night , there were n't many customers except for a few of the usuals who hung out at the bar almost every day ."
"he looked at her skeptically ."
"`` you get your studying done , missy , '' dennis called back to her while he poured another beer for one of his customers ."
"`` on it , '' she called back with a smile for the sweet man ."
"she looked around at dennis ' bar , wondering how zayn would feel meeting her here ."
"he obviously was now used to much classier places , but it was n't too horrible here ."
"the tables were clean , dennis never allowed smoking and he did n't water down the drinks ."
"the alcohol might not be top shelf , but it was n't the rot-gut some of the other bars in the area served ."
"so dennis had a pretty good business going here with his loyal customers appreciating his honesty and better than normal service ."
"ella smiled slightly but she heeded his advice and looked down at her books ."
"she did n't take summers off like most of the other students , preferring to plow through continuously so she could get it done as quickly as possible ."
"she had a history quiz in two days and she 'd already written her paper for her english class , but it could use some tweaking ."
"there was no reason to waste energy hoping to see zayn tonight ."
"he most likely had better things to do with his time than meet a shy , painfully pale brunette at some dive bar in the wrong part of the city ."
"focusing on her schoolwork , she was busy taking notes , highlighting areas of importance and shifting her papers around so that she could study more efficiently when she felt that strange feeling again ."
"it was n't that the air stirred or moved so much as it became ... electrified ."
"she pushed her hair off of her forehead , tucking the dark , brown strands back behind her ear and trying to focus ."
"it was probably just the annoying gang members that snuck in through the back door , she told herself as she turned the page on her book ."
"dennis would take care of anyone that might cause trouble ."
"he was well known for promptly getting rid of the riff raff ."
"`` you are here , '' zayn said as he approached ."
"`` when my driver pulled up outside , i did n't think he had the correct address . ''"
"ella looked up , astonished that he had come ."
"goodness , he looked ... amazing !"
"and definitely out of place ."
"his tall , muscular physique alone stood out among the shorter , day laborer type of patrons sitting at the bar ."
"but his dark suit and snowy , white shirt definitely were of better quality than the tee-shirt and jeans crowd ."
"she stared as he approached , shocked at how incredible he looked and the terrifying impact his presence had on her body ."
"she tried to sit up straight , to look confident , but the closer he advanced , the more nervous she became ."
"she pressed back against the chair , suddenly afraid of the furious expression on the tall man 's face ."
"`` zayn ?"
"you 're here ?"
"you came ? ''"
"she said , not sure if she was happy or concerned ."
"he looked very forbidding ."
"he stopped in front of the table where her books were spread out , his hands resting on his lean hips and looking down at her as if he were furious for some reason ."
"`` of course i came ."
"but i was sure you 'd given me the wrong address . ''"
"`` this guy bothering you , ella ? ''"
"dennis called out from the bar ."
"ella noticed that dennis already had one hand under the bar and she quickly shook her head ."
"`` not at all ."
"this is my old friend from my previous neighborhood . ''"
"at dennis ' skeptical look , she smiled reassuringly and stood up , standing in front of zayn so dennis could n't hurt him ."
"`` he 's just a friend . ''"
"she silently begged dennis to not interfere and only relaxed when he reluctantly nodded his head , taking his hand out from underneath the bar where the long , wooden bat was kept ."
"dennis never hesitated to use that bat when someone was interfering with his business or one of his waitresses ."
"ella might be off duty , but he was still overly protective ."
"`` he 's fine now , '' ella sighed with relief , referring to dennis ."
"zayn was looking as if he wanted to pick a fight with the older man but ella did n't want anyone to get hurt ."
"`` please , have a seat , '' she said ."
"`` i 'll get you a drink ."
"what would you like ? ''"
"she asked ."
"zayn looked around at the dingy bar and shook his head ."
"growing up , he might have considered this place to be the perfect hangout ."
"but his tastes had become more refined over the past ten-plus years ."
"seeing how nervous and hopeful ella was , he did n't suggest a change in venues ."
"`` how 's the coffee here ? ''"
"he finally said ."
"ella laughed and her shoulders eased down somewhat ."
"`` sludge like ."
"you 'll love it , '' she said and spun around to get him a cup ."
"zayn watched as she leaned over the bar , her adorable bottom almost sticking up in the air as she grabbed a coffee pot that obviously was behind the bar ."
"he also noticed all of the other men watching her and he gritted his teeth ."
"why would ella allow herself to be ogled in such a way ?"
"he 'd seen her only briefly this afternoon , but in those short moments , he 'd already decided that this slender beauty was going to be his ."
"she 'd struck a nerve inside of him , something he had n't realized was even a part of his psyche but he could n't ignore it ."
"in fact , she 'd been distracting him all afternoon ."
"every time he 'd tried to concentrate in his tedious meetings , an image of her smiling , fresh face came to mind ."
"he was actually in washington , d.c. for meetings with the president and his aides and he 'd canceled several of those scheduled for tonight in order to be here with ella ."
"he had n't even tried to stay away , knowing that seeing her again was more important ."
"he did n't understand why it was important , but he 'd accepted that and shifted his schedule ."
"for a man who prided himself on his focus and concentration , having that kind of a distraction seemed like a sign of poor self-discipline ."
"and he 'd worked very hard most of his life to attain absolute discipline ."
"for a woman to cause a lack of such was unheard of ."
"and why had he even noticed the other men looking at her ?"
"it was n't just that old habits die hard ."
"nor was it that he simply wanted this woman ."
"almost painfully ."
"no , there was something more to ella that he did n't completely understand ."
"he sighed and turned back , eyeing his guards who had come in with him and stationed themselves a few tables away ."
"they were forming a loose perimeter around the table , trying to appear casual but it was hard for large , bulky men like his security team to blend in ."
"they were trained to be obvious which discouraged assassination attempts but furthermore , their exercise and training schedule , as well as his own , caused all of them to be larger and more muscular than ordinary men ."
"thankfully , they were looking around at the other patrons so he did n't think they were aware of his poor concentration ."
"or his embarrassing fascination with this petite woman ."
"`` so , '' ella said as she carefully placed a cup of coffee in front of zayn then sat down with her own cup of tea across from him ."
"`` what have you been up to ?"
"and what happened to you all those years ago ?"
"i 've been dying to hear all about your adventures ever since i saw you earlier this afternoon . ''"
"zayn shifted the cup slightly , taking a sip ."
"he almost coughed at the bitter , unholy taste of the coffee ."
"he was n't sure when this brew was made , but it probably had n't been in this decade ."
"she had n't lied when she 'd described the coffee as sludge-like ."
"in fact , that might be insulting sludge ."
"pushing the cup away from him slightly , he focused on the amazingly beautiful woman in front of him ."
"when his eyes took in her lovely appearance , his body reacted to the soft blush that stained her pale cheeks ."
"as he looked down at her , he realized that it was n't that she was unhealthy , although she definitely could put on a little weight ."
"it was more that she just had very pale , almost translucent skin ."
"clearing his throat and shaking himself mentally , he focused on answering her question ."
"`` i 've been mostly out of the country , '' he replied evasively ."
"`` how is your mother ? ''"
"he asked , switching the subject away from himself ."
"ella told him about her mother 's death three years ago and he saw the pain in her eyes ."
"he wanted to lift her into his arms and cradle her in his arms , offer her comfort , but he was n't sure how she would react to that kind of sympathy ."
"`` where did you go after her death ?"
"who were you living with ? ''"
"he asked , remembering that she and her mother had lived alone ."
"he could n't remember her talking about any other relatives , but that might be because she 'd been so young , the subject had n't really come up ."
"`` oh , i survived , just like all of us , '' she said , waving aside the fact that her mother had died when she was fifteen and she 'd fought hard to stay under the radar of the children 's services division ."
"she 'd taken care of herself , working hard and studying , getting excellent grades and refusing to be broken ."
"something in her voice caught his attention and he stopped her ."
"`` ella , where have you been living all this time ? ''"
"he asked gently ."
"he wanted to reach out and touch her hand , even to pull her into his arms when he saw the pain and fear creep into her eyes ."
"but he restrained himself ."
"`` i took care of myself , '' she told him quickly ."
"`` what about your mother ? ''"
"`` my mother lives in florida right now . ''"
"he would n't let her move on from her last comment ."
"`` are you telling me that you 've lived on your own , paying the rent on that apartment and buying all of your food by yourself ? ''"
"he demanded , becoming furious with her for putting herself in that kind of danger ."
"ella looked taken aback , as if his question seemed odd ."
"`` of course i lived on my own ."
"i did n't want to be put into foster care ."
"you 're very well aware of what happened to angelo ."
"after his experiences , i doubt anyone from the old neighborhood would take that route . ''"
"zayn 's eyebrows drew down , revealing how furious he was ."
"not with her but with fate and the system that did n't protect her ."
"`` ella , how did you get by ? ''"
"`` i worked , '' she replied , looking down at the table ."
"`` i had several jobs and i studied hard ."
"it was n't easy , but i 'd much rather have that problem than ... '' she shook her head ."
"`` anyway , that 's in the past now ."
"i do n't want to think about it . ''"
"she quickly changed the subject and started telling him stories about the other people they both knew from the old neighborhood ."
"zayn had heard most of the stories because he spoke with angelo and dominic on a regular basis , but he listened and laughed , enchanted with ella 's telling of the foibles ."
"she was never mean about the recounting , or even malicious about the girls who had hurt her , the ones he 'd eventually protected her from ."
"he could n't help but chuckle as she told him about the kids that had been arrested , their trials , where they were in each of their prison sentences , who had gotten married , who had kids and any humorous stories about those kids she had heard through the grapevine ."
"when someone called out to her , she looked around , surprised that the bar had filled up so much ."
"`` goodness ! ''"
"she gasped and looked at her watch ."
"`` i 'm so sorry ."
"i 've monopolized your time for three hours ! ''"
"`` let me take you home , '' he said through the crowd ."
"he had n't noticed the passing of time , too absorbed in watching her facial expressions and enjoying the enticing view of her soft , full breasts whenever she leaned closer to him ."
"it was n't much of a view , but the conservative , cotton tee-shirt hugged her breasts just enough to tell him that she would be more than a handful when he finally freed those lovely breasts from the restraint of her plain , cotton bra ."
"he was still concerned about what she 'd had to endure after her mother 's death , but he vowed that he would make up for all of the problems she 'd gone through ."
"in that moment , he wanted to drape her in silks and satins , show her all that she 'd missed because of her abbreviated childhood ."
"ella gathered up her books and notebooks , shoving them into her plain , canvas bag before tossing it over her shoulder ."
"when he also stood up and started to help her , the trembling started once again ."
"`` you do n't need to do that , '' she said , suddenly nervous once again ."
"it had been easy to talk to him as he sat across the table from her , but it was n't so easy now that he was towering over her ."
"with her sneakers on , the top of her head did n't even reach his shoulder ."
"she felt small and nervous , anxious about the night ."
"`` i 'll take you home , '' he repeated when she 'd slung the heavy bag over her shoulder ."
"ella stood there in front of him in the dim light of the bar , her fingers twisting together and her body still shaking , even more pronounced now that they were standing and his height and all those incredible muscles were more obvious ."
"`` really , you do n't need to see me home ."
"i live very close . ''"
"`` of course i do ."
"what would dennis say if he knew that i 'd let you go home alone ? ''"
"ella laughed , staring at her feet because she was suddenly too shy to hold his gaze ."
"`` i live across the street ."
"joe is sitting in the doorway and he watches to make sure i get home okay . ''"
"zayn 's eyebrow went up ."
"`` you live across the street ?"
"from here ? ''"
"he demanded , once again angry at what she was enduring ."
"ella looked up at him curiously ."
"`` of course ."
"it 's a much better place than where my mother and i lived ."
"and of course , i do n't need that much room , '' she shrugged ."
"`` this place fits me better than the other apartment . ''"
"zayn knew that the apartment she 'd shared with her mother was about five hundred square feet ."
"there had been one bedroom , a closet-sized den area that had barely been able to hold a sofa , on which her mother had slept each night ."
"their kitchen had been smaller than the butler 's pantry in the penthouse he was staying in over at the hotel ."
"in fact , that pantry was more than three times the size of the kitchen ella had shared with her mother ."
"he also knew that the two of them had made the most amazing cookies in that tiny little space ."
"ella 's mother had baked them for him whenever she had some extra cash , a sort of thank you to him for looking out for her little girl ."
"zayn moved closer , his hand coming up to touch her cheek ."
"`` you 've had a hard time of it , have n't you , my beauty ? ''"
"ella was so flustered , she could n't even hold his gaze ."
"`` my life is n't nearly as hard as others , '' she whispered , wishing she sounded more confident ."
"`` i 've been pretty lucky , all things considered . ''"
"zayn did n't think so , but he was n't going to say that ."
"in fact , he wanted to wrap her up in silk and feed her chocolate for the rest of her days ."
"she was too soft , too trusting for this world , he thought ."
"`` let me get you home , '' he replied , his voice husky with concern and a sudden need to possess her , take care of her and give her everything possible ."
"they walked out of the bar , several of the men calling out to her ."
"ella waved to several of them but zayn noticed that she ignored other calls ."
"he suspected that those men were n't so friendly in their attentions ."
"he considered smashing their faces in just because he knew the type of men they were , preying on smaller women who were too nice to put them in their place ."
"but he followed ella out of the bar , making sure that the others could tell that he was there to watch out for her ."
"he glared at some , silently telling them that ella was not to be messed with , and then nodded politely to dennis ."
"`` you okay , ms ."
"ella ? ''"
"johnny called out from his wooden stool just outside the door ."
"johnny was the bouncer who ruled the outer perimeter of the bar ."
"dennis could take care of anyone inside , but it was johnny 's job to keep out the known irritants ."
"and he did an excellent job , knowing the neighborhood well enough to not allow entry to anyone who had been causing problems on the streets ."
"`` it 's all good , johnny ."
"how 's debbie ? ''"
"ella asked , referring to johnny 's wife who was eight months pregnant with their first child ."
"he groaned and rolled his eyes as if he were enduring much pain ."
"`` whining about swollen feet this afternoon ."
"that 's why i was here early , '' he said , winking and laughing ."
"ella shook her head ."
"`` you were here ten minutes late , '' ella contradicted ."
"`` probably because you were rubbing her toes again , were n't you ? ''"
"johnny just made some disgusted sound as if he thought ella was crazy to even suggest something so outrageous ."
"but ella knew better ."
"he worshiped debbie and she did the same back for him ."
"both of them were completely dedicated to each other and it was a love that ella hoped for herself someday ."
"ella stepped off of the curb and walked across the relatively empty street ."
"if it was a friday or saturday night , there would be cars driving up and down this street , searching for some sort of mischief ."
"but on a monday , it was calm and relatively clear ."
"even so , she shivered with awareness when zayn put a protective hand on the small of her back ."
"she could feel him turning his head back and forth to ensure that there were n't any cars coming , or any other threats he might have to deal with ."
"she smiled , thinking back to how sweet and protective he 'd been when she 'd been in third grade ."
"he was still protecting her now and she thought it was charming even though she could take now care of herself ."
"she 'd taken the free self-defense classes at the police station , used all the precautions and knew to be on alert and aware of her surroundings at all times ."
"one they were across the street , ella unlocked the door to the building and she turned to face zayn , not wanting to walk all the way up the narrow stairs with him ."
"but before she could even utter a thank you , he shook his head ."
"`` all the way inside , ella , '' he stated , meaning he was n't going away until she was safely inside her apartment ."
"she looked up at him and knew that he was n't going to argue with her ."
"he would simply stand there on the street all night until he considered her safe and sound ."
"`` why do men seem to think i 'm incapable of protecting myself ? ''"
"she grumbled , painfully self-conscious of walking up the narrow stairs in front of him in her jeans that had definitely seen better days ."
"she 'd had these jeans for several years and , unfortunately , she 'd gained just enough weight for them to be embarrassingly tight ."
"zayn almost laughed at her disgruntled expression ."
"if she only knew how many women would kill to be in her position , would she feel any differently ?"
"probably not ."
"ella was n't that kind of a woman ."
"she did n't like competition unless she was competing against herself ."
"but damn !"
"those jeans were ... .hot !"
"he actually had to grip the wobbly railing just to keep his hands from reaching out and cupping her perfect bottom ."
"he wanted her , no doubt about it ."
"he would n't do anything about it , though ."
"everything about ella screamed that she was innocent and he could n't take that away from her ."
"she was sweet and fresh and alive ."
"and he was a bastard for thinking such salacious thoughts about her ."
"he needed to clear his mind of all those things , all the things he wanted to do to her , and with her ."
"he watched as she fumbled with the keys , finally getting the right one into the lock and his mind instantly thought about what he wanted her to do with those pretty , white hands ."
"her nails were short but neat and her fingers long and elegant looking ."
"he could easily picture those soft hands against his chest , her fingers touching him , running along his arms or wrapping around his neck ."
"he had to pull his eyes away from those hands !"
"focus on something else , he ordered himself ."
"but that 'something else ' became her soft , red lips , perfectly shaped and his mind shifted away from her hands but he imagined her doing the same thing with her ... .stop it !"
"he took a deep breath but there was so little space in this narrow hallway that he just breathed in the clean scent of ella ."
"bracing his hands on the sides of the wall did n't seem to help ."
"he still felt himself leaning forward , his eyes watching her beautiful green ones , desperately hoping she would slap his face and tell him to leave her alone ."
"but all he saw in those dark , green depths was the same thing he was feeling ."
"and it did n't help him to pull back , to get out of that hallway ."
"when their lips touched , he felt as well as heard her gasp ."
"he was feeling the exact same thing but he was more cynical about the experience ."
"he did n't believe that he 'd actually felt that electric jolt ."
"he touched her lips again , waiting for the disappointment ."
"but that did n't come ."
"in fact , just the opposite ."
"with stunned surprise , his body was instantly hard and aching , desperate to have her just from that simple touch but he could n't stop , as much as he knew he should ."
"he pulled her against him and she felt even better than he could have anticipated ."
"she was so soft , so sensuous he wanted to lift her into his arms ."
"if he 'd been aware of his surroundings , zayn might have been surprised to find that he actually had lifted her into his arms , pressing her back against the wall and kissing her like there was no tomorrow ."
"but he was n't able to think , to slow down enough to make sense of his actions ."
"all he knew was that she was kissing him back and it was n't the sweet , gentle kiss of an innocent ."
"ella 's passion matched his , at least in intensity if not in skill ."
"later , he might think about things and realize that her kiss might indicate that she 'd never kissed a man before , but since she was so beautiful and sexy , at that moment , her never having been kissed was impossible to believe ."
"especially when she kissed him back exactly as he was kissing her , mimicking his movements and driving him crazy by wiggling against him , pressing herself against him ."
"ella thought she might just pass out with the heat that was driving her wild ."
"she could n't get enough of zayn ."
"his kiss was nothing like what she 'd thought it might be like ."
"she 'd expected him to be gentlemanly , kind and sweet ."
"this was not a sweet kiss ."
"nor did she want anything like that now ."
"she wanted him , just like this , ravenous for her , giving her exactly what she did n't realize she needed until he 'd touched her ."
"and when she felt that hardness lower on her belly , she shifted her body so that it was exactly where she needed it ."
"she could n't seem to stop , to be still and enjoy his kiss ."
"there was no enjoyment , it was sheer desperation to feel him , to taste more of zayn ."
"wrapping her legs around his waist made the ache better , but only for a moment ."
"because doing it ... yes ... just like that , she gasped when she shifted again ."
"and again ."
"she actually closed her eyes , shifting again and again against him , completely embracing the incredible feel of his body against hers , unaware of what she was doing ."
"`` yes ! ''"
"she cried out frantically , pleasure washing over her and she held onto him as her first orgasm shattered her body in a wave of pleasure so intense she thought she might actually pass out ."
"zayn watched , the pain of needing to bury himself inside her heat ... not really abating , but pushed back for the longest moment while he watched the beauty of ella in the throes of passion ."
"and they were both completely dressed !"
"damn !"
"he could n't believe what was happening ."
"this had never happened before but she was just so responsive ."
"so incredible !"
"he continued to hold her , pressing against her to prolong the feeling , giving her more of himself than he 'd ever given any woman before ."
"and he thought she was incredibly beautiful ."
"when she finally sighed , her body slumping against his and the wall behind her , he thought he might just explode himself ."
"but he gained enough control over his body to hold back , to realize that this was all wrong ."
"he could n't do this to ella ."
"not here , not like this ."
"she deserved more ."
"and damn if he was n't going to give it to her ."
"he bent down and kissed her neck but had to pull back quickly ."
"his control could only take so much stimulation ."
"`` goodness , '' she sighed , her hands smoothing down his shoulders ."
"and then realization of what had just happened hit her ."
"`` no , '' she whispered , squeezing her eyes closed ."
"she quickly dropped her legs , standing up by herself and trying to push against the large man , wishing she could just fall into the floor ."
"`` i 'm so sorry ! ''"
"she gasped out , covering her face with her hands ."
"`` i ca n't believe what just happened . ''"
"zayn wanted to laugh , but he was in too much pain ."
"`` please do n't apologize , '' he said , hearing that his voice was deeper than normal ."
"`` i thought you looked incredible . ''"
"she covered his mouth with her hands , shaking her head ."
"`` that did n't happen , '' she groaned ."
"`` we 'll just pretend like it did n't happen at all ."
"you can go back to your meetings and your boss ."
"i 'll just slip inside my apartment and cover my face with my pillow ."
"everything will be back to normal tomorrow . ''"
"he chuckled and shook his head ."
"`` that 's not really what is going to happen , ella , '' he said softly , his hands sliding up her waist , stopping just short of cupping those lovely , full breasts ."
"`` you 're going to come out to dinner with me tomorrow night . ''"
"ella quickly shook her head , refusing his command ."
"`` no ."
"that 's not possible . ''"
"she did n't know why it was n't possible , but she could n't face him again ."
"she 'd be perfectly happy if she never saw him again ."
"seeing him would just bring all of her embarrassment right back to her mind and she preferred to pretend like she had n't just been a wanton , crazy woman in his arms ."
"`` it 's not only possible , it is definitely going to happen , ella ."
"i 'll pick you up at the same time tomorrow night ."
"if you 're not here , i 'll just head over to dennis and ask him where you might be . ''"
"she cringed at the idea of dennis seeing zayn again tomorrow night ."
"dennis had already been wary of the man ."
"if he saw zayn again tomorrow night , there would be an interrogation ."
"`` fine , '' she groaned , still looking no higher than the middle of his chest ."
"`` but i 'll meet you somewhere ."
"do n't pick me up ."
"just tell me where to go and i 'll be there tomorrow after i get off work . ''"
"no reason to let anyone else in the neighborhood know that she was going to meet zayn again ."
"besides , dennis would see zayn from his front windows and the interrogation would start as soon as she came in for work friday night ."
"he 'd be an absolute bear about it , she just knew it ."
"better to just meet zayn for dinner somewhere else ."
"he 'd be out of town in no time and ella could get back to her normal , if sometimes trying , life ."
"zayn considered her suggestion for a moment ."
"he knew she was embarrassed and until he had her sitting down across the table from him , he would n't be able to ease that embarrassment ."
"`` i 'll send a car for you , '' he compromised ."
"ella thought that might work ."
"besides , it would alleviate the cost of getting onto a bus ."
"`` okay , '' she sighed , wishing he would just leave so she could pretend that she had n't just done ... whatever one called what had just happened ."
"zayn laughed softly , understanding that she wanted him gone ."
"`` i 'll see you tomorrow night , '' he said and kissed the top of her head ."
"`` go inside and lock the door so i can hear the bolts slide into place , '' he commanded ."
"normally , ella would ignore anyone who tried to order her about but in this case , she just wanted to hide ."
"getting into her apartment and locking the door was exactly what she wanted ."
"so what if his order coincided with her desires ?"
"she slipped through the door , eager to just hide from him ."
"she leaned against the door , locked all of her bolts and slid the chains into place , relieved when she heard his footsteps move off down the hallway ."
"closing her eyes , she slid down the door to the floor , wishing she could start the whole night over again ."
"chapter 2 the following night , ella smoothed the cotton sundress over her stomach and hips , her fingers shaking slightly as she thought about seeing zayn again ."
"she wished she could have contacted him , called off tonight , but he had n't left her any contact information ."
"she 'd tried to call the front desk , but she knew the hotel policies and they would n't put her call through without some sort of identity ."
"they promised to take a message , but what was she supposed to say ?"
"if she 'd just said she was canceling her evening plans , would he even pay attention to the message ?"
"she suspected that zayn would show up anyway ."
"at least , the old zayn would have ."
"there had n't been many people in the old neighborhood who would have defied zayn ."
"when the doorbell rang , she glanced across her small space , her eyes wide and worried ."
"she could n't face him , she thought miserably ."
"not after last night ."
"what would he think of her ?"
"she 'd been so wanton , acted so promiscuously ."
"she blushed just standing on the other side of the wooden door , how could she even face him ?"
"`` open the door , ella , '' zayn 's deep voice commanded from the other side ."
"ella stared at the door , gripping the love seat behind her ."
"the trembling started once again , full force this time and she could barely catch her breath ."
"`` ella , '' he repeated after several moments of silence ."
"ella closed her eyes and took a deep breath ."
"pretend like nothing happened , she told herself firmly ."
"just act like this happens all the time , that it was nothing out of the ordinary ."
"she dated occasionally ."
"okay , so not at all , really ."
"the best she could say is that she held conversations with other men ."
"and that was generally only when she was in the checkout line at the grocery store and jessica , the normal sales clerk , was off for the day ."
"no , she was abominably low on flirting expertise ."
"`` ella , if you do n't answer the door , i 'm going to get the building manager to open this for me . ''"
"ella knew that ms. wertheim , the woman on the bottom floor who ran the building , would gladly enter into ella 's domain , always wanting to know everyone 's business ."
"ella was friendly to the elderly woman , but never told her anything that was going on ."
"ms. wertheim liked to spread news like a wind spreads seeds and by the end of the day , everyone would know that ella had received a man into her apartment ."
"ella walked over to the door and pulled it open , unable to look up into zayn 's handsome features ."
"zayn looked down at the incredibly lovely woman in the cheap , thin sundress that , nonetheless , looked astoundingly alluring on her slender frame ."
"he tried very hard not to chuckle as the pink color spread quickly from her neck to her cheeks , making her pale skin look like she 'd been in the sun for much too long ."
"walking into her space , he could n't help but notice how little furniture she had ."
"and what there was , she 'd probably found abandoned on the street and hauled home by herself ."
"taking her hand , he lifted it up to his mouth and kissed her knuckles ."
"`` you look very pretty , ella , '' he said softly , holding her close when she would have pulled away ."
"`` thank you , '' she replied , smoothing the dress down again ."
"`` i thought you were only sending a car . ''"
"`` i did send a car ."
"i just happened to be inside the car as well . ''"
"ella had n't anticipated the subterfuge , but what could she say ?"
"she was both thrilled to see him again , he pulse rate skyrocketing , and at the same time , still not ready to face him ."
"`` did you have a nice day ? ''"
"she asked , wanting to change the subject ."
"and get out of her tiny apartment ."
"it had always felt just fine for her needs , but zayn standing in the middle of her space made things feel shockingly smaller ."
"he was too big , too tall and muscular to fit inside this tiny studio apartment ."
"zayn understood exactly what she was thinking and wanted to help her out ."
"`` ella , you did n't do anything wrong last night , '' he said softly , moving closer and taking her hand in his , holding it with his large , warm fingers ."
"`` you 're a beautiful , responsive , normal female , '' he coaxed ."
"she wanted to just pull her hands out of his and move on , but he would n't let her go ."
"`` can we discuss something else ? ''"
"she pleaded ."
"he sighed , wishing he could do or say something to make her feel more comfortable ."
"but she was too skittish and he did n't think she would listen to him ."
"in all of his twenty-eight years , he had n't ever run into a woman who was as innocent , sweet and sensuous as ella but he was making a muck of the situation ."
"`` are you hungry ? ''"
"he asked instead , tucking her hand onto his arm and guiding her out the doorway ."
"he made sure she locked the doors before preceding her down the stairway , thinking the whole time that he was going to get her out of this place ."
"she was working too hard and pushing herself to make her way in the world , but he could do a lot to help her ."
"he did n't think she would accept his help , but he could figure something out to alleviate some of the financial stress she was under ."
"`` where are we going for dinner ? ''"
"she asked , trying to make conversation to alleviate her nervousness ."
"`` we 'll go to la tesata , '' he replied , holding the door to her building for her ."
"she stopped and stared up at him , unaware that her mouth had fallen open ."
"`` no ! ''"
"one eyebrow went up in surprise ."
"`` you do n't like italian ? ''"
"he inquired , but he specifically remembered how much she loved pasta ."
"it had been a major event when she and her mother were making spaghetti for the night ."
"as a young girl , she 'd practically danced down the street on those nights ."
"which was why he 'd told his assistant to get them a table at the very exclusive italian restaurant ."
"`` you know i love italian , '' she came back ."
"`` but i do n't think you could have gotten a reservation there ."
"the concierge at our hotel books tables there but he only gives them out to the very special hotel guests . ''"
"zayn almost laughed at her worried expression ."
"and he finally understood how his assistant had gotten the reservation so easily ."
"`` why do you think i 'm not one of those special guests ? ''"
"he asked softly , his finger touching her smooth , pale cheek gently ."
"ella gasped at the contact , looking up at him and blushing as those feelings from the previous night soared through her body once again ."
"and she was much more embarrassed by them tonight , now that she knew what could happen ."
"`` are you afraid of me , ella ? ''"
"he asked , amused by the idea , stepping closer and diminishing the distance again ."
"but he did n't want her to be afraid ."
"he wanted her to be proud of what they could make each other feel ."
"she bit her lower lip and tried to come up with a way to explain what he made her feel ."
"`` i think i 'm afraid of what you do to me ."
"i know that you would never intentionally hurt me , if that 's what you 're asking . ''"
"zayn smiled at her response ."
"`` let 's go , '' he said , knowing they needed to leave before he took her back into her apartment and forgot about dinner ."
"he pushed the door open and once again , ella stopped cold ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"ella was staring at the door to the limousine ."
"`` zayn , you borrowed your employer 's limousine ? ''"
"she asked , smiling sweetly up at him ."
"`` that 's very considerate , but not necessary ."
"i 'm already impressed with everything about you , '' she said , her green eyes lighting with happiness , all embarrassment gone with his thoughtful gesture ."
"zayn did n't miss his driver 's shocked expression when he heard ella mention a `` boss '' ."
"it was odd even to him ."
"`` ella , why is it so inconceivable that this might be my limousine ?"
"that this might be my driver ? ''"
"she hugged his arm slightly and zayn had to grit his teeth when he felt her full , soft breast press against his arm ."
"`` do n't worry about that , zayn ."
"i 'm not impressed by titles ."
"but la tesata is horribly expensive and i 've heard that their prices are n't worth the food ."
"let 's just go for a pizza ."
"one with lots of cheese and extra sausage ."
"okay ? ''"
"she suggested ."
"he almost laughed at her perception of him as a poor man ."
"`` i 'm taking you to la tesata , '' he answered her firmly ."
"`` if you want pizza , i 'll ensure that the chef makes you one with all the cheese and sausage you want ."
"deal ? ''"
"she was shaking her head , but he stopped her by simply handing her into the limousine ."
"`` i ca n't go there dressed like this , '' she answered , shocked by the very idea of appearing in the very elegant , very up-scale restaurant in a cheap , cotton sundress ."
"she sat primly on the buttery-soft leather seat next to him , worriedly looking up at him ."
"`` you can if i bring you there , '' he countered with absolute confidence ."
"she shook her head ."
"`` you ca n't embarrass the staff by bringing me into that elegant restaurant , '' she stated emphatically ."
"`` believe me , i 'm one of the staff that becomes embarrassed almost daily ."
"it 's horrible . ''"
"if she had put it any other way , he would have just ignored her and taken her anyway ."
"`` what kinds of things embarrass you ? ''"
"he asked , eager to hear more about her life ."
"she shrugged causally , but her eyes were twinkling with amusement ."
"`` maybe not so much embarrassment , but perhaps there are some guest proclivities that are shocking . ''"
"he laughed softly ."
"`` i have a feeling that it does n't take much to shock you . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` initially , that might have been true ."
"but i 've been working at this job for about a year now and , believe me , there are shocking things that occur in a hotel ."
"i do n't understand why people do some of the things they do , but it boggles the mind . ''"
"zayn knew that some people enjoyed hotels because of their anonymity , which released them from their normal moral codes , freed them from inhibitions ."
"`` i doubt that much would boggle my mind . ''"
"except for a strikingly beautiful woman like ella who was untouched at the ripe old age of eighteen ."
"`` so give me the juicy details . ''"
"she grinned , thinking back to some of the issues she 'd encountered ."
"`` well , the security guards see much more than i do , but there have been several occasions when i 've walked in on a couple ... being intimate , '' she said as if `` having sex '' were too graphic ."
"his eyebrows slashed down again as his anger surfaced ."
"`` what were you doing when they were in flagrante delicto ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she laughed softly at his term ."
"`` i have to check the rooms as they are cleaned and report back when they are ready for guests ."
"there have been several times when i 've knocked , announced myself and walked in on couples . ''"
"his eyebrow went up ."
"`` does this happen often ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she shrugged one delicate shoulder but moved on ."
"they continued to discuss the amusing things that occurred in a hotel until they arrived at the restaurant ."
"she looked out , her eyes looking worried and her hands once again trying to smooth out any wrinkles in her plain dress ."
"compared to the others that were walking into the restaurant , she looked cheap and poor ."
"`` zayn , i 'd really rather not go inside , '' she said carefully , unaware that her fingers were tangling together in her lap nervously ."
"zayn looked down at her , taking pity on her anxiousness ."
"he picked up his phone and said something in a language she did n't understand ."
"a moment later , he nodded and closed the phone ."
"`` a private dining room has been arranged , '' he explained and without waiting for her to say anything else , he stepped out of the limousine and extended his hand for her , not accepting any more excuses ."
"ella cringed at the extra expense but put her hand into his warm one and followed him into the restaurant ."
"a huge fuss was made upon his arrival , but she was relieved when they were escorted to a relatively large private dining room ."
"the view was extraordinary with large windows looking out over the potomac river with all the boats moving about on the water ."
"she smiled , delighted with the room ."
"`` this is lovely , '' she said , pretending that the cost would n't be an issue ."
"ella did n't dare order a pizza , but savored spicy , cheesy pasta in a delicate red sauce with all sorts of seafood as well as crusty bread that was drenched in garlic butter ."
"she 'd never tasted anything so delicious and could barely keep up her end of the conversation as she feasted on the amazing foods ."
"when the entire plate of pasta was gone , she sat back in her chair , delicately wiping her mouth with the linen napkin ."
"`` thank you , zayn ."
"that really was delicious , '' she said with a shy smile ."
"zayn leaned forward , enjoying her pleasure ."
"`` what would you like for dessert ? ''"
"he asked , thinking about what he wanted for his after dinner pleasure ."
"not to be , he reminded himself ."
"ella was barely a woman ."
"she deserved so much more ."
"ella shook her head and raised her hand ."
"`` nothing more , '' she begged with a soft , lilting laugh ."
"`` i could n't eat another bite . ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` you ca n't miss the chocolate delicacies here , '' he argued ."
"`` they 're incredible . ''"
"she laughed again ."
"`` you 're taunting me ."
"you know how much i love pasta and i 've already overindulged ."
"now you 're teasing my sweet tooth but it is n't going to work this time ."
"i am too full to even be tempted . ''"
"zayn raised an eyebrow at her challenge ."
"turning to the waiter who was standing by the wall , he said , `` pack up one each of all of your desserts ."
"we 'll try them later , '' he said ."
"the waiter bowed and left the room quickly , eager to fulfill the order ."
"ella rolled her eyes ."
"`` i guess you think i 'm going to fall for the chocolate trick , eh ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he leaned forward and poured her more wine ."
"`` i did n't know there was a chocolate trick , '' he came back ."
"`` enlighten me . ''"
"`` tempting a woman with chocolate ."
"but i 'm not addicted to chocolate ."
"so it wo n't work . ''"
"he raised an eyebrow ."
"`` i 've never known a woman who was n't addicted to chocolate . ''"
"`` ah , more proof that you 've been running in the wrong circles ."
"women of my social class ca n't afford chocolate ."
"so there 's no chance we can be addicted ."
"therefore , we ca n't be tempted . ''"
"he looked at her with determination ."
"`` i am going to change that . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` no , you 're going to continue doing what you 're doing , which is obviously something very important , '' she argued ."
"`` and i 'm going to continue to work on my degree and get a fabulous promotion so i will get off of working at the front desk which will mean i wo n't have to deal with all the horrible people that come through the hotel . ''"
"his head tilted to the side ."
"`` why do you work in a hotel ? ''"
"he asked gently , wanting to figure out how to get her into a better position , something that was n't as hard as what she was currently doing ."
"she shrugged her shoulders ."
"`` it 's actually a very good job with a relatively reliable career potential ."
"i earn more doing this than i did working at a fast food restaurant ."
"the customers are basically the same , '' she teased ."
"`` in an ideal world , what do you want to do ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she sighed and shook her head , her eyes changing ."
"gone was the light that had been there only moments ago , replaced by something different ."
"was it wisdom ?"
"or something worse ?"
"something defeated ?"
"or was she just a realist whose dreams had been pushed out of her mind because of the ongoing hardships she faced every day ?"
"ella leaned back in her chair , twirling her fork with her fingers ."
"`` i do n't play those games , zayn ."
"we do n't live in an ideal world , do we ?"
"are you doing what you dreamed of doing when you were younger ? ''"
"she paused , seeing the negative response in his eyes without him having to say anything ."
"`` so we both do what we have to do ."
"we get by , we push ourselves to reach a higher standard of excellence , and do a little bit of good whenever there 's an opportunity . ''"
"zayn knew that her words were true , of more than just the two of them ."
"people the world over did what they had to do to survive ."
"but he did n't want that for ella ."
"`` there are many people who have achieved their dream . ''"
"she smiled sadly ."
"`` i do n't think that 's in the stars for either of us ."
"do you ? ''"
"he stared hard into her eyes , wishing there was some hope , some small spark that continued to dream ."
"`` what happened to you ? ''"
"she shrugged one shoulder as if to dismiss his concern ."
"`` my life is n't nearly as hard as others , zayn ."
"working in a hotel is a great opportunity ."
"and at least i 'm not covered with grease from fried food or working out in the heat and humidity , or in the freezing cold ."
"i 've got it pretty good , '' she explained , smiling despite the sadness in her eyes ."
"he saw her smile , but there was a weariness to her eyes , a resignation that this was the best that life could offer her ."
"`` what happened to the little girl who danced home from school ?"
"or who would run down the stairs , tripping and falling , scraping her knees simply because she 'd made cookies and wanted to share ? ''"
"her smile disappeared and she looked down at the linen covered table ."
"she 'd loved baking cookies , but she had n't done that in over four years ."
"`` i used to make cookies with my mother , '' she said softly , fighting back the sudden tears that threatened to embarrass her ."
"`` i have n't made any cookies since she died . ''"
"`` you were a good cook , back then ."
"angelo , dominic and i would know when the two of you were baking ."
"we would purposely stand underneath your apartment window , hoping for handouts . ''"
"ella could n't stop the giggle at that admission ."
"`` you 're kidding ! ''"
"`` no way , '' he came back , his eyes smiling down at her ."
"`` when one of us got a whiff of the cookies , we 'd let the other two know ."
"and we 'd meet up , standing at mr. jones ' doorway across the street , waiting for however long it took for you or your mother to notice us . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` we were always making them for you three guys , '' she said ."
"then grimaced ."
"`` well , most of the time ."
"we liked them too ."
"but my mom would always wonder how it was that the three of you were standing by that doorway despite mr. jones ' horrible temper . ''"
"zayn grinned ."
"`` we 'd bribe him with other stuff , just so he would n't chase us away until we had cookies . ''"
"this was news to ella ."
"`` what did you bribe him with ? ''"
"she asked , fascinated by this new revelation ."
"zayn shrugged one shoulder ."
"`` whatever he needed ."
"one time , he just needed a lawn mower engine ."
"so we got it for him ."
"another time , dominic knew that his son was sick ."
"it was pretty easy to get him the amoxicillin he could n't afford . ''"
"ella 's mouth dropped open with that confession ."
"`` where did you get the medicine ? ''"
"she asked , leaning forward so her elbows were resting on the table , eager to hear more about this secret conspiracy ."
"`` we stole it , of course ."
"we did n't have any money back then . ''"
"her eyes widened ."
"`` you stole it ? ''"
"she gasped ."
"`` from whom ? ''"
"zayn shook his head ."
"`` oh no ."
"i 've told you enough of our secret , past life ."
"that 's all gone now ."
"and everyone turned out happy . ''"
"she could n't let it drop ."
"`` but you , dominic and angelo stole things ?"
"i looked up to you !"
"i thought the three of you were heroes !"
"always showing up with whatever someone needed whenever they needed it ."
"you stole the pain killers for mr. miller too , did n't you ?"
"so he could get his hip surgery ? ''"
"zayn leaned back and layered his hands on his lap ."
"`` mr. miller helped dominic with a history test once ."
"we owed him . ''"
"`` we ? ''"
"she asked , but knew that those three were inseparable ."
"`` of course ."
"dominic was smart , but he hated history ."
"mr. miller helped him , well , all three of us actually , to understand why history was important . ''"
"`` so you stole pain medicine for him so he could get through his surgery more easily . ''"
"she shook her head , her admiration for him growing tenfold ."
"`` i ca n't believe you were a thief ."
"but a good one , i guess ."
"and for good reasons . ''"
"`` it was more of a reciprocal system , '' he said ."
"`` the guys who stole for money , they got caught . ''"
"`` but since you three did n't steal for money ... ."
"? ''"
"`` oh , we stole things for money as well ."
"we needed cash sometimes ."
"especially when we could n't steal the things we needed . ''"
"he gave her a half smile ."
"`` do n't put us on a pedestal , ella ."
"we were n't heroes ."
"just guys on the street trying to survive . ''"
"again , that dismissive shrug ."
"`` officer melton turned a blind eye on several occasions ."
"as did several of the other shopkeepers ."
"they knew that we 'd help them out if they 'd just look the other way when we took something off of their trucks ."
"we only did that to the shopkeepers who had insurance though , or the ones who were receiving stolen property themselves ."
"or who we could give them something else they needed . ''"
"she considered his words ."
"`` so it was like a bartering system , more than theft . ''"
"he chuckled at her soft-hearted attempt to color his actions as noble ."
"`` if that makes you feel better about what we did , then you can call it a bartering system . ''"
"she could n't believe he was being so casual about his start in life ."
"`` what happened to you all those years ago ? ''"
"she asked , deciding a change in subject was better than pursuing the previous one ."
"`` why did you disappear so suddenly ? ''"
"she suspected that zayn would continue to picture his own actions as evil while the rest of the neighborhood considered him someone much more chivalrous ."
"she preferred to think of zayn as the robin hood type of man versus the mischief maker zayn sees in his past ."
"`` i 'll tell you , but you have to give me what i asked for first ."
"if you could do anything as a career , what would you do ? ''"
"he asked ."
"he thought she was sweetly naive , but with a hard shell of wisdom and cynicism ."
"ella bit her lower lip , her eyes glancing up at the ceiling to consider his question ."
"`` you 're asking something that is n't very easy to answer ."
"i do n't have a dream job so much as things i would like to do more often . ''"
"`` such as ? ''"
"`` well , now that you brought it up , i loved making cookies and other baked goods ."
"although i do n't know if i 'd be very good at it since my mother was the one who had all the skill and recipes . ''"
"his eyes widened ."
"`` please tell me that you know what she put into her chocolate chip cookies , '' he growled ."
"ella laughed at his stern expression ."
"`` yes ."
"i know what her secret ingredient was . ''"
"he waited for a long moment , looking at her and then grinned ."
"`` but you 're not going to tell me , are you ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she looked back at him aghast , her hand delicately covering her neck ."
"`` absolutely not !"
"a girl has to have secrets ."
"mine just happen to be what makes chocolate chip cookies taste better . ''"
"he chuckled softly , a sexy sound that caused her body to shiver deliciously ."
"`` then you 'll have to make some for me whenever i want them ."
"deal ? ''"
"`` no deal , '' she countered with a laugh ."
"`` if i remember correctly , you wanted them all the time . ''"
"the man had a voracious appetite ."
"and as she looked at him , the question popped into her mind ; what did his insatiable appetites lead him to at this point in his life ?"
"she blushed , knowing the answer already ."
"the man was astonishingly tall , breathtakingly gorgeous and had more charm than should be allowed in one man ."
"his appetites were definitely sexual and she could easily see him fulfilling those appetites ."
"with her actually ."
"he caught her blush and one eyebrow went up quickly ."
"`` what are you thinking about now ? ''"
"he asked , amused by all the possibilities ."
"surely she was n't thinking what he was thinking - that he wanted to kiss her until she was blushing everywhere and not just on her beautiful cheeks ."
"she waved both of her hands at him ."
"`` never mind that , '' she replied , her voice breathy because she was still thinking about him in sexual terms instead of the safer , more appropriate 'friend ' terms ."
"she glanced at her watch ."
"`` i 'd better go , '' she said and placed her napkin beside her plate and picked up her purse ."
"`` can i pay for my half of the meal ? ''"
"she asked cautiously ."
"she did n't want him to spend his whole paycheck on the dinner , but she had no idea how much everything cost ."
"she only had twenty dollars in her purse at the moment ."
"`` i might need to get some extra cash though , '' she said as she looked around for the waiter ."
"`` you 're not paying for this meal , '' he said firmly and stood up , coming around the table to take her hand ."
"she hesitated , still looking around for the waiter ."
"but they had disappeared , leaving the two of them alone in the room ."
"`` i ca n't let you pay for everything , '' she countered ."
"`` do n't we need to wait for the check ? ''"
"she asked as he started to lead her out of the private dining room ."
"zayn waved aside her concerns ."
"`` it has been taken care of , '' he replied , knowing that either one of his security guards or his assistant had already taken care of the bill for dinner ."
"`` let 's get some fresh air ."
"there 's a pretty park across the street . ''"
"he almost smiled as his guards heard the comment , knowing that they would dread having him out in the open ."
"if they had their way , he would be stashed away at the palace all the time where they could more easily control security around him ."
"he handed his suit jacket and tie to his guards as they stepped out of the air conditioning and into the damp , humid night air ."
"they strolled through the trees while ella asked him more about the pranks he did with his friends , angelo and dominic ."
"by the time they had walked back to his limousine , her sides were aching with laughter from all of his crazy stories ."
"those three had been up to much more than she 'd ever imagined ."
"when they approached the car , she knew that the night was late and it was past time for her to be getting home ."
"`` i guess this is the end , '' she sighed with regret ."
"her fingers were still resting on his arm and she wanted so badly to move her hand , to explore what might be underneath the expensive fabric , but she kept her fingers still , resisting the urge ."
"`` come back to my suite ."
"we 'll have a glass of brandy and sample some of the desserts that are waiting in the car . ''"
"ella was tempted , but she knew she could n't be found in his suite ."
"`` thank you very much for the offer , but i ca n't . ''"
"he ran a finger over her jaw gently ."
"`` are you still afraid of your management catching wind of your association with me ? ''"
"he teased ."
"she laughed and nodded ."
"`` i guarantee that they would not approve . ''"
"`` i can make sure that they do n't cause you any problems , '' he offered , moving closer ."
"he was relieved when she did n't move back ."
"he liked holding her like this ."
"perhaps too much ."
"but she shook her head ."
"`` it 's late , '' she sighed ."
"`` i have to study tomorrow morning and work the afternoon shift at the hotel . ''"
"he knew he should step away ."
"he should just put her into his car and drive her home , not touch her in any way ."
"but there was just something about ella that would n't release him ."
"as he looked down at her , her own eyes looked up and he knew that he was n't going to just drive her home ."
"there was a look in her eyes , something that told him that she wanted this as much as he did ."
"when he bent lower , slowly coming down to her level , giving her plenty of opportunity to push him away ."
"he waited , willing her to slap his face and tell him to go to hell ."
"he was ten years older than she was , almost thirty and she was n't even twenty years old ."
"but that did n't matter right now ."
"she felt perfect in his arms and he could n't stop when he touched his lips to hers ."
"at that first touch , ella knew she was lost ."
"she 'd tried very hard to think of zayn as a friend , to remember that he was n't from her world anymore , that he should be off limits ."
"but when she felt his lips on hers , she knew that she would die if he stopped ."
"she reached up , her hand touching his cheek , feeling the heat of his skin ."
"the electric shock that rippled through her at that moment was shocking ."
"she rose up on her toes , trying to increase the pressure but she should n't have worried about that ."
"at that same moment , his arm wrapped around her waist , pulling her higher , bringing her against his hard , muscular body and she shuddered , needing more ."
"her body remembered the previous night and ached to feel him like that again , to feel that pleasure , with him , all over again ."
"she pressed herself against him , heard the odd sounding groan but did n't pay any attention to it ."
"all she wanted was to feel him , to know that he was close and that they would continue doing this until this odd sensation deep in her belly ceased aching so painfully ."
"zayn lifted his head and shook it slightly , trying to remember where they were and who she was ."
"`` we have to go , '' he said with a gravelly voice ."
"he took her hand without any other explanation and pulled her along to the limousine ."
"he gently nudged her into the vehicle and followed behind , telling his driver to get them back to her place ."
"the driver took that order seriously and sped off into the night , leaving the decorous , elegant section of washington , d.c. behind them ."
"it took less than ten seconds before zayn knew that he could n't keep his hands off of her ."
"she sat beside him silently , her fingers tangling together and he pulled her into his arms , relieved when she practically jumped off of the seat onto his lap ."
"her arms were around him and her body was arching towards his own ."
"he could no more stop himself from kissing ella than he could extinguish all the stars in the nighttime sky ."
"the only thing that stopped him was the cooler night air hitting him and he looked up to realize that they were back at her apartment building ."
"he stepped out , then took her hand to help her out as well ."
"`` you 're home , '' he said as he took her hand ."
"ella blinked and looked around ."
"yes , they were back at her apartment and her heart sank ."
"this was the end , she thought sadly ."
"this would be where he politely walked her to her door ."
"he would then drive off into the night and she 'd never see him again ."
"she could see the truth in his eyes ."
"`` so it is , '' she sighed miserably ."
"`` i really loved dinner tonight , '' she said , wishing he would just take her back into his arms and make her feel wonderful again ."
"when he was touching her , kissing her , the world seemed right and sane ."
"there was hope and happiness ."
"but when he stopped , all the darkness and dinginess of her world returned ."
"`` i had a nice night as well , '' he said and pulled her closer once again , breathing deeply of the soft , sweet , `` ella '' scent ."
"there was nothing quite like it and he wanted desperately to bury his face in her hair and kiss her neck , kiss her throat , and move slowly downwards until ... ."
"`` i 'll walk you up to your door , '' he said , more firmly than he 'd intended ."
"`` thank you , '' she whispered , painfully conscious of john at his regular spot by the door of dennis ' bar across the street ."
"he watched everything , knew what was happening everywhere ."
"she waved briefly , then started up the stairs , taking her keys out of her purse along the way ."
"zayn walked behind her and just about shouted at the flirty little skirt in front of him on the damn stairs ."
"did she realize what she was doing ?"
"had she any idea of the invitation that dress had for a man walking behind her ?"
"damn !"
"with every step , that short little cotton thing flipped enticingly , never revealing anything but coming so close he had to restrain himself from touching the backs of her legs , from letting his hands slide up from that flippy little hem so he could explore everything underneath ."
"when she reached the top step , he could n't take the allure any longer ."
"lifting her up , he pinned her against the wall , growling at the surprised expression in those gorgeous eyes of hers ."
"`` did you do that on purpose ? ''"
"he demanded , his hands moving from her bottom where he was holding her against him , and sliding lower , his dark hand finding her pale , soft skin along her leg ."
"when his fingers discovered her prim , cotton underwear , he just about howled at the moon , his need was so intense ."
"`` do what ? ''"
"she gasped , but her mouth dropped open and her head fell backwards ."
"she could n't believe how erotic it felt to have his hands on her bottom , on the backs of her thighs ."
"she wanted him to move ... just a little to the right ... but he had other ideas and her hands were gripping his shoulders , her body shifting so that ... yes !"
"zayn knew exactly what she was doing and almost laughed at how transparent she was in the dim light of the hallway ."
"`` oh no , little one , '' he growled ."
"`` we 're not doing it that way tonight . ''"
"with that statement hanging in the air between them , he grabbed her keys and slid the right one quickly into the lock with one hand ."
"how he managed to pick the correct key with all of them on that keychain , he had no clue but he could n't stop right now if the whole damn building was burning down ."
"he carried her into her tiny apartment and slammed the door shut behind him ."
"with her against the wall once more , he shifted his hands , exploring her more slowly , more thoroughly ."
"her gasps of surprise and excitement were making him more than a little insane ."
"he wanted to be buried inside of her but he could n't seem to control their movements enough ."
"`` zayn ! ''"
"she gasped when he lifted his hand , sliding higher under her dress ."
"his large hand was cupping her bottom now , setting her body on fire ."
"she should be embarrassed by what he was doing , but the fire zipping through her did n't leave any room for embarrassment ."
"she just needed him ."
"she was n't sure how to appease this need , but it was causing her to ache in very strange places ."
"`` tell me what you like , '' he urged ."
"`` and where your bed is , '' he commanded in a more insistent tone of voice ."
"`` bed is in the sofa , '' she told him , leaning her head back so he could nibble along her collar bone ."
"`` do n't stop ."
"please , '' she begged ."
"`` i do n't intend to , '' he said with the same amount of urgency ."
"he looked around and knew he could n't get her bed out from the damn sofa one handed ."
"so instead , he sat down with her on his lap , her legs on either side of his hips ."
"this freed up his hands so he could remove the dress ."
"with a flick of a tie and one button , the whole thing just slipped down her shoulders ."
"since that was n't good enough , he lifted it up over her head and tossed it to the side ."
"seeing that white , cotton bra almost made him laugh ."
"she was so sensuous and the white cotton was the antithesis of what he pictured her in , but he could n't laugh ."
"not right now anyway ."
"he needed her out of that contraption and his fingers quickly dispenses with the ridiculous garment ."
"he made a mental note to have an entire silk , satin and lace undergarment wardrobe sent over to her ."
"but then his eyes focused on her , seeing her breasts for the first time ."
"her eyes were dilated and she started to cover her breasts , but he grabbed her wrists , gently pulling them back so she could n't hide herself from him ."
"`` do n't , please , '' he commanded with that husky voice that never failed to cause ella 's body to heat up several notches ."
"she shivered and relaxed her arms ."
"at first , she was nervous but as he continued to stare with a look of reverence in his eyes , she became proud , feeling strong and powerful that she could do this to such a strong man ."
"then he kissed her breasts ."
"it was just a slight touch , right on the tip ."
"and ella gasped , closing her eyes and arching her back for more ."
"she could n't believe it when he covered her breast with his mouth ."
"well , of course she knew that this happened , but she never , not even in her wildest dreams , could have imagined the sensation that shot through her body when his hot mouth caressed her nipple in such a manner ."
"it was the oddest , most insane sensation and she grabbed his neck , pressing her breast closer , silently begging him to continue ."
"when he moved to the next breast , she almost cried until she felt his mouth again and the intensity was even worse ."
"or better ."
"she was n't sure ."
"she could n't be still long enough to figure it out ."
"his hands moved from her back down to her hips , his fingers quickly tearing the cheap cotton away and baring her entire body to his gaze ."
"then his strong arms lifted her higher ."
"when she felt his mouth on her stomach , she shivered , her fingers splaying in his hair ."
"but when his mouth moved lower , she tried to shift away from him ."
"she could n't let him do that ."
"not that !"
"ella should have known better ."
"when zayn wanted something , apparently he did n't let anyone hinder his progress ."
"not even ella ."
"so when she started to pull back , to shake her head , he only smiled and moved her higher , his strong arms wrapping around her thighs and holding her exactly where he wanted her and his tongue took control of her body ."
"she writhed in his arms , not sure what was happening , only that she could n't stop screaming ."
"and when her body splintered apart , a repeat of the previous night but this time , even more intense , even more consuming , she was n't sure where she was any longer ."
"and when it was finally all over , when he allowed her to come down in his arms , she just about melted against him ."
"she tried to lift herself up , to put her arms around him and show him how much his efforts meant to her , but she could n't move ."
"her body was replete and she just smiled against his neck while his hands moved up and down her back and she listened to his rapid heartbeat under her ear ."
"`` thank you , '' she breathed when she was finally able to speak ."
"in response , he pulled her back and kissed her ."
"hard ."
"his body was n't giving her an inch of space or time to relax any longer ."
"and the moment he kissed her , every cell in her body came right back to life ."
"a part of her wanted to push him away , but the bigger part of her , the part that was now in control , sprung back to life , her whole body curling up like a spring , ready for round two ."
"`` i do n't think i can do this again , '' she mumbled as his mouth nibbled her neck ."
"`` i think you can , '' he countered and his fingers deftly unbuttoned his shirt ."
"`` give me your hand , ella , '' he told her ."
"ella eagerly pressed her hand against his skin , her eyes fascinated as his chest and shoulders were slowly revealed to her avid gaze ."
"`` you 're beautiful , '' she said as her fingers splayed open , her fingertips touching him everywhere ."
"`` may i ? ''"
"she asked but did n't wait for a response as she pulled the rest of his dress shirt out of the waistband of his slacks ."
"`` please do , '' he replied and inhaled sharply when he felt her slender , tentative fingers slide downwards , tracing the line of hair that disappeared behind his belt ."
"`` more , '' he told her ."
"ella completely agreed and she pushed his shirt off of his shoulders , her mouth following the trail of her hands ."
"but he only allowed her a moment of this pleasant pastime before he shook his head and grabbed her fingers ."
"`` i ca n't take anymore , '' he told her and shifted their positions ."
"then froze ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"she asked , worried by the startled expression in his eyes ."
"`` i do n't have any protection , '' he groaned ."
"he 'd purposely left the suite without anything because he did n't want this to happen ."
"`` we ca n't do this . ''"
"ella shivered , but smiled when she remembered the packets dennis had given her when she 'd first moved into this apartment ."
"`` yes , '' she sighed happily ."
"with a swift move , she leaned to the side and reached into the drawer in the side table , pulling out the line of foil packets ."
"`` dennis gave me these , just in case . ''"
"zayn almost laughed , but his relief was too intense ."
"instead , he grabbed the packets , tore one off and lifted ella into his arms , reversing their positions quickly so she was underneath him ."
"he cursed the tiny sofa but could n't stop himself ."
"tearing open the packet , he quickly stood up and undressed , unconcerned with where his clothes landed as he stared down at ella looking like a goddess with her hair flying out behind her , a rosy blush to her cheeks and her breasts as she saw a man fully naked for the first time in her life ."
"at least in real life , he told himself ."
"with a need he did n't completely understand , he came back to her , pulling her close around him and reveling in how perfectly it felt when she touched him ."
"when her hand once again followed the path of the dark line , he could n't take it any longer ."
"he grabbed her hand and held it above her head while his other hand positioned her hips ."
"with a gentle thrust , he pushed into her , careful to watch her face so he could see if he hurt her ."
"but there was only bliss on her face and , amazingly , it made his body harder , more desperate to be inside of her ."
"when he reached her barrier , he looked down at her ."
"gathering her close , he said , `` i 'm sorry , ella , '' a moment before he pushed through ."
"there was only a small gasp before she wiggled her hips ."
"`` do n't ! ''"
"he told her firmly , trying to be still so she could acclimatize herself to his invasion ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"she asked , biting her lip to keep herself from shifting ."
"if he wanted her to be still , she could do it ."
"at least for a few more moments ."
"`` because you 're sore , '' he came back , gritting his teeth against the need to move , to feel that incredible friction of her tight core around him ."
"she quickly shook her head , `` i 'm not sore at all ."
"please zayn ."
"do n't make me be still , '' she cried out , arching her back but keeping her hips as still as possible ."
"`` i do n't think i can ! ''"
"she was about to start crying , so desperate to feel him move inside of her ."
"that horrible ache was back and she did n't like it ."
"she could n't handle it ."
"she needed to appease that ache , to do something to get rid of it and her whole body was telling her that moving would help ."
"zayn looked down at her , at her flushed cheeks and just about climaxed at how perfectly sexy she looked ."
"her tiny body was straining , trying to do what he wanted but he could tell that she needed exactly what he needed ."
"to move ."
"`` ah ... ella , '' he sighed and shifted his hips ."
"he put one arm under the small of her back and the other arm was braced above her head against the arm of the love seat ."
"he had no idea where his legs were but he knew that he could n't remain still like this a moment longer ."
"he slowly pulled almost all the way out of her , then pushed into her hot depths ."
"over and over again his body moved , shifted , plummeted into her heat and he watched as she came closer and closer ."
"he knew the instant she was about to fall over the cliff and he would n't let her hold back ."
"shifting ever so slightly , he moved out of her and then quickly back in , taking her over ."
"when he felt her whole body climax around him , her cries of pleasure screaming out through the night air , he could n't hold back any longer ."
"he let himself go , pounding into her over and over again as he too reached that point where thought and feeling were meshed into one , pulsating , incredible orgasm ."
"ella had no concept of time ."
"it was only breathing ."
"one breath after another ."
"initially fast , erratic and then slower and slower until finally , her breathing was back to normal ."
"that might have taken minutes or hours , she had no idea ."
"she felt zayn shift , knew he 'd lifted her into his arms ."
"with her feet barely on the floor , she felt zayn hold her gently against his side as he tossed the pillows off of her love seat ."
"a moment later , he lifted her again , placing her in the middle of the tiny bed ."
"`` i 'm getting you a new apartment with a bigger bed ! ''"
"was the last thing she heard before he covered her mouth with his ."
"and the whole process started over again in all its mind-boggling intensity ."
"chapter 3 ella woke the following morning alone but with a huge smile on her face ."
"she pulled the sheet closer , stretching her legs and finding that she was sore in places she had n't known existed before the previous night ."
"she 'd heard zayn leave that morning ."
"apparently there was some sort of emergency he needed to attend to ."
"he promised he 'd be back ."
"she pushed one of the pillows behind her head and sighed with happiness ."
"zayn was the most incredible lover , she thought with a silly grin on her face ."
"the sun was bright over the horizon and she glanced at the clock ."
"then with a gasp , sat up straight ."
"it was almost noon !"
"she was supposed to be on duty at the hotel by two this afternoon ."
"that left her barely any time to get ready ."
"for a normal person , she supposed that two hours was enough time , but she had the public transportation system to deal with and that made her commute almost an hour and a half during some periods of the day ."
"she threw the sheet off of her and raced to her tiny bathroom ."
"she smiled as she washed the stickiness away , remembering the intimacy of the night before ."
"she could n't believe all the things she and zayn had done and felt herself blushing as she thought of what she 'd done to him the previous night ."
"or maybe it had been morning already ?"
"she had no idea , she thought as she jumped out of the shower and dried off ."
"she pulled on her uniform as quickly as possible , stuffing her makeup bag in her purse and rushing out the door ."
"she 'd have to do her hair and makeup on the bus and hope there were n't too many potholes ."
"she arrived at the hotel with five minutes to spare , still smiling despite the oppressive heat and humidity that made a person sweat just by sitting still ."
"the employee locker rooms were air conditioned , but not nearly as efficiently as the main areas of the hotel so she rushed through her check in process so she could get to the front desk and cool off a few moments before she needed to present herself to the guests ."
"she was fanning herself just outside the front lobby doorway when her manager , mr. tillsdale , came up behind her ."
"his nasally voice called to her ."
"`` ms. conner , please come with me , '' he said ."
"he did n't wait for her to turn around but disappeared into his office ."
"ella looked at the front desk area , then towards mr. tillsdale 's office ."
"with a sigh of resignation , she followed the odious , irritating man into his office ."
"she was n't nervous because she did n't think she 'd done anything wrong ."
"but a lecture about something was coming her way ."
"mr. tillsdale never brought an employee into his office without lecturing about one thing or another ."
"`` yes , mr ."
"tillsdale ? ''"
"she inquired as soon as she was standing in front of his desk ."
"she tried very hard to appear at least nominally respectful , but since the man was a lazy snob and bullied everyone else to do his job for him , she had trouble appearing in that manner ."
"he looked as if he were delighted by whatever it was he was going to say ."
"that look caused ella 's stomach to clench with anxiety ."
"nothing good could happen if mr. tillsdale was happy ."
"`` i 'm afraid your services are no longer required ."
"please turn in your badge and clear out your locker immediately . ''"
"ella stood there , stunned ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"she asked , her voice barely above a whisper since she was having problems getting the words past her lips ."
"`` you violated the hotel 's policy of fraternizing with the guests . ''"
"she shook her head , her mind reeling until she remembered two days ago when zayn had asked her to sit down and have coffee with him ."
"`` i 'm sorry sir , i told zayn ... i mean , mr. sarkis that i could n't sit with him ."
"he insisted but i politely excused myself ."
"i might have been sitting on the sofa for perhaps thirty seconds ."
"i certainly did not fraternize with him . ''"
"mr. tillsdale puffed himself up higher , his face turning an odd shade of red ."
"`` you will address him in an appropriate manner , or not at all ."
"and i was not aware of that particular infraction , ms ."
"conner . ''"
"he took a deep breath and turned a picture around on his desk ."
"ella looked down and saw her face ."
"the picture had been taken last night and showed her smiling up into zayn 's handsome face ."
"she must have said something amusing because he was almost laughing down at her ."
"`` i can explain , '' she said , the panic welling up inside of her ."
"this was n't a thirty second conversation during one of her room checks ."
"this was an obvious violation ."
"the manager shook his head and raised his hands , palms out ."
"`` i do n't believe that explanations are in order , ms. conner ."
"please do n't make a scene ."
"the rules were explained to you in great detail and the consequences as well ."
"you were told at the beginning of your employment here that rudeness and fraternization would not be tolerated ."
"both are considered grounds for immediate termination . ''"
"ella knew this ."
"it had been drilled into all the employees from the very first day of employment ."
"theft was also one of the top three but fraternization was one that did n't need to be proven by law enforcement ."
"and the picture was pretty damming , she knew ."
"she was in the man 's arms !"
"there was n't really any way to argue that she was n't fraternizing when even the picture looked like they were about to do something more than just stand there in each other 's arms ."
"`` yes , mr. tillsdale , '' she said softly ."
"turning around , she fought the tears that were welling up in her eyes ."
"it was hard but she finally made it to the employee locker room ."
"she was grateful that most of the people who were about to go on their shift had already left while the people who were coming off at two o'clock had n't yet made it down here ."
"she grabbed her purse and stuffed all of the contents of her locker into the bag , uncaring if the items were stuffed willy-nilly ."
"her priority was to get out of there as quickly as possible , to avoid the humiliation of her friends and co-workers knowing what she 'd done ."
"she reached the bus stop but had to wait more than twenty minutes before the next bus came ."
"in rush hour , the buses came more often but in the middle of the afternoon , they were few and far between ."
"when it finally arrived , ella was hot and miserable not to mention unable to stop the tears from falling down her cheeks ."
"she did n't know what she was going to do ."
"her rent was due and she had what she needed for the next few weeks , but jobs were extremely difficult to come by ."
"besides , she 'd had to lie to get that one ."
"who was going to hire her now ?"
"she did n't have a reference , she was only eighteen years old and she had done something horrible ."
"two hours later , she was climbing the stairs to her apartment , her heart breaking and fear clogging her throat as she tried to figure out what she was going to do to pay her rent next month ."
"she had to find a job ."
"fast !"
"just as she was unlocking her door , the building manager came out of her downstairs apartment , curlers in her hair and a flowered house-coat covering whatever might be underneath ."
"she even wore slippers that , at one point might have been fluffy but now , ella could n't even determine their original color ."
"`` missy ! ''"
"she called out , her elderly voice obviously furious about something ."
"since ella had n't done anything to ms. z , she was n't sure why the woman would be so angry ."
"`` yes ? ''"
"she asked , sniffing in the tears and trying to appear composed even though she suspected that she looked a mess ."
"`` you know the rules ."
"three noise complaints and you 're out !"
"gone !"
"i 'll expect you to pack up your things and find a new place to live before the end of the month since we received three complaints all last night ! ''"
"the lady huffed and puffed , her disgust for ella 's activities apparent ."
"`` i have no idea what you and that man were doing in your apartment that caused so much commotion , but it will not happen again ."
"this is a respectable establishment ."
"i do n't allow prostitution under any circumstances ! ''"
"ella gasped ."
"`` i am not a prostitute ! ''"
"ms. z waved her knobby finger in ella 's direction ."
"`` do n't even try it !"
"i saw the limousine parked out front last night ."
"it was there for hours !"
"with all the money you made servicing that guy , you can damn well find a different place to live ! ''"
"ms. z turned around and waddled back into her apartment , mumbling under her breath , `` knew the girl was no good right from the start ! ''"
"before she closed the door on ella 's horrified expression ."
"ella had no idea how long she stood on that stairwell ."
"but the next thing she knew , dorothy was helping her up off the stoop , helping her into her apartment and tut-tutting around the small space ."
"ella just sat at her tiny kitchen table while dorothy heated up a bowl of soup and put out some crackers ."
"`` do n't let them get to you , ella , '' dorothy said with heat ."
"`` tell me what happened . ''"
"through unrelenting tears and numb lips , ella related her entire day , starting with being fired and ending with being evicted ."
"dorothy shook her head and clasped her hands in hers ."
"`` okay , so you 'll move in with me and we 'll work something out , '' she said softly ."
"dorothy reached over and clasped ella 's hand ."
"`` we 'll get through this , okay ? ''"
"ella bowed her head in shame ."
"she could n't say anything more , just hoping and praying that dorothy was right ."
"the next month was a whirl of crazy activity ."
"somehow , ella found herself moved in with dorothy ."
"she slept in the woman 's basement and watched the kids in the afternoon so dorothy 's husband could get extra shifts in the evening ."
"that gave them all some much needed cash ."
"ella continued to work at dennis ' place and laughed at how horrified ms. z was when she was n't allowed in any of the stores along the street any longer ."
"the mean , nosy woman had to walk three blocks , just to get groceries ."
"dennis had spread the word about what the old woman had done to ella and all of the neighborhood stores were up in arms ."
"ella had helped out too many of the store owners while ms. z was one of those mean spirited women that no one liked ."
"apparently , all the other store owners were just looking for an excuse to ban the horrible woman from their premises and ella 's eviction was a good enough reason for most of them ."
"the real problem came though when ella sat down one saturday and looked at the calendar ."
"she 'd finished her semester at school and dorothy had convinced her not to look for another job ."
"since not working so many hours enabled ella to study more at school , she eagerly accepted the role of nanny for dorothy 's family , not even minding the cramped space in their basement ."
"it was actually bigger than her old apartment ."
"no , the problem was n't the lack of space ."
"or even the non-existent privacy ."
"it was that she was now three weeks late ."
"and ella was never , ever late ."
"chapter 4 zayn ran his hands through his hair in frustration ."
"`` what the hell do you mean , you ca n't find her ?"
"she worked at the front desk of the hotel we stayed in ."
"she was one of the most visible women in the hotel ! ''"
"zayn 's chief of security shook his head ."
"`` i 'm sorry , your highness ."
"ms. conner was terminated from the hotel 's employment the day we returned from washington , d.c. '' zayn 's chest constricted at that news ."
"he 'd been looking for ella for weeks now and no one had been able to find her anywhere ."
"`` so she 's working somewhere else !"
"she has to be ."
"she 's going to school , she 's an independent woman , she 'd never just go off and leave her responsibilities ."
"she had rent to pay , school fees to pay . ''"
"the chief looked down at his shoes , worried about passing along the next piece of information ."
"`` apparently , she was evicted the same day , your highness . ''"
"and then the man cringed ."
"in the past , men had lost their heads over news like this ."
"that was n't just a euphemism ."
"literally , their heads rolled onto the marble floor ."
"zayn took a deep breath , trying to control the worry that was threatening ."
"his ella was out there , hurt and scared ."
"he had to find her !"
"it was all his fault and he had to fix this not to mention he wanted her back in his arms ."
"`` then track her whereabouts through her employment records ."
"she has to be working somewhere . ''"
"the man shifted uncomfortably ."
"`` we 've already called in favors with our contacts at the internal revenue service ."
"if she 's working somewhere , it is off the books ."
"there is no official record of her anywhere ."
"there are no rental applications that have been submitted either , although we 're continuing to interview people she might have worked with to find her whereabouts . ''"
"zayn ran a hand through his hair in frustration , trying to give his chief of security something else that would help find ella ."
"`` there was a man across the street from her ."
"a bar owner or something ."
"the man looked out for ella ."
"he 'd know where she was ."
"i 'm sure of it ."
"just talk to him . ''"
"zayn was starting to worry ."
"had something happened to her ?"
"he 'd left her in the morning but by that evening , she 'd simply disappeared ."
"her landlady had been no help and now he knew why ."
"her employer had simply stated that she was no longer employed although he had no clue why they had terminated her services ."
"`` do you know why she was fired and evicted ? ''"
"again , the chief shuffled his feet , worried about the answer to his ruler 's question ."
"`` well , there seems to have been pictures . ''"
"zayn swallowed painfully ."
"`` pictures ? ''"
"he repeated , his mind going through all that he and ella had shared ."
"if someone had taken pictures of his ella that were in any way hurtful , he would hound that person until they were wiped out ."
"`` what kind of pictures ? ''"
"`` that second night ."
"when you and ms. conner were walking in the park , one of the paparazzi caught the two of you and snapped some photos ."
"our team found him quickly and removed the pictures so they never hit the tabloid circuit , but they found their way to the hotel manager somehow ."
"he used those pictures as justification for terminating her employment . ''"
"zayn was dumbfounded ."
"`` why would they care about a picture of me and ella in the park ? ''"
"he demanded , his anger rising as he started to realize that he was the cause of ella 's termination ."
"he hated the idea of hurting her , even inadvertently , but he had to hear all of it ."
"the chief took a deep breath before continuing ."
"`` there is a strict policy at that particular hotel , and many of the other high end hotels , to not allow any sort of fraternization with the hotel guests . ''"
"zayn felt like he wanted to punch someone ."
"`` and ? ''"
"he asked , his hands on his hips as he braced for the rest of it ."
"`` well , she was also evicted because of the noise created by ... . ''"
"the chief agonized over how to explain this debacle without being too obvious ."
"in the end , there was no way around it ."
"`` noise , your highness , '' he finally finished , his face turning red with embarrassment ."
"zayn was dumbfounded ."
"`` noise ?"
"ella is never noisy ."
"she 's quiet as a mouse ! ''"
"and then zayn remembered their one night together ."
"she had n't been mousy in any way that night ."
"just thinking about her responses made his body harden with need ."
"`` it was because of ... '' `` yes , your highness , '' the chief said , trying to contain his own reddened cheeks ."
"zayn sighed , his shoulders showing his defeat ."
"`` i understand , '' he said , furious with himself for doing this to ella ."
"of all the people he could have hurt , ella did n't deserve it ."
"it did n't matter that he had n't realized what he was doing ."
"the result was the same ."
"regrouping quickly , he looked down at his security chief ."
"`` so how are you going to find her ? ''"
"he demanded , trying to rein in his fury and desperation ."
"he had to find her quickly , to help her out and fix what he 'd done to her ."
"he could n't let her go on like this ."
"she was young , unemployed and homeless according to his chief ."
"`` we 're running into road blocks , '' the man was saying ."
"`` everyone we talk to from her neighborhood acknowledges that they know ms. conner , but they wo n't say anything else about her ."
"no one will give up her whereabouts even when we try and assure them that we 're not going to harm her ."
"it 's confounding sir ."
"i 've never known an entire neighborhood that would protect someone so completely . ''"
"zayn almost laughed at the other man 's frustration ."
"and it eased his frustration somewhat that ella was at least being taken care of by her neighbors ."
"it should be him though ."
"he could take care of her better than all of them ."
"he just needed to convince them of that , reassure them that he only wanted to overwhelm her with luxuries and never hurt her again ."
"`` do what you need to ."
"let me know what you need , '' he explained as he stared out the window of his office ."
"the view in front of him was astounding , but he was n't seeing the mountains in the distance , or the beautiful , well-laid out city beneath him ."
"all he saw was ella 's smiling face , her shining eyes and her sweet laughter ."
"`` consider this state business , but all expenses come out of my personal account . ''"
"he made a snap decision and turned his back on the view as he faced his chief of security ."
"`` we 've lost my future wife , '' he said , letting his security head understand the dire situation ."
"`` you should treat this as if she were my wife . ''"
"the man 's eyes widened and his shoulders straightened ."
"the message was loud and clear ."
"find ella cooper so their ruler can marry her ."
"and he would only marry this one woman , so the search needed to be intensified ."
"chapter 5 six years later ella sighed and pushed her dark brown hair out of her eyes , glancing at her watch to see how much longer until she was finished for the day ."
"there was still a long line of guests ready to check in for the night so she might be late again ."
"she certainly hoped not ."
"she did n't want to be late to pick up max ."
"she laughed silently at the memory of his adorable smile this morning ."
"he 'd been singing a song , one of those ear-worm songs that got into one 's head and would n't leave for the whole day ."
"he 'd been humming it during breakfast and she 'd told him to stop ."
"several times she 'd admonished him , but he 'd just stop , wait until she was turned around , distracted in getting ready for work , and would start again ."
"he sang just low enough that she could hear it , but it was n't something that was an immediate part of her consciousness ."
"when she realized what he was doing , she spun around and ordered him to stop once again ."
"by the time he 'd done it three times , she 'd given up , lifted him out of his breakfast chair and tickled him on the sofa until he was gasping for breath because of his giggles ."
"the little guy had gotten in the last word though ."
"she was hugging him one last time after dropping him off at first grade when he 'd called up to her with his arms still wrapped around her waist ."
"she knew he was up to something when she saw that grin ."
"he was such a handsome little devil ."
"and so smart it scared her sometimes ."
"but that grin was always the precursor to something that he 'd thought up in his creative , mercurial little mind ."
"she stiffened , waiting patiently for a split second ."
"then groaned when he started singing , `` and bingo was his name-oh ! ''"
"the little tike knew that he was in trouble so he raced into his classroom and surrounded himself with his classmates , giggling to himself as he shoved his books into his desk ."
"ella glared at him for maybe two seconds before she burst into laughter ."
"the problem with disciplining a guy as sweet and cute as max was that she had to be stern ."
"but he was so smart and ingenious , it was very hard to be stern with him ."
"besides , she just loved spending time with him and every moment seemed like a precious gift ."
"her manager stopped behind her , touching her shoulder ."
"`` you 're doing great , '' james said , snapping her out of her thoughts ."
"james was her manager , but also her boyfriend ."
"they 'd been dating now for six months and she really liked him ."
"he was a very kind man and she knew that he would be a good father for max ."
"she 'd been very protective of max over the years ."
"she did n't date often and she 'd vowed never introduced her son to the men in her life ."
"it was n't a big problem since she was generally too tired most days to date ."
"but she was thinking that james might be different ."
"even james had been pestering her to meet max but was this relationship really what she wanted ?"
"she did n't have much to compare it to ."
"only two , frantic , passion filled nights six years ago with max 's father and then a few insignificant kisses with men over the years ."
"was she asking for too much with james ?"
"she did n't want the passion that she 'd shared with zayn ."
"that had been a monumental mess to dig herself out of ."
"she 'd gotten max , who was wonderful , but it had been a desperately hard struggle over the years to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table ."
"so passion was definitely out ."
"not that she 'd experienced even a fraction of that passion with anyone else she 'd dated over the years , but she was n't looking for that ."
"companionship ?"
"was that enough ?"
"she definitely had that with james ."
"he was good company , they laughed together when they went out to lunch , he respected her relationship with max and her need to keep him safe from random men that probably would n't stay in her life ."
"when there was a break between guests , james walked behind her , pretending to work next to her as he said , `` think you could meet me for lunch today ? ''"
"he asked softly ."
"ella smiled slightly ."
"`` sure ."
"i do n't have any plans . ''"
"`` great , '' he replied and moved off towards his office ."
"she watched him walk away then cursed herself when her mind compared his slender frame to another man 's tall , muscular physique ."
"she hated that she found james lacking ."
"he was a good , solid friend and a kind gentleman ."
"why could n't she just fall in love with him ?"
"she knew that he would propose if she gave him even the slightest indication that she was interested ."
"why was she holding back ?"
"she shook her head as she welcomed the next guest , helping the couple through the check-in process as quickly as possible ."
"she had to thank max for getting her through the rest of the afternoon ."
"his adorable smile and mischievous ways helped her smile through the day ."
"just thinking about him made her want to laugh or chuckle ."
"zayn cursed as he walked through the hotel ."
"every time he came to this city , he ordered his staff to look for her , find some clue as to where she might have gone ."
"zayn was determined each time to finally find ella ."
"over and over throughout the years , he 'd thought about her , wondered where she was , what had happened to her ."
"and he 'd prayed that she was okay ."
"that she had n't fallen into bad times and been killed , raped or forced into an occupation that would demoralize her ."
"he 'd had an emergency that night so he had n't been able to stay and kiss her good morning ."
"by the time the emergency had been resolved , he 'd sent one of his men to find her but she 'd already been gone from both her job and her apartment with no clue as to her whereabouts ."
"he sighed and walked through the hotel towards his next meeting ."
"he had things to do and he should n't spend time fruitlessly searching for a doe-eyed beauty with lush curves and a smile that could light up the room ."
"there were plenty of women out there , he told himself , echoing the words of his advisors who were constantly urging him to find a woman to marry ."
"it had been six years since he 'd seen ella , it was time to move on ."
"unfortunately each time he 'd tried to picture another woman as his wife , the picture of ella 's green eyed beauty came to his mind and the woman on his arm simply left him cold ."
"chapter 6 zayn looked to the right , seeing the brunette out of the corner of his eye ."
"so many times over the past six years he 'd turned his head , hoping to see ella but it had always been another woman ."
"he was tired of looking for her now , wanting to see her , desperate to find her but frustrated with the fruitless efforts to date ."
"but when he turned , his eyes focused and he almost punched the wall beside him , unknowing that it was actually one of his aides ."
"he restrained himself , but just barely ."
"because the woman he was looking at was smiling up at a man in a dark suit , her eyes blatantly flirting with the older man and laughing at whatever he was telling her ."
"the fury that pounded through him was all-consuming and heated his blood ."
"the only other feeling he could say was similar was the first time he 'd kissed her ."
"and anytime he 'd touched her or she 'd touched him ."
"of course , he had n't wanted to punch her but the explosion of feelings had been the same ."
"damn her !"
"he 'd been trying to get her out of his mind for six , long years and here she was , looking more beautiful now than he remembered possible ."
"she was obviously older but the years had been more than kind ."
"she looked ... .perfect , he thought with a surge of lust so strong it almost resembled the jealousy he 'd just experienced ."
"he turned , heading down the same hallway she 'd gone down a moment before , unconcerned about his security detail trying to figure out what was going on ."
"he did n't care about the meeting he was supposed to attend , or the mission for his current trip , or even the frantic whispers of his security guards as they tried to anticipate where he would go next or why he was even deviating from their set path ."
"his eyes were on ella ."
"on getting to her before she disappeared again ."
"when she started to push open a steel door , he grabbed her by the waist and hauled her into a nearby corridor , only vaguely aware that it was empty ."
"`` what the ... '' ella gasped , her hands grabbing onto the steel band that had wrapped around her waist ."
"she was just about to scream when she realized who was holding her ."
"`` zayn ? ''"
"she gasped out loud ."
"zayn did n't even bother to answer her ."
"there was a brief moment of recognition followed by a thrill , but he did n't stop and wait for any other emotion to cross her beautiful face ."
"he pulled her up , pressing her back against the wall while his body pressed against her , pulling her closer , his mouth covering hers and absorbing whatever she 'd been about to say ."
"he did n't want to hear her words of explanation for the other man ."
"he did n't even want to know where she 'd been all these years ."
"well , yes , he would demand an answer to that soon ."
"right now , all he wanted was this ."
"as he kissed her , she initially resisted ."
"but he 'd had one full , incredible night with her and he shifted slightly , his hands moving to her back , holding her hips just so and with that one touch , that one shift of his body , she melted against him ."
"and gone were his hopes that he 'd been imagining her response ."
"gone was the possibility that their one night together had been a fluke ."
"more importantly , gone was the possibility that he would ever let her out of his protection again until he had her out of his system ."
"he 'd lost her once and she 'd haunted his dreams , feeding his need and making all other women pale in comparison ."
"feeling her soft lips opening to him , her hands in his hair and her tongue mating with his , driving him wild with need , he knew that he would have this woman ."
"tonight !"
"he pulled back slightly , noticing that both of them were breathing heavily but he did n't care ."
"his hands were under her silk shirt and he was feeling her softness , feeling her whole body vibrate against his ."
"`` come with me , '' he growled ."
"he lowered her to the floor , keeping his hands on her waist until he knew she was steady ."
"but the moment her eyes cleared of the sexual fog , he grabbed her hand and pulled her along down the corridor once more , heading to the penthouse suite where he would pull her into his bedroom and keep her naked until neither one of them could speak any longer ."
"ella realized she was already halfway down the employee hallway , her hand in zayn 's and he was pulling her in the wrong direction ."
"why was he pulling her anywhere ?"
"why was she letting him even touch her ?"
"she yanked her hand out of his , pulling back and taking several steps out of his reach ."
"she looked around and noticed the other men , all of them big and bulky and her fear almost choked her ."
"`` i 'll scream , '' she whispered ."
"`` what 's going on here ? ''"
"she demanded , trying to get her back against the wall so that she was n't feeling surrounded ."
"zayn realized that she was nervous of his security detail and nodded to the captain , silently indicating that they should pull away ."
"when they were alone once again , the guards looking out into the hallway at strategic points , he moved in closer to her , almost laughing when she put a hand up to stop him ."
"he took that defensive hand and held it against his chest , moving it against his body and enjoying the way her eyes almost closed with the bliss of their touch ."
"`` do n't do that , '' she gasped , suddenly wanting to pull her hand away , but his grip was strong ."
"and her fingers were finally touching his muscular chest , feeling the heat and reveling in it ."
"`` get away from me . ''"
"`` you do n't really mean that , '' he said and pulled her hand lower , wrapping her arm around his waist ."
"he leaned one hand against the wall , one large hand plastered over her head while he bent down low , breathing in her soft , feminine scent ."
"`` you want me to carry you off to my room just as badly as i need to do that too . ''"
"`` no ! ''"
"she gasped but could n't stop the need that sparked through her entire being ."
"she shook her head , gritting her teeth against the temptation , refusing to give in to it ."
"`` leave me alone ."
"you 've been gone for more than six years ."
"i do n't need you anymore . ''"
"`` yes ."
"you do , '' he countered softly ."
"`` we both need each other and that kiss just proved it to both of us . ''"
"she shook her head frantically , her mind remembering how quickly their touch could degenerate into a lust so intense that she 'd made love to this man on a love seat !"
"`` that kiss was n't anything . ''"
"he smiled subtly , eager to take on her challenge and prove her wrong ."
"`` do i need to prove it again ? ''"
"`` no ! ''"
"she cringed ."
"she had to think quickly , come up with some excuse so he would n't think she was easy ."
"she 'd slept with him on their second date two years ago and the results had almost been disastrous ."
"`` i thought you were someone else a few minutes ago ."
"i thought it was james kissing me which is why i reacted so strongly . ''"
"she lifted her head , daring him to challenge her lie ."
"`` i thought you were my boyfriend ."
"we 're getting married and i thought he 'd just ... '' `` you 're lying , '' he growled , coming in closer ."
"the idea of another man touching his ella , the woman he 'd been trying to find for the past six years , infuriated him ."
"`` you knew exactly who was holding you , who was kissing you ."
"do n't you dare deny it or i 'll prove it once again . ''"
"when he started to do just that , and her body actually leaned forward to anticipate his kiss , she braced herself and forced her mind to intervene despite her body 's desperate need to feel his kiss once more ."
"`` stop ! ''"
"she begged , closing her eyes and leaning her head against the wall ."
"she needed space and wisdom , two things that were in short supply right at the moment ."
"zayn shifted once again , his body just close enough to make her gasp in surprise ."
"and need ."
"`` are you going to lie to me again ? ''"
"she licked her lips , trying to figure out how to get out of this mess ."
"she could n't let herself fall into his arms again ."
"he 'd disappeared on her twice , neither time with any word or any explanation ."
"the first time , she 'd gone about her business , learned to stand up for herself ."
"the second time had been harder ."
"she 'd had so much more to deal with the second time he 'd disappeared and she could n't go through that again ."
"she could n't put max through it either ."
"she owed her little son so much more than just falling into bed with this man ."
"with as much willpower as she could muster , she jerked away ."
"`` leave me alone ! ''"
"she snapped and jerked out of his arms ."
"she stepped away from him , trying to control her breathing as she looked around ."
"`` why are you here ? '"
"she demanded , smoothing down her hair and her blouse , tucking it back into the waistband of her slacks ."
"she looked up at him , then down at his immaculate suit , obviously tailor-made to fit his enormous frame ."
"`` i have meetings here in washington . ''"
"she blinked and tried to take a deep breath , but with him standing so close , it was hard ."
"she fisted her hands at her side , determined to keep from touching him ."
"she would not , absolutely would not fall into bed with him again ."
"`` why are n't you at the other hotel ?"
"the one you stayed in the last time ? ''"
"she 'd been working here for a year now and she did n't like him coming even close to her personal or professional life ."
"the last time he 'd come into her life , she 'd lost her job , her home , such as it was , and had found herself pregnant ."
"she would n't trade max for anything , but zayn had disappeared at a time when she was vulnerable and scared , when she 'd desperately needed him ."
"she did n't know where he 'd gone or even how to contact him to give him the news about his son ."
"zayn was no longer allowed in her life ."
"he moved closer , shoving his hands into his pockets as he looked down at her , holding her in place without touching her even though he wanted to skim his fingertips over her cheek , smooth out her hair and ... `` is that why you left that hotel ? ''"
"he asked softly ."
"`` so we would n't run into each other again ? ''"
"had his team gotten it wrong about the pictures and her being fired for fraternization ?"
"it seemed much more likely that ella had gone somewhere to protect herself from him ."
"she inhaled sharply ."
"`` are you kidding me ?"
"i always thought you were such a nice man , so kind and considerate . ''"
"she glared at him as she thought about all he 'd put her through the last time ."
"how dare he stand there like that and say such a thing !"
"`` and now ? ''"
"she pulled her eyes away from him and suddenly realized what he 'd done to her appearance ."
"her silk shirt was pulled out from the waistband of her skirt and her jacket was askew ."
"she suspected that it was pretty obvious what he 'd just done to her ."
"she quickly buttoned her jacket , truly ashamed that she 'd let him make her look so disheveled ."
"`` and now , i think you 're a horrible human being who thinks only of his own pleasures , never even considering the chaos you might leave behind . ''"
"she closed her eyes and took a long , deep breath ."
"`` now , if you 'll excuse me , i have things to do and some place to be ."
"i do n't ever want to see you again , '' she said stiffly ."
"she turned around and walked back through the door she 'd been trying to get through before ."
"zayn watched her leave , admiring her spunk but never even considering the idea that he would let her get away again ."
"before she turned the corner in the employee area , he signaled to one of his guards , silently indicating that he should follow her ."
"`` do n't lose her , '' he commanded dangerously , the threat obvious ."
"he turned around and looked for ali , the head of his security detail ."
"`` find out anything you can on her ."
"where she lives , how long she 's been working here ."
"i ca n't believe your team did n't turn up her employment here , '' he snapped and walked back down the hallway ."
"he was angrier than he 'd ever been in his life except for the one day when he was eighteen years old and he 'd been ripped out of his previous life and dumped into his new one ."
"he 'd hated his father for so long ."
"first for abandoning his mother and leaving her to the cruel world , and secondly for coming back for him right when he was starting to really learn how to make it alone in the world ."
"he 'd been so furious about his father 's command that he learn to rule tusain that he had n't spoken to anyone for two weeks ."
"it had taken him that long to finally get in touch with angelo and dominic ."
"if it were n't for the two of them , he might still be fighting the fate that had killed his two older , unknown half-brothers and made him heir to the throne ."
"he had n't wanted it then and now , watching the woman he 'd been dreaming about for six years walk away from him , he once again resented the responsibilities that had been put on his shoulders ."
"he had to take a deep breath and remember the people of tusain ."
"they deserved better than this ."
"his adopted country had been through a lot and he 'd worked hard over the past sixteen years to get it back to health ."
"he would n't let them down ."
"but nor would he allow ella to walk out of his life ."
"he remembered the passion they had shared and it had never been matched , not even close , by any woman since ."
"his advisors were more than a little anxious , arguing with him almost constantly now to find a wife , to provide tusain with an heir ."
"he 'd simply ignored their pleas , still determined to find ella ."
"with a sigh , he walked back to the lobby and turned to the right , walking directly into the meeting that was already underway ."
"he took his seat at the head table , ignoring the curious glances of the other heads of state as he pretended to focus on the debate going on around him ."
"at this moment , he could n't care less about the debate ."
"he was more interested in figuring out ella 's last words ."
"now that she was n't in his sight distracting him , he wondered what chaos he might have left behind ."
"had something happened after he 'd left ?"
"was there more to the story ?"
"he remembered that she 'd been fired about a picture of the two of them but he did n't know the details of that termination ."
"and she 'd also been evicted ."
"he 'd worried about her , anxious that she was homeless and unemployed ."
"but she looked fabulous !"
"even better than before ."
"he 'd often wondered over the years if his memory had given him an altered picture of just how lovely she was but in reality , his memory had done the exact opposite ."
"she was even more alluring than he remembered ."
"and even better , had she actually been looking for him ?"
"perhaps he was n't the only one who had been resentful of the quick departure he 'd had to make the last time they 'd been together ."
"his attention was drawn back to the speaker , to the announcement of his name and the initiative his country was sponsoring ."
"amid the applause and the standing ovation , zayn heard the clanging in the background ."
"it sounded like an enormous pile of pots had just been dropped in the kitchen followed by an entire tray of glasses ."
"he was n't sure , but he thought he heard an outraged , `` are you kidding me ! ''"
"sprinkled in among the noise as well ."
"he focused most of his attention on the crowd , on the speech that was even now moving along the teleprompters but a part of his mind was focusing on the doors to the left where the kitchen staff entered and exited the elegant ballroom filled with the leaders of the world ."
"that 's where the noise had originated and he even saw several of his security guards along with a few more secret service agents hurry in that direction as well ."
"he almost smiled when he acknowledged that the chaos was probably cause by none other than his little ella ."
"he finished his speech , ending it with a bow to acknowledge the enthusiastic applause as well as another standing ovation ."
"he had to stay and listen to the various world leaders as they approached but he nodded to his aide , letting him know that the questions and answers had to end quickly ."
"there was a dinner scheduled for the evening and he needed to attend , but after that , he was free to pursue the little woman who probably had just discovered who he was ."
"he shook hands , debated mildly with some of the attendees and went through all the motions ."
"but by the time the dinner was finished , he was more than ready to get out of there and find his ella ."
"with a look from his chief of security , he knew that everything was in place ."
"as he walked down the back hallways , he focused all of his energy on coming up with what he was going to do to ella as soon as she was in his arms again ."
"the thought of spanking the dear woman for putting him through six years of waiting occurred to him ."
"but then he dismissed the idea ."
"he wanted her too painfully and he did n't want to start off this time with anger ."
"he did n't want to start their new life together with angry or resentful words ."
"he just wanted her in his arms again ."
"of course , he felt her deep down inside of him ."
"so deep he had n't been able to pry her smile and those vivacious green eyes out of his mind ."
"this time would be different from their last encounter ."
"he 'd get to her this time and he would n't let her out of bed until they 'd both found the relief that they 'd obviously been craving ."
"he knew she felt it too ."
"she might be dating that dough boy manager but there was no way she felt anything close to what she felt for him ."
"that one kiss in the hallway proved it beyond doubt ."
"he determined that he would use every bit of his expertise to get her back into his bed , back into his life ."
"chapter 7 ella paced back and forth , her anger taking over now that she was alone ."
"her apartment was n't big enough for her fury though ."
"the cramped space made it hard for her to really work up a good pacing path ."
"`` sheik ! ''"
"she hissed , trying to keep quiet because max had finally fallen asleep ."
"`` how dare he ! ''"
"she punched the throw pillow she 'd been clenching in her arms ."
"`` what an absolute jerk !"
"and to think , i 'd felt bad for him , assuming he 'd just gone to jail for some petty crime he 'd committed all those years ago ."
"when in reality , he was whipping up a good time with all of his lusty harem women in tusain ! ''"
"she could n't believe how stupid she 'd been !"
"how gullible !"
"she 'd been such an idiot !"
"she heard max sigh in his sleep ."
"she peeked in on him , looking down at the single bed in the only bedroom ."
"some of her temper suddenly dissipated as her heart filled with love for this little man ."
"he was only five years old , but he was precious and had made her life fuller than she 'd ever thought possible ."
"closing his door , she took the three steps back to her worn out sofa and slumped down onto the cushions ."
"looking around , she wished she could do better for max ."
"her own mother had been a single mother , barely scraping by each month ."
"she 'd worked hard jobs that had exhausted her by the end of each day ."
"but she always had a smile on her face , never complaining about their situation ."
"her mother had wanted a different life for ella and had worked so hard to push ella to get a better education , to learn everything she could so ella would n't have to deal with the low-wage jobs and abusive bosses like she 'd endured ."
"life was n't so bad , ella thought with a small smile ."
"she and max did n't live in a horrible section of the city ."
"they had a decent apartment , although it was small ."
"they had air conditioning in the summer which had been non-existent when ella had been growing up ."
"and they had plenty of heat in the winter ."
"they had a strong circle of friends who helped everyone out and things were n't too tough ."
"so what if she was in the same position her mother had been in !"
"things would be different for max ."
"first of all , she almost had her degree ."
"it had taken her lots of nights and lost precious sleep , but she 'd gotten through it and might even graduate with honors ."
"she had half a semester to go and she 'd have that degree ."
"after that , she 'd get a promotion at the hotel with that degree , she hoped ."
"that would mean more money and more freedom for her and max ."
"she 'd already started putting money away for his own college education ."
"she vowed that he would n't be in the same position she currently was in , trying to finish school and scrape enough money together for tuition ."
"it was n't much , but by the time he was actually ready to go to college she 'd have ... .okay so she 'd have one semester 's tuition paid for him at this rate ."
"but at least it was something !"
"stuffing the throw pillow under her chin , she looked around the neat , tidy little apartment ."
"it was better than what she 'd lived in growing up and the neighborhood was n't nearly as bad ."
"it was actually a very quaint neighborhood with lots of friends who looked out for max as well as herself ."
"and she looked out for them too ."
"it was a community !"
"the knock on the door startled her and she looked at the clock ."
"who in the world would be knocking at ten o'clock at night ?"
"surely not one of her neighbors ."
"they all knew she woke up about five o'clock in the morning , they would n't disturb her for anything less than an emergency ."
"with that thought in mind , she jumped up , racing to the door ."
"she did n't even bother to look through the security hole before she flung the door open ."
"she stood there , staring at the extremely large figure standing in the doorway , her mind not believing what her mind was telling her ."
"it was impossible , she told herself ."
"`` you ! ''"
"she snapped when her mind finally realized that zayn himself was standing there , looking down at her with both curiosity and amusement ."
"`` and it 's also you , '' he replied , his whole body relaxed now that she was here , in front of him and safe ."
"`` good evening , ella ."
"it 's been a long time . ''"
"when she tried to slam the door in his face , he simply put his palm to the door and pressed it back open , stepping into her apartment before closing the door behind him ."
"`` so this is where you live ? ''"
"he asked , his eyes taking in the tiny space she called home ."
"there was a bookcase along one wall and a sofa , but other than that , there was n't much other furniture besides an old chest that was used as a coffee table ."
"`` it 's very cozy . ''"
"`` thank you ."
"now get out , '' she snapped ."
"her eyes glanced to the only other door in the apartment , not wanting him to discover max 's existence ."
"instinctively , she knew she had to keep max a secret ."
"she had no idea where zayn had been all these years , but her discovery this afternoon that he was a powerful ruler seemed to terrify her ."
"she did n't know what kind of power he held , but she definitely did n't want to test it ."
"zayn looked down at her , saw the vulnerability there in her eyes and knew she was worried about something ."
"`` i 'm sorry you had to find out about who i am the way you did tonight ."
"i was going to tell you . ''"
"she did n't believe him ."
"he 'd had plenty of opportunity to explain his role six years ago and he 'd preferred to let her think he was a lowly employee ."
"not the head honcho of the whole , darn country !"
"`` when ?"
"tomorrow morning when i woke up and you were n't there again ?"
"maybe you could leave a note on my pillow ?"
"'ella - i was n't really in prison but thank you for worrying about me for ten years ."
"i have to disappear now to run a country ."
"see ya soon ! '"
". ''"
"she pulled back , taking a deep breath and trying to regain control of her temper again ."
"she turned away from him , shaking her head to try and release the anger , resentment and hurt she was feeling ."
"`` do n't worry zayn ."
"i do n't want anything from you ."
"i wo n't ask you for any money ."
"just leave me alone ."
"you did n't want me to know who you were or why you disappeared sixteen years ago and you did n't want me to understand six years ago ."
"i get it ."
"i 'm just ... '' he swung her about , holding her firmly by her upper arms as he pulled her against him , furious that she would belittle their one night together ."
"`` i did n't mean to abandon you that morning ."
"i was going to come back for you . ''"
"she tried to jerk her arms free but he would n't release her ."
"`` when ?"
"when i was a grandmother ? ''"
"she asked sarcastically ."
"but then she realized what she 'd just said and shuttered her eyes ."
"`` just get out of here , '' she told him with her voice lower ."
"max was a heavy sleeper , but their arguing could wake him up if they got too loud ."
"`` i tried to find you , '' he argued ."
"`` my entire security team looked for you ."
"but you disappeared yourself ."
"you were nowhere to be found . ''"
"he relaxed his hold on her but would n't let her go ."
"`` what happened , ella ?"
"were you angry with me when you woke up and found me gone ? ''"
"he did n't wait for her to respond ."
"his long finger trailed down her cheek as he said , `` i 'm sorry if i hurt your feelings ."
"there was a lot going on at that time . ''"
"she almost fell under his spell ."
"his touch was starting to get to her but she shook her head and pulled back ."
"`` i do n't care ."
"and where i was is none of your business ."
"just like you did n't think it was important to tell me where you were ."
"we were both adults , free to come and go as we wished . ''"
"she smothered the pain that welled up at the memory of how scared she 'd been that day ."
"she 'd woken up feeling so happy , so excited to see him again ."
"but she 'd gone to sleep that night terrified of how she was going to survive ."
"it had been a horrible twenty-four hours and she 'd desperately wanted a strong shoulder to cry on ."
"but he 'd disappeared ."
"again !"
"zayn smiled gently ."
"`` of course it 's my business ."
"especially if you 're angry with me for not getting in touch with you . ''"
"she closed her eyes and tried to push all her anger away ."
"it was n't productive and she had to get him out of here ."
"she had to protect max ."
"nothing mattered but max now ."
"`` i 'm not angry , zayn , '' she lied ."
"she was hurt and angry and furious with him , and she felt like the biggest fool in history ."
"`` it 's my fault , probably ."
"i should take the time to listen to the news ."
"you 're probably on the news all the time so if i had gotten my head out of the sand , i would n't have been surprised today and i would n't have known who you really were six years ago . ''"
"she did n't mention that her whole life back then had been about making enough money to pay for her medical bills and her tuition so she 'd barely had time to sleep much less watch television ."
"good grief , she had n't even been able to afford a television back then ."
"and even if she had , she would n't have wasted precious pennies on the electricity to run the darn thing ."
"he straightened up , flexing his shoulders to release some of the tension ."
"he 'd been up for over twenty hours now ."
"this conference did n't slow down state business ."
"he could delegate a great deal of responsibility , but many of the decisions had to come from him ."
"`` i 'll speak with my security chief tomorrow , to find out why he did n't find you sooner ."
"where had you gone ? ''"
"she felt almost sick with the terror of him finding out about max ."
"she stepped backwards but unfortunately , there was n't much room and her back was now against the wall ."
"she could n't tell him that she 'd gone away to give birth to his son ."
"what would he do with that piece of information ?"
"then a thought occurred to her ."
"did she really have the right to keep max from him ?"
"she loved that little boy so much but maybe max needed a father in his life ?"
"his own father and not james who was a good man , but was n't his actual father ."
"she was n't sure ."
"this was a new thought , one she 'd never considered before ."
"when zayn had left six years ago , she 'd been hurt and angry and terrified of what was to come ."
"she 'd never thought about telling him about max since she 'd had no idea how to get in touch with him ."
"this was a new concept , so she had to consider all the angles and ramifications of this issue ."
"but right now , she needed to get him out of her apartment ."
"she needed time and space to consider this new twist on her life and she could n't think clearly with him so close ."
"taking a deep breath , she pushed away from him and walked over to the small breakfast bar that separated her galley kitchen from the den area of her apartment ."
"`` zayn , let 's just leave it at both of us messing up , okay ? ''"
"zayn thought about that for a long moment , but something inside of him told him not to let it go ."
"she was hiding something he suddenly realized ."
"he thought he should be furious about that , but since he was n't going to lose her this time , he was n't going to let her push him away ."
"`` why do n't you come closer and let 's talk about it ? ''"
"he suggested ."
"he started to move towards her but the terrified look in her eyes stopped him ."
"`` what 's wrong , ella ?"
"why are you so afraid of me now ? ''"
"she swallowed painfully ."
"shaking her head , she glanced down at the floor , unable to look him in the eyes now that she had such a powerful secret ."
"she was starting to feel guilty about hiding max from him but she knew she needed to think this through , figure out what to do ."
"`` i was scared for you six years ago . ''"
"he nodded slowly , sifting through the puzzle ."
"`` yes ."
"but that was for a completely different reason , was n't it ? ''"
"she hated that he was so perceptive ."
"she could n't figure out all the problems right now ."
"it was late and she 'd been up for a long time now ."
"`` zayn , i do n't want to deal with this tonight ."
"i 'm tired and i have to get up early for work . ''"
"he reached out and pushed a lock of hair behind her ear ."
"`` you do n't have to work anymore , ella ."
"let me take care of you ."
"and you wo n't have to live like this either . ''"
"she looked around , wondering what he was talking about ."
"`` what 's wrong with this place ? ''"
"she asked slowly ."
"she was so proud of her neat little apartment , why would he think she 'd want to leave ?"
"zayn sighed ."
"`` this is n't what you want for yourself , is it ? ''"
"he looked around , astounded by how tiny her apartment was ."
"`` i can give you so much more ."
"come back to the hotel with me tonight ."
"i 'll show you how nice it can be . ''"
"she pulled back , her heart fluttering in her chest at the idea of having him close to her again ."
"but she did n't like what he was suggesting and it countered that ridiculous feeling she had trouble controlling ."
"`` let me get this straight , zayn ."
"you want me to come back with you tonight , sleep with you , let you take care of me by ... setting me up in an apartment somewhere ?"
"and you 'll come visit me ? ''"
"that was n't even close to what he wanted from her but he did n't think she was ready for a marriage proposal yet ."
"soon , he thought ."
"but not at this particular moment ."
"`` you make it sound unsavory ."
"but it does n't have to be like that ."
"let 's just get to know each other once again , figure out what we both like , talk ... '' she crossed her arms over her chest , glaring up at him , not fooled at all by his suggestion of 'talk ' ."
"`` what does it have to be like ? ''"
"she demanded , irritated with him now ."
"`` would you visit me when you have time ?"
"would i have servants to help me when you 're not around ?"
"would you shower me with presents like diamonds and designer clothes ? ''"
"zayn knew he was getting into trouble , but he was n't sure what was wrong ."
"and yes , all of what she was saying was exactly what he wanted to do for her ."
"he wanted to wrap her up and take care of her , show her that life could be wonderful ."
"`` of course ."
"anything you want . ''"
"she was bristling with anger now ."
"did he have no idea how insulting that suggestion was ?"
"`` and when i got sick , would you be there for me ?"
"would you hold my hand when i 'm scared ?"
"would you laugh with me when something funny happens during the day ? ''"
"she watched his eyes carefully ."
"`` of course not ."
"because you would n't be there most days ."
"in fact , you probably would n't even know if i got sick , would you zayn ?"
"because you have an important role in the world . ''"
"he would damn well care if she got sick !"
"`` of course i would care ."
"and i would know !"
"i have a great deal of responsibility but that wo n't mean that i wo n't be there for you ."
"are you going to condemn me for that ? ''"
"she sighed , feeling defeated and exhausted all of a sudden ."
"`` no , zayn ."
"i 'm not going to condemn you because of your life and your responsibilities ."
"but please do n't condemn me to the life you picture for me ."
"i could n't do it ."
"i would n't respect you if you put me into the role of your mistress ."
"nor would you respect me . ''"
"she pulled away from him and walked across the room ."
"`` i think you should leave . ''"
"there was no way he was going to let her go like this ."
"she was in his blood and he needed to figure out how to get her back to tusain , into his bed and safe in his mind so he could get on with the business of his country ."
"he could n't leave her ."
"he 'd been looking for her for too long to let her go now ."
"`` ella , that 's all well and good , but what are we going to do about this thing between us ? ''"
"he asked , moving closer to her ."
"he could see the pulse at the base of her throat , saw the rapid beating and knew that she was just as frustrated by their lack of touch as he was ."
"`` what about the fact that you do n't want me to leave ?"
"not really , '' he said softly and reached up to touch her cheek ."
"she almost laughed at that ."
"would have laughed if he were n't so painfully right and wrong ."
"`` believe me zayn ."
"i do n't want you in this apartment . ''"
"that was the truth , she thought and her chin went up as she looked at him ."
"something odd was going on ."
"he was n't sure what it was , but he would get to the bottom of it ."
"`` if you 're so sure that you do n't want me here , then tell me that after you kiss me . ''"
"that suggestion startled her ."
"kiss him ?"
"no way !"
"she could barely breathe with him being in her tiny apartment ."
"she could n't even let him touch her without breaking down ."
"her chin jutted out defiantly and she shook her head , not willing to even let him close to her ."
"`` i do n't think so ."
"just go , zayn . ''"
"he thought about it for a long moment , then slowly shook his head ."
"`` not until you kiss me , '' he countered ."
"with swift arms , he caught her up against him , pulling her close ."
"when their bodies were touching , he captured her gasp with his mouth , deepening the kiss with both his body and his tongue ."
"he realized the exact moment that she gave in to the kiss and he pulled her up higher , feeling her arms wrap around his neck ."
"his hands slipped under her tee-shirt , his mind completely focused on getting this woman naked so he could feast his eyes on her when he felt a sharp stab of pain on his leg ."
"he broke off the kiss quickly , spinning around and pushing ella behind him as he surveyed the room , protecting ella with his body ."
"a part of his mind knew he should call his security team , but he needed to move more quickly and eliminate the threat ."
"the thought of someone here trying to hurt him but accidentally getting to ella made him furious ."
"`` leave my mamma alone ! ''"
"a tiny , angry voice said ."
"ella was trying to push him out of the way but he kept pressing her backwards ."
"zayn looked around , then down ."
"it took him almost five seconds to realize that a brown-eyed , black-haired boy with his fists up in perfect fighting stance was glaring at him ."
"`` leave her alone ! ''"
"the little tyke growled ."
"zayn stared at the boy who was about five years old , his eyes taking in all the details , his mind refusing to accept the truth that was staring him in the face ."
"ella finally pushed her way around zayn and picked up the little boy ."
"`` max , that 's not polite , '' she admonished ."
"`` come on , little man ."
"it is late and you 're supposed to be asleep . ''"
"`` but i heard your voice , momma ."
"you were in pain . ''"
"max was obviously confused and she blushed furiously as she glanced back at zayn ."
"unfortunately , he was no help because he was still staring at max , his whole body tense as he worked through the newest twist in their fight ."
"`` come along , buddy ."
"i 'll tuck you back into bed . ''"
"max went , mostly because ella had him in her arms but he continued to glare at the tall stranger who had made his mother moan ."
"he bounced along over his mother 's shoulders , his brown eyes never leaving the similar ones of the strange , mean man ."
"ella tucked max back into bed , singing him a song until she knew that his eyes were closing ."
"`` i 'm okay , sweety ."
"there 's nothing wrong between me and that other man , '' she said softly when she could tell that max was fighting sleep ."
"`` then why were you in pain ? ''"
"he asked around a huge yawn ."
"`` i was n't in pain , my little love ."
"i 'm perfectly okay but i thank you for being so brave and coming to check on me . ''"
"`` you 're my momma , '' he said as if that explained everything ."
"she smiled in the darkness , feeling the love for this little guy almost overwhelm her ."
"if she had a choice , she would stay right here and watch him sleep all night ."
"but she did n't have a choice ."
"she had a very confused , very large and very angry man standing in her apartment ."
"she inhaled a deep breath , patted max 's hand one more time , then stepped out of the room to face zayn 's questions ."
"when she stepped out of the only bedroom and closed the door most of the way , she looked up to search for zayn , figuring he would be sitting on the couch or pacing the tiny confines of her apartment just as she 'd been doing less than an hour ago ."
"but he had n't moved ."
"not an inch !"
"he was still staring at the door where she 'd disappeared with max ."
"when ella stepped out again , his eyes sharpened on her face , his eyes snapping together ."
"`` who is that boy , ella ? ''"
"he asked softly , understanding instantly that he had to keep his voice down low ."
"ella clasped her hands in front of her ."
"`` his name is max . ''"
"she sat down on the sofa , uncaring if he was now towering over her ."
"he did that even when she was standing so what difference did it make ?"
"there was a long silence as zayn absorbed the name , tossed it around in his mind ."
"`` how old is he ? ''"
"ella took a deep breath before she said , `` he 's a little over five years old . ''"
"he heard the words , did the math in his mind and his confusion and anger welled up even larger ."
"zayn rubbed a hand over his face , his body tense and jerky ."
"`` ella , tell me what i need to know . ''"
"a tear trickled down her cheek as she nodded ."
"`` he 's our son . ''"
"she thought she heard him curse under his breath but she was n't sure ."
"she was too tense , too furious with him for discovering the truth ."
"and she was scared ."
"`` how ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"she laughed shortly but it was n't humorous ."
"`` i 'm not sure i 'm really able to explain it better than your science teachers , zayn . ''"
"`` how could this have happened , dammit ! ''"
"his harsh tone released her temper that had barely been held in check ."
"she stood up and glared at him , advancing on him angrily ."
"`` how could this have happened ?"
"do n't you remember that night ?"
"or was it such a short , inconsequential period in your life that it did n't rate a memory to you ? ''"
"she poked him in the chest ."
"`` well , i remember it ."
"i remember every detail clearly and i also remember that you were n't there in the morning ."
"you did n't want anything from me but a quick roll in the hay !"
"not even a congratulatory cup of coffee to see you off on your next adventure ! ''"
"she was so angry and hurt she could n't even rein in her temper a small bit to realize that she was hitting her mark right on target ."
"`` why did n't i tell you before now ?"
"well , perhaps we should look into that question more thoroughly !"
"oh !"
"wait a minute !"
"i could n't tell you that i 'd gotten pregnant that night because , '' she paused to take in a deep , hopefully calming breath , `` i did n't know who you really were until a few hours ago !"
"and what 's your other possible question ?"
"where have i been all these years ?"
"why could n't you find me after that one night ?"
"i realize that you were probably looking for another quick adventure in the sheets because i was such an easy conquest ."
"i have to apologize because for ten months after your little visit , i was pregnant with our son ! ''"
"she snapped at him ."
"she tried desperately hard to control her anger but it was very difficult with him standing here and her panic at max 's discovery looming like a threat in the air between them ."
"`` i had nowhere to go , and i had no job because my manager was presented with a picture of you and me in the park that night ."
"i knew that fraternizing with you violated hotel policy but i had no idea that you would be followed all over the city ."
"apparently a photographer recognized you and i was fired ."
"she closed her eyes and took another deep breath ."
"`` i had friends who helped me out ."
"i worked for them as a nanny while i was pregnant and she helped me after max 's birth ."
"it was n't easy , but i found a job several months after that and was able to work my way through school while still making sure that max had enough food ."
"i had to work at fast food restaurants , maid services , anyone who would pay me because i was fired for fraternizing with the hotel guests at my last job ."
"and do you have any idea how difficult it is to find another job when you 're a single , pregnant woman without an education ? ''"
"she paused for emphasis ."
"`` no !"
"you do n't know how hard it is because you 're a man !"
"and you have an education !"
"and you had all the perks and joys of being one of the wealthiest men in the world !"
"so do n't you dare come back at me and ask me why i did n't give you a head 's up about our son , '' she whispered as she almost punched him with her fury ."
"zayn knew that everything she was saying was true and it only fueled his guilt ."
"but it also gave him a purpose ."
"it relieved him of the stress of how to keep her in his life and gave him the perfect solution to his problem ."
"he 'd been pushing his team to find ella so he could make her his wife ."
"and for the past hour , he 'd been trying to figure out why she was so angry with him ."
"now he understood and the answer made his objective so much easier ."
"it was like a huge burden had just been lifted from his shoulders ."
"`` what 's so funny ! ''"
"she demanded , pulling back , astonished that he could find humor at anything said tonight ."
"his smile disappeared because nothing about this situation was humorous ."
"it was actually quite dangerous and he suddenly realized that he did n't have time right now to revel in his good fortune or the ecstatic reaction of his advisors when he told them that he already had an heir ."
"in fact , if things went the way he hoped they would go , he 'd have several heirs over the next few years !"
"he opened her apartment door and spoke rapidly in a language she suspected was arabic , but she was n't sure ."
"the bulky men that were standing in the hallway all snapped to attention , looking between her and zayn with a renewed sense of excitement and tension ."
"the men responded rapidly , one of them speaking into his watch ."
"several of the other men snapped to attention as well , nodding when their captain gave them instructions ."
"`` pack a bag , ella , '' zayn commanded when he closed the door behind him ."
"`` only the essentials ."
"one for you and one for max . ''"
"ella did n't understand what was going on , but it did n't look good ."
"`` why ?"
"we are n't going anywhere . ''"
"his hands were on his hips , his eyes looking down at her with triumph ."
"and heat !"
"`` yes ."
"you are definitely coming with me ."
"and we 're leaving in less than five minutes . ''"
"ella was shaking now , seeing him looking stern and commanding ."
"she 'd seen him being sweet and gentle , demanding and no-holds-barred sexy ."
"but this was new ."
"she did n't understand this man and he terrified her like none of the other versions ."
"she took a small step backwards , not sure how to handle zayn in this mode ."
"`` i 'm not going anywhere until you explain , zayn . ''"
"zayn stopped and looked down at her , understanding her fear ."
"he 'd felt it himself sixteen years ago when his father had shown up to claim him ."
"he could understand the resentment and confusion because he 'd felt it , experienced the deep-down panic of not understanding when people were making decisions for him ."
"unfortunately , he did n't have the luxury of time ."
"he needed to get her and max safe ."
"`` ella , that little boy sleeping in that room is my heir ."
"he is the prince of tusain ."
"i have to get both of you back to the hotel where you can be protected . ''"
"she was already shaking her head , not willing to listen to his terrifying statements any longer ."
"`` you 're wrong , zayn ."
"that 's my little boy and we 're not going anywhere but to school and work tomorrow . ''"
"zayn put a hand to her arm ."
"`` ella , i 'm sorry but this is n't your choice anymore . ''"
"ella did n't like those words ."
"of course there were choices ."
"there were always choices ."
"`` stop it ."
"stop it right now ! ''"
"she snapped at him , glancing nervously at the door to max 's room ."
"`` i wo n't have you scaring max like this ! ''"
"zayn almost chuckled because max was sound asleep ."
"it was ella who was scared , and rightly so ."
"`` you 're right ."
"forget about packing ."
"anything you need , it will be delivered to you ."
"grab your purse if you want it , '' he said and walked into max 's room ."
"`` we have to go , '' he said a few minutes later , max cradled in his arms ."
"ella froze , astonished by the picture of her tiny little son being carried in his father 's arms ."
"for the first time , she saw the two of them together and it was almost painful to see the resemblance now ."
"although max was still tiny compared to zayn , they had the exact same eyes , the same hair and even the same scowl even though max was sound asleep ."
"she might have laughed if it did n't feel like zayn was taking her son away from her ."
"`` why are you doing this ? ''"
"she cried , rushing towards the door and placing her body in front of it so he could n't leave ."
"seeing him with her son terrified her , panic welling up to almost choke her ."
"`` please do n't take him away from me , '' she sobbed , knowing there was nothing she could do if he tried to take her son ."
"he was bigger and stronger than she was ."
"and he had so many more resources than she could possibly imagine ."
"zayn realized where her thoughts were going and tried to reassure her ."
"`` ella , i 'm not taking max away ."
"i just need to protect him ."
"come with me , '' he said sternly and walked around her to the door , max bundled into a blanket ."
"he easily opened the door with one hand and both of them were quickly surrounded by large , bulky men in dark suits with scary looking bulges underneath their suit coats ."
"ella followed the two of them down the stairs , her mind reeling with everything that had happened ."
"she saw a clock and realized that only an hour had passed since zayn had walked into her apartment ."
"only sixty minutes and her whole world had changed ."
"what would the next twelve hours bring ?"
"she shuddered at the thought ."
"chapter 8 ella stretched , feeling warmer than usual ."
"the smell of fresh coffee was wafting through the air and the silence was blissful ."
"where was all the traffic ?"
"where were the lumps on the sofa ?"
"and who was making coffee ?"
"something was wrong ."
"no one made coffee unless she was dreaming ."
"and she definitely was n't dreaming ."
"was she ?"
"slowly she opened her eyes , hoping that the dream would continue ."
"she wanted so desperately to simply snuggle down into the warmth and not come up for several hours ."
"sleep was just so precious these days ."
"why was n't max jumping on the cushions next to her ?"
"why was n't he asking her for cereal or for something to eat ?"
"she should get up and make sure he was eating something healthy ."
"`` if you do n't stop that , '' zayn said with a groan , `` we 're going to start on max 's sister right now . ''"
"his words woke her up fully and she shifted away from the comfortable heat that had been holding her close ."
"ella sat up in bed , scrambling away while trying to cover herself with the sheet ."
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"she asked , panic welling up inside of her ."
"zayn chuckled and rolled over onto his back , yawning even while stuffing a pillow behind him to watch her ."
"`` we were married last night ."
"you 're in my bed . ''"
"ella put a hand to her forehead , her mind frantically trying to capture everything that had happened ."
"it slowly started coming back to her , but it was fuzzy ."
"she 'd been so tired ."
"zayn had carried max back to the hotel but all three of them had been hurriedly swept here to the penthouse ."
"she 'd been in here before , of course , but never as a guest ."
"the details of the previous night were coming back to her and she shuddered at the memories ."
"standing next to zayn , a man in front of them reciting the wedding ceremony words ."
"she 'd said `` i do '' but she 'd been confused , exhausted and scared ."
"`` that was n't a wedding , '' she grumbled , remembering the quick , efficient words spoken in the dim light as well as her worn out jeans and threadbare tee-shirt ."
"`` what would you call it ? ''"
"he asked , smiling slightly at her shyness at such an early hour of the morning ."
"although he suspected she might be shy anytime of the day ."
"until he kissed her ."
"or any kind of touch ."
"then she was n't shy ."
"at least she did n't used to be shy ."
"or that one night they 'd shared together , she had n't been shy ."
"ella cringed and looked around , pushing her hair out of her eyes while trying to figure out how to get out of this mess ."
"`` it was a three minute conversation between three strangers . ''"
"he laughed softly ."
"`` i guarantee that we are legally husband and wife . ''"
"his hand wanted to reach out and touch her back , to feel her softness and her heat ."
"but he knew she was confused ."
"bringing sex into the equation probably was n't the best idea ."
"unfortunately , having her curled up next to him all night had n't done much for his sleep ."
"she 'd been warm and soft and pressed all of that against him throughout the night ."
"well , what little had been left after the minister had finally left ."
"it had taken a few hours for his aide to organize the marriage license and a minister to arrive ."
"they 'd have to be wed once again when they returned to tusain , but in the eyes of the world , they were married ."
"an announcement had even been sent out to all the wire services so by this point , the world also knew that they were married ."
"in fact , they also knew that he had a son ."
"the details had been left out , but all of his enemies now knew that he had an heir ."
"he gritted his teeth with the anger that welled up inside of him at the idea of anyone hurting that little boy ."
"he was actually astounded that he 'd only known about max for less than twelve hours and already he was so protective of the little guy ."
"`` tell me about max , '' he said softly , but with an urgency that spoke volumes ."
"ella bit her lip , worried about where max was and what he might be thinking ."
"`` is he okay ?"
"where did you put him ? ''"
"`` he 's probably already awake and driving my guards crazy by now ."
"at least he will be if he is anything like i was . ''"
"ella 's eyes widened ."
"`` he would n't dare be impolite . ''"
"`` ah , ella , '' he chuckled ."
"`` i was never impolite ."
"i knew better than to do anything obviously wrong ."
"i learned early on that the trick to earning peoples ' trust was to at least appear innocent . ''"
"she swallowed painfully , because max had learned that lesson quickly as well ."
"`` where is he ?"
"can i check on him ? ''"
"zayn looked at her worried , green eyes and gave in ."
"he could n't hold out against ella 's plea , seeing her anxiety over their son written plainly on her beautiful features ."
"`` of course , ella ."
"he 's in the next room . ''"
"ella looked around , her eyes surveying the room and saw her tee shirt and jeans on the chair over by the window ."
"that meant ... she peeked under the sheet and knew she was blushing painfully when she realized that she was only wearing her bra and underwear ."
"`` would you mind turning around ? ''"
"he smiled and shook his head ."
"`` very much so . ''"
"she glared at him , irritated that he would be so ungentlemanly ."
"`` you 're a perfectly horrid man , '' she snapped ."
"she pulled the small blanket from the bottom of the bed and wrapped it around herself before walking with as much dignity as possible across the room ."
"`` i ca n't tell you how many times i 've cursed this blanket over the years ."
"and now it 's my saving grace . ''"
"zayn chuckled softly as he watched her walk into the bathroom , the blanket barely covering the essentials ."
"he did n't mind though ."
"he thought she was cute ."
"besides , he 'd see everything very soon ."
"`` we 're married , ella ."
"i 'll know that luscious body of yours so intimately that you soon wo n't have a qualm about walking around completely naked . ''"
"`` do n't count on it , '' she came back angrily before stomping into the bathroom ."
"`` oh , i definitely am , '' he replied , even though she could n't hear him ."
"ella turned on the warm water , amazed at how wonderful it felt ."
"she did n't luxuriate in the bathroom long though , not sure how much privacy he was going to give her ."
"she wished she had some clean clothes to put on , but zayn had rushed her out of the apartment so quickly the previous night , she had n't had time to grab anything except for the essentials for max ."
"and even he had only a single change of clothes ."
"when she emerged , her hair up in a towel but fully clothed once again , she felt much better ."
"zayn was coming out of another door and he looked as if he 'd showered as well ."
"he also looked amazingly virile in a perfectly tailored , dark suit ."
"she actually resented him for looking so cool and sophisticated while she was wearing yesterday 's casual clothes , feeling dingy and worn out ."
"`` where 's max ? ''"
"she snapped , unable to hide her irritation and vulnerability ."
"one eyebrow went up as he looked down at her eyes ."
"he saw the fear and the confusion along with several other fleeting emotions ."
"`` he 's fine ."
"let 's go have breakfast with him and you can introduce us . ''"
"she bit her lip , feeling guilty for not telling zayn about him before this ."
"but how could she ?"
"she 'd had no idea where zayn had gone , what he did for a living or even the slightest clue as to how to find him ."
"even if he 'd told her that he was ruler of tusain , she probably would n't have believed him ."
"seeing is believing though ."
"`` he 's a great kid , '' she said before preceding him out of the bedroom ."
"ella walked into the second bedroom and saw max still curled up , sound asleep on the bed ."
"she smiled down at him but even as she watched , he must have known something was happening ."
"his tiny body stretched in the massive bed and his little fists rubbed his eyes ."
"`` momma ? ''"
"he called out , just like he normally did ."
"`` i 'm here , honey , '' she said , moving quickly over to the side of his bed ."
"`` did you sleep well ? ''"
"max gave her a sleepy little smile then held is arms out for her morning hug ."
"`` i did ."
"i had weird dreams though . ''"
"ella laughed and hugged his long , skinny body ."
"`` i bet you did ."
"and things are going to get even more bizarre once you wake up fully . ''"
"max climbed onto her lap , his eyes just starting to focus enough to look around ."
"`` where are we ? ''"
"he asked , realizing for the first time that he was n't in his room any longer ."
"`` and who is that man over there ? ''"
"ella realized that max and zayn were staring at each other , their dark eyes looking so similar it ached to see them like this ."
"`` well , '' ella said softly , standing up and letting max climb on her back ."
"he might be only five years old , but he was extremely large for his age and carrying him piggy back was easier than on her hip ."
"the kid was pretty huge for his age !"
"go figure , considering his father , she thought with a deeper appreciation for genetics ."
"`` remember last year when you asked about your father and i told you stories about him when he was a kid ? ''"
"zayn 's eyes snapped to hers , then quickly back to max 's face once again ."
"max did n't even nod his head , too fascinated with zayn ."
"ella smiled ."
"`` well , yesterday we ran into each other ."
"your father is staying at the hotel where i work ."
"and yesterday , he came by to see you ."
"he was very excited to finally find you ."
"he 's been looking for you for years ."
"it 's such an odd coincidence that he was a guest at the very same hotel i worked in . ''"
"`` just like when you met him the first time ! ''"
"max whispered , excited as he wrapped his arms around her neck so ella could carry him forward ."
"she stopped when she was a foot away from zayn , letting both of the males survey each other ."
"max was more prepared since ella had told max stories about his father over the years ."
"so max was n't intimidated by zayn at all ."
"in fact , as max stuck his hand out for zayn to shake , ella realized that there was more than a little hero worship going on ."
"ella watched the two males carefully , ready to swoop in and protect her son if he started to get scared ."
"but she realized that her son was made of pretty stern stuff ."
"he was n't easily intimidated ."
"`` max , would you like to have breakfast with your dad ?"
"maybe you could ask him some questions about where he lives and what he likes to do now ? ''"
"`` that would be awesome , '' max said , trying to sound mature since he 'd heard the kids in the older grades using that phrase ."
"coming from his relatively tiny body , it sounded funny to her ears ."
"`` well , let 's go then , '' she said and carried him out of the room , superman pajamas and all ."
"as they walked , ella turned her head slightly so that she could speak with max ."
"`` deal is though , you have to answer some of his questions too ."
"i think your dad might want to get to know you just as much as you want to get to know him . ''"
"max grinned , eager to get to know this extremely large male who was following them ."
"`` you 're big , '' he said with excitement , eyeing the man walking next to him ."
"`` how tall are you ? ''"
"`` i 'm six feet , three inches tall ."
"how tall are you ? ''"
"zayn asked back ."
"max stretched his body out as far as it would go without losing balance on his mother 's back ."
"`` i do n't know ."
"momma says i grow like a worm , whatever that means . ''"
"she rolled her eyes , but since max was on her back and zayn was following behind her , neither of them saw ."
"she went directly to the beautifully polished table in the main area of the penthouse where a full breakfast was already laid out ."
"there were two maids that were finishing up with the table , both of whom smiled at ella since they 'd been friends for the past several years ."
"`` thanks , jane ."
"thanks marie , '' she said to both women who quickly left through the butler 's pantry ."
"ella sighed heavily , realizing that things were definitely going to change ."
"she had no idea how , or how much , but she wanted her friends back ."
"jane and marie were good people and she 'd babysat their kids for each of them ."
"there was a support system that she would miss if she had to leave here ."
"she did n't want to leave , she realized ."
"no matter how much money zayn might have , nothing would ever be like it was ."
"or maybe she was being too harsh on her judgment of what was to come ?"
"maybe things would n't change too drastically ."
"perhaps zayn would simply head back to his country and let her carry on raising max herself ."
"other fathers did that , not wanting the responsibility of raising their children ."
"she knew that was n't going to happen the moment zayn lifted max off of her back and sat him down in one of the elegant chairs ."
"zayn signaled to someone off to the side and immediately , the butler stepped forward and poured coffee for him as well as a cup for ella before bowing back to the wall to await the next command ."
"she sipped her coffee and listened to the two of them ask questions of each other ."
"max was obviously enthralled with discovering his new father and zayn was equally entranced by the little man sitting next to him ."
"they asked questions , responded , laughed at some of the answers and nodded their heads sagely at some of the other responses ."
"ella watched the whole thing , her heart breaking at the new reality that she would have to share her precious son now ."
"no matter how hard it had been over the past six years , she still cherished every moment with max ."
"well , not every moment ."
"she would have loved to share some of those late night ear infections , she thought as she sipped her coffee ."
"or maybe the first time he 'd fallen and scraped his knee ."
"yes , it would have been really nice to share that horror with zayn ."
"she 'd tuned out slightly , thinking back on all the fun or scary moments in her young son 's life so she was n't paying as much attention to their conversation ."
"but something caught her attention and she re-focused ."
"ella sat up straighter in her seat though when she heard zayn explain to max that he was a royal prince ."
"`` he is not ! ''"
"she snapped at him , almost dropping her coffee cup as the anger welled up inside of her ."
"max looked at his mother , not understanding the significance of being a prince but he fully comprehended her tone of voice ."
"max glanced at his new-found father , laying a protective hand on his arm as if he could ward off his mother 's anger somehow ."
"zayn looked calmly right back at her ."
"`` i 'm sheik zayn tiefel sarkis ."
"which means that my son , max , will be the next ruler of tusain ."
"that makes him prince max . ''"
"she almost stood up , shaking her head ."
"`` he 's a little boy who likes to plow his toy trucks into the buildings he 's made with blocks or pillows ."
"he 's not ready to be a prince . ''"
"zayn did n't say anything , but simply looked over at his aide who was standing to the side ."
"the man instantly snapped his fingers and a woman came forward ."
"`` i 'm debra miller , your highness , '' she said to ella , curtsying slightly and bowing her head ."
"`` i 've been hired as prince max 's nanny for however long you remain in the city ."
"would you like me to take him for his bath ? ''"
"ella did n't understand what was going on ."
"`` a nanny ? ''"
"she asked , almost choking on the words ."
"she turned back to zayn ."
"`` max does n't need a nanny ."
"he has me . ''"
"and why would this woman address her as `` your highness '' ?"
"zayn turned back to max , winking slightly and it even irritated ella that they 'd formed such an immediate bond ."
"`` how about if you go back into your room and play with ms. miller ?"
"i believe she came early this morning with lots of toys for you ."
"want to check them out ? ''"
"max 's eyes lit up at the idea of new toys ."
"`` oh boy , '' he said and quickly climbed down from his chair ."
"he was halfway across the room before he skidded to a halt and turned back to his mother ."
"`` is that okay ? ''"
"he asked , hope and excitement making his body wiggle ."
"ella did n't know what to say ."
"she glanced back at zayn , then at her son , worried at how rapidly things were changing ."
"`` that 's fine for now ."
"but do n't take him out of the penthouse , okay ? ''"
"`` of course , your highness , '' debra miller replied , curtsying once again before she followed after a hooping little boy , smiling ."
"ella turned away from zayn , not wanting him to see the tears that were quickly forming in her eyes ."
"`` what 's your intention ? ''"
"she finally demanded ."
"if zayn even hinted that he would take max away from her , he would have a fight on his hands !"
"zayn could see the stress in her eyes and he wanted to somehow reassure her that she was n't losing her son to the nanny ."
"`` ella , ms. miller came highly recommended . ''"
"ella almost jumped when she felt his hands on her shoulders ."
"wrenching herself free from his touch , she turned to face him , angrily wiping the tears from her eyes ."
"`` do n't touch me ! ''"
"she almost yelled ."
"she then realized that they were n't alone and looked at the others self-consciously ."
"`` i apologize , '' she said to the others in the room ."
"`` that was impolite . ''"
"zayn almost rolled his eyes ."
"not only did max need to learn to rule , but ella would need to be trained not to be subservient in front of the servants ."
"she had a great deal to learn as well ."
"`` would you all excuse us , please ? ''"
"zayn said to the room in general ."
"ella was astonished at how many people were actually in the room ."
"there were guards she had n't even detected because they were so quiet and still , not to mention the maids and the butler who was supervising breakfast , his personal assistant and one other man but she had no idea what his job was ."
"when they were finally alone , she turned to face him , pleading with her eyes for him to help her through all of this ."
"`` zayn , what is happening here ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"he moved forward , ignoring her flinch when he touched her cheek ."
"`` what 's happening is that you and max will come back to tusain with me ."
"max will learn to be ruler of tusain and you will be my wife . ''"
"`` no ! ''"
"she cried out ."
"she was n't sure which part she objected to the most ."
"`` we 're not leaving ."
"and max is too little to be burdened with the task of ruling anything other than his toy trucks . ''"
"he took her hands in his , not letting her pull away ."
"`` it has to be like this , ella ."
"and i know how you feel ."
"believe me . '"
"`` no you do n't ! ''"
"she yelled back ."
"`` you know nothing about what this is doing to me !"
"you left me !"
"twice , you just disappeared ."
"now you 're coming back and all of a sudden my life is out of control ."
"max does n't need this ."
"he needs to go to school , i need to go to work and you need to just leave us alone . ''"
"zayn wished that were possible ."
"`` ella , you 're my wife now ."
"max is my son . ''"
"she shook her head , denying all of it ."
"`` what if i told you that max is n't yours ? ''"
"she asked , wondering if she could convince zayn to just leave them alone ."
"`` maybe max is someone else 's son . ''"
"zayn 's anger almost got the better of him but he did n't verbally lash out as he wanted to ."
"he hated the idea of anyone else touching this woman ."
"she was his and he would prove it to her once and for all ."
"with great care , he lowered his head , his lips covering her trembling ones with a barely leashed passion ."
"when she tried to pull away , he simply put his hands on her hips and pulled her closer , deepening the kiss , sliding his hands underneath her tee-shirt and showing her how intense his need was for her ."
"when she was trembling in his arms , her fingers moving in his hair , zayn knew that this path was not a good plan ."
"her response made him lose his own concentration ."
"pulling back , he cursed under his breath for putting himself into this painful situation ."
"he did n't want to discuss the problem of their future ."
"he wanted to make love to her ."
"he wanted to have her writhing underneath him , begging him to take her to the heights of pleasure ."
"he looked around , wishing they were already back in tusain ."
"he could show her his private suite , rooms which would also become her own , and make love to her on satin sheets , or under the stars on his private balcony ."
"`` zayn , '' she sighed , leaning her forehead against his chest ."
"`` how can you do this to me so easily ? ''"
"she whispered as if she were really asking herself that question ."
"`` this was bad timing , '' he said and stepped back ."
"taking her hand , he led her over to one of the sofas ."
"`` you did n't eat anything for breakfast ."
"are you hungry ? ''"
"she bowed her head , ashamed that he could do that to her with so little effort and he appeared to be completely unaffected by their kiss ."
"`` no ."
"not at all . ''"
"she scooted far back , not wanting another occurrence of his kiss ."
"`` look , this is crazy ."
"max is just a little boy , '' she said with as much control as possible ."
"`` i know you want him in your life , but perhaps ... '' `` i know what you 're going to say , ella , '' zayn interrupted her ."
"`` but i ca n't just walk away ."
"would you ?"
"could you actually leave your son , leave max , and only have weekend visits occasionally ? ''"
"she sighed , accepting that he was right ."
"`` no ."
"i could n't do that ."
"and i 'm very sorry for even suggesting that you do the same . ''"
"she looked up at him , pleading with him for sanity ."
"`` so what 's going to happen ? ''"
"he took her hand and pulled her down so they were sitting next to each other ."
"`` we fly back to tusain today ."
"he 'll have special tutors , classes that will teach him how to rule and he will be raised as my heir . ''"
"she swallowed painfully ."
"`` and what role will i have in all of this ?"
"do i have a say in how he is raised ?"
"or have i lost all my rights now ? ''"
"the realization that she was even thinking in that way frustrated him ."
"he wanted her to be happy about this occurrence ."
"this was a good thing for everyone if she could just release her anxiety and look at the situation logically ."
"`` of course you have n't , '' he said and pulled her closer , sighing when he realized that she was trembling so violently ."
"`` you 're my wife ."
"i know you do n't realize it now , but you 're a very powerful woman . ''"
"she snorted , completely disbelieving his words ."
"he shrugged his shoulder ."
"`` you do n't understand now , but you will ."
"as my wife , you have powers you ca n't even imagine . ''"
"`` what kind of power ? ''"
"she asked , pulling her hand out of his and standing up ."
"she did n't like being next to him , feeling his strong thigh against hers ."
"it shocked her imagination , giving her ideas she did n't want to have ."
"he leaned back against the sofa , stretching his arms out wide ."
"`` well , it gives you the right to me . ''"
"she crossed her arms over her chest ."
"`` i do n't want rights over you . ''"
"he chuckled when her cheeks turned that pretty shade of pink , proving her a liar ."
"`` why not ?"
"women have been clamoring , tricking , conniving and doing desperate things to be in your shoes . ''"
"ella resisted the urge to glance down at her drugstore brand shoes ."
"`` i just want my old life back . ''"
"he shook his head slowly ."
"`` that 's not possible . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"she huffed with irritation that everything seemed so black and white to him ."
"`` first of all , because i wo n't allow you to work in a menial job now ."
"you 're my wife , so serving others is a thing of the past . ''"
"`` it was a good enough job for me yesterday ."
"why not today ? ''"
"`` because today , you hold the title of queen ella ."
"there 's a significant difference in everything you do now . ''"
"ella gasped and shook her head ."
"`` i 'm not ! ''"
"he smiled slightly ."
"`` you are . ''"
"she stumbled backwards and , in a flash , zayn was there , his arm wrapped around her waist , holding her steady ."
"holding her against him ."
"she plastered her hands against his chest , her mind getting all fuzzy again with his closeness ."
"`` do n't call me that ."
"and do n't touch me . ''"
"he chuckled softly ."
"`` anything you desire , your highness , '' he teased but he did n't release her ."
"`` except it 's going to be very hard to get you pregnant with our next child if i do n't touch you . ''"
"he bent his head and nibbled on her earlobe while his hands once again slipped underneath her tee-shirt ."
"she could n't believe he would suggest something so outrageous ."
"surely she had n't heard him correctly !"
"`` i 'm not going to get pregnant ! ''"
"she gasped ."
"her hands had wrapped around his wrists , initially in an attempt to pull his hands away , but he was too strong ."
"and as he shifted against her , his legs moving subtly between hers , those delicious shivers started up again ."
"`` do n't do that , '' she whispered , unaware that she was tilting her head so that he had better access to her neck ."
"`` why would i stop ? ''"
"he nibbled on her ear , her neck ."
"`` i want you . ''"
"`` no you do n't , '' she gasped , pulling back when the feelings became too much ."
"`` you disappeared ."
"twice . ''"
"he slid his hand up higher , his fingers resting just underneath her breasts ."
"`` i only disappeared once on my own ."
"the first time , my uncle found me and took me to tusain ."
"i did n't have a choice when i was eighteen ."
"now i choose you . ''"
"she grabbed his hands , afraid they might slip higher and she 'd be lost then ."
"`` zayn , you disappeared that last time ."
"the time when it counted ."
"i had no right to expect anything when you were eighteen ."
"i was a little girl , still in elementary school ."
"but you still disappeared then without a word ."
"i worried about you for a long time , especially when no one could find out anything about where you 'd gone ."
"but the second time , i had a right to not be abandoned . ''"
"she looked up at him , trying to convey the hurt she 'd felt when she woke up after their one night together and he 'd already left ."
"`` i did n't hear from you for a long time . ''"
"`` would you believe that i 've been searching for you for the past six years ?"
"you 're a very hard woman to find . ''"
"`` no , '' she shook her head ."
"`` i do n't believe you tried very hard ."
"i was right here ."
"raising our son . ''"
"he smiled slightly , still amazed that he had a son ."
"`` he 's real , is n't he ? ''"
"he asked , his eyes moving towards the doorway through which he 'd gone to play ."
"`` what was it like when he was born ?"
"do you have pictures ? ''"
"she tried to step out of his arms , but he was n't allowing that yet ."
"`` zayn , give me some space ."
"you 're a bit ... overwhelming . ''"
"he chuckled at her description ."
"`` see ?"
"even you ca n't deny that we are good together . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` knowing that and not wanting to trust you are two completely different issues . ''"
"he let her go , knowing that she had a point ."
"`` well , we 've made progress anyway . ''"
"she blinked up at him , wondering what she could have revealed ."
"what progress ?"
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"`` you at least acknowledge that you want me . ''"
"`` i did n't ! ''"
"she gasped ."
"`` you did , '' he laughed softly at her outrage ."
"`` you just said that you know that we 're good together ."
"no , '' he raised a hand to stop her arguments ."
"`` if you try to deny it again , i 'll just have to prove you wrong again . ''"
"he looked down at her beautiful features , astonished that she was lovely even without makeup ."
"she looked fresh and alive , more alluring somehow ."
"`` i know i 'll enjoy the process . ''"
"she twisted out of his arms , accepting that the only reason she was free of his touch was because he allowed it ."
"`` zayn , let 's get some ground rules set up here ."
"i do n't really understand what 's going on , but i do understand that you 're not trustworthy ."
"i trusted you once and you disappeared ."
"i was thrilled that you were okay , amazed even , six years ago ."
"and you just left after you got what you wanted . ''"
"`` we both got what we wanted . ''"
"she blushed at the memory of how voracious she had been in his arms that night ."
"`` i 'll concede that point ."
"but that does n't mean i 'm going to jump into bed with you ."
"you have your heir ."
"if you need ... female companionship ... '' she said the words uncomfortably , aware of the pain ripping through her at the idea of another woman in his arms , `` then go find it . ''"
"zayn controlled his temper , wondering how she could say something like that ."
"he could tell by the hurt look in her eyes that she did n't mean it ."
"but he acknowledged that he had a great deal of hurt to heal ."
"she 'd trusted him six years ago and he 'd unintentionally betrayed that trust ."
"even before that , he 'd disappeared sixteen years ago and had n't explained even when he saw her again ."
"yes , there was a great deal of trust that needed to be fixed ."
"he did n't move closer to her , but he stepped in front of her , his hands on his hips as he tried to control his temper ."
"he never had problems with anger but ella ignited emotions in him he had n't known he possessed ."
"`` ella , you 're my wife now ."
"and you will learn to trust me again ."
"i 'll make sure of it . ''"
"he saw his assistant out of the corner of his eye and nodded slightly , running a hand through his hair with the increasing frustration over his responsibilities ."
"he did n't want to face them now ."
"he was actually torn between the options of tossing this woman over his shoulder and making love to her and the equally appealing idea of getting to know his son ."
"unfortunately , neither was a possibility at this point ."
"`` we have to get going , '' he said curtly ."
"`` and you need to get dressed . ''"
"ella looked down at her jeans and tee-shirt , confused ."
"`` i am dressed ."
"what 's wrong with my clothes ? ''"
"he sighed , wishing he did n't have to do this but it had to be said ."
"`` i know this is going to be frustrating to you , but just about every reporter in the world is going to try and take your picture as soon as we step outside of this hotel ."
"possibly even outside the suite ."
"we need to release a photo of you to the press , but they 'll want to see you before that can be arranged . ''"
"he braced himself for the next words , not wanting to hurt her or anger her , but she needed to hear the truth ."
"`` and you ca n't be seen in jeans ."
"ever . ''"
"she shrunk back slightly , not completely sure what he was saying ."
"`` why ca n't i wear jeans ? ''"
"`` you can wear them , you just ca n't wear them outside of our private suite . ''"
"she swallowed , shaking her head ."
"`` zayn , i love wearing jeans . ''"
"he smiled slightly ."
"`` and i love seeing you in them . ''"
"he almost laughed at her blush and her hands immediately went to her bottom ."
"she knew exactly what he was looking at in her jeans ."
"`` but you represent me and tusain now ."
"you represent all of the people of tusain and they are good , decent people who work hard and take pride in their efforts ."
"you ca n't shame them by wearing jeans . ''"
"he could tell that her stubbornness was almost choking her ."
"`` i 've had one of my assistants get you some new clothes ."
"they are already in the bedroom we shared last night . ''"
"she glared at him ."
"`` and if i do n't want to wear those clothes ? ''"
"she asked , not sure why she was fighting the idea of pretty new clothes ."
"she 'd love to wear something more feminine and only wore jeans because they were comfortable and convenient ."
"and cheap , she reminded herself ."
"the jeans she was wearing now had cost her only twelve dollars ."
"zayn eyed her carefully ."
"he understood suddenly that he needed to take a different approach to gain her cooperation ."
"he relaxed and shrugged his shoulders ."
"`` you 're right ."
"you do n't need to change into anything ."
"i 'll just make sure that i 'm behind you whenever we 're walking ."
"i 'll definitely enjoy the view . ''"
"he almost laughed out loud at her horrified expression but he restrained himself admirably ."
"`` where 's the stupid suit ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"zayn only pointed in the direction of the bedroom they 'd shared last night and watched her with interest as she walked away ."
"`` you 've won !"
"stop staring at me ! ''"
"she called out , not even bothering to look back at him to make sure he was looking ."
"he was , and he was enjoying both her anger and her adorable bottom ."
"his amusement could n't be contained any longer ."
"at her admonishment , he threw back his head and laughed , admiring both her sexy figure in the jeans as well as her spunk ."
"he would definitely enjoy that temper of hers , he thought as she stomped into the bedroom and closed the door ."
"zayn went through the immediate problems his assistants brought to him but when ella emerged from the bedroom , wearing a stunning blue suit with matching blue heels , he could barely speak ."
"she was beautiful , he thought ."
"every time he saw her , each different nuance of her personality created a new spark of interest ."
"the sparks were becoming a fire that he was barely able to control ."
"especially when she looked so lovely ."
"he wondered if his assistant had gotten her new lingerie as well ."
"or was she still wearing those cotton briefs and the white cotton bra ?"
"he felt his body harden at either possibility ."
"damn , why had he left her alone last night ?"
"she 'd been so soft and warm and he knew he could have gotten her to respond ."
"maybe he would n't be in so much pain just watching her walk towards him now ."
"but she 'd needed her sleep last night ."
"he 'd thrown a lot at her in only a few hours and he knew she 'd been exhausted ."
"tonight though ."
"there would be no turning back tonight ."
"he 'd have her in his home , in his private rooms and he would make sure that the only thing she had to wear was some silky thing that would easily slip off of her luscious curves which he would then explore with careful attention to detail ."
"he shook his head slightly , knowing that it would be very obvious what he was thinking very soon if he did n't switch gears ."
"`` are you ready ? ''"
"he asked ."
"ella heard the huskiness in his voice and wondered about it ."
"glancing up , she saw the heat in his eyes and almost stepped back , overwhelmed and intimidated by zayn when he looked like this ."
"gone was the ruler and the father of her child ."
"this was just the man ."
"the one who made her tremble with just a touch , who could make her scream out with his fingers ."
"and his mouth ."
"and other parts of his body ."
"she closed her eyes and looked away , breaking the intimate , visual contact ."
"`` ready for what ? ''"
"she asked , looking at the sofa ."
"`` and where is max ? ''"
"`` i 'm right here , momma ! ''"
"max 's eager voice called out to her as he ran through the room , barreling towards her so he could throw himself into her arms ."
"`` you look awesome ! ''"
"he said as he looked up at her , his strong arms clinging to her leg ."
"ella bent down and gave him a hug ."
"`` goodness , you look wonderful , yourself ! ''"
"she pulled back and looked at him ."
"his hair had been combed and he was wearing a pair of khaki pants with a shirt actually tucked in !"
"she could n't ever get him to tuck in his shirt but it had n't been a huge issue since he normally wore jeans and a tee-shirt ."
"`` who combed your hair ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"that had been one battle she had n't had the ability to combat ."
"she kept his hair cut short so it was n't too much of a problem , but when it went too long in between cuts , it got more than a little ruffled ."
"`` ms. miller said that a handsome prince needs his hair to look neat ."
"so i let her do it . ''"
"he looked at her with a slight roll of his eyes ."
"`` she 's a lot of fun , momma . ''"
"ella tamped down on the jealousy and hurt she felt when max described the other woman ."
"he loved his school teachers as well and she was n't jealous of those women ."
"why should she feel threatened by the amazingly efficient ms. miller ?"
"`` well , you look very handsome , '' ella said to max who puffed up proudly ."
"zayn looked at the two of them , suddenly overwhelmed with emotion at the sight of his family ."
"his son was the spitting image of himself and it infuriated him to think of ella trying to convince him that max was n't his son ."
"backing off of that anger , he knew that she 'd done it only to protect both herself and their son ."
"she was a good mother , he realized ."
"`` we need to move , '' he said ."
"he picked max up into his arms , looking at him now at eye level ."
"`` are you ready ? ''"
"he asked the little boy ."
"max grinned and nodded his head ."
"`` ready ! ''"
"he came right back , eager for whatever next adventure was on the horizon ."
"ella swallowed painfully , seeing the two of them bonding like that ."
"she loved her son , but was she ready to share him ?"
"as the entourage surrounded zayn and her son , she realized that she did n't have much of a choice ."
"zayn 's guards , which seemed to have doubled overnight , were surrounding all of them , several talking into their wrists and there were even more in the hallway when they left the penthouse and descended into the parking garage ."
"the three of them were ushered into a waiting limousine and ella could n't believe how much fuss was being made to get them out of the hotel ."
"then the limousine pulled away from the garage and ella was shocked to see a crowd of photographers and reporters crowded around the entrance of the hotel ."
"there were also three more limousines waiting by the door ."
"when their limousine drove past , one of the photographers caught sight of their departure and actually started running down the street ."
"ella watched from the rear window as he frantically snapped pictures of their departing vehicle while running across the traffic on pennsylvania avenue ."
"that street was several lanes wide with traffic circles , strange crossing lanes , bike lanes and a large number of pedestrians ."
"the street was lined with several national treasures so there were tourists everywhere mingling in with the government workers making their way to their various office buildings ."
"but as the police escort screamed with their sirens blaring , everyone stopped to look , trying to determine who was in the caravan of limousines and black suvs as they drove through the traffic with ease since the police were blocking traffic to keep the caravan moving ."
"it took an astonishingly short period of time to get to the airport , helped along by the police escort ."
"but nothing could have prepared ella for the frantic day ."
"the flight was quiet since she and max sat in one of the leather chairs in a private area of the plane ."
"they ate their meals alone and , when ella asked where zayn was , she was told he was in meetings for the duration of the flight ."
"when they landed , there was another rush through the airport but everything was stream-lined once again ."
"there were no immigration lines , no forms to fill out ."
"when one was the head of the country , ella guessed that the normal governmental forms were n't really required ."
"she was finally shown to a large , beautiful suite of rooms where there was a large bedroom , a gorgeous sitting room , even a lovely conservatory filled with strange and exotic plants ."
"she and max explored everything , loving the balcony that looked out over the city ."
"but by that point , it was late and she had n't slept well the previous night ."
"she tucked max into his new bed , smiling at how excited the little guy was ."
"`` we 're going to be okay , right momma ? ''"
"he asked as he yawned , fighting to keep his eyes open despite the late hour and the extremely long , exciting day ."
"she tucked the blanket around his small shoulders and gave him a kiss on his nose ."
"`` yes ."
"we 're going to be okay ."
"go to sleep , '' she said softly ."
"she tucked him in and walked out , closing the door before moving into the beautiful bedroom ."
"she was almost completely undressed , reaching for one of the silky robes she 'd found in the closet when she heard a noise behind her ."
"spinning around , she found zayn walking towards her , his hands efficiently stripping off his suit and his eyes filled with heat ."
"`` what are you doing in here ? ''"
"she demanded , pulling the robe over herself as quickly as her nervous fingers would allow ."
"he smiled slightly but she could see the fatigue in his eyes ."
"`` this is where i sleep . ''"
"ella blinked and looked around ."
"`` here ? ''"
"he laughed slightly , but more because he was still enchanted with her blushes ."
"`` yes ."
"is that going to be a problem ? ''"
"she was n't sure exactly what to say ."
"`` i thought this was where i slept . ''"
"suddenly , the amazing quarters made sense ."
"`` this is your private suite , is n't it ?"
"this is where you live . ''"
"he approached her slowly , his eyes never leaving her face but his fingers worked the buttons on his shirt , slowly revealing the tanned skin underneath ."
"`` you figured that out quickly . ''"
"she squared her shoulders , determined not to fall under his sensuous spell ."
"`` zayn , i 'm not sleeping in the same bed with you . ''"
"he chuckled and bent lower so he could see her eyes more clearly ."
"`` there are no other rooms to sleep in , ella . ''"
"she held her breath , trying very hard to be firm , but his muscular chest with the light , sprinkling of black hair across the top which narrowed down to an intriguing line , was getting in the way of her concentration ."
"`` zayn , this is ridiculous . ''"
"he took her hand and tried to place it on his chest but she curled her fingers up into a fist , refusing to touch him ."
"she knew if she did that , she would be gone ."
"`` zayn , please do n't do this , '' she whispered ."
"`` do n't make love to my wife ? ''"
"he asked softly , his hand reaching up so that his fingers could slide through her long , dark hair ."
"`` i think that is a very good idea ."
"i do n't know why you are resisting . ''"
"she stepped back , desperate now ."
"`` because i do n't trust you ."
"i do n't know what happened six years ago ."
"i do n't really understand what happened ten years ago ."
"all i understand is that we have a son together and i 'm in a foreign country ."
"the rest of ... everything , '' she stammered , overwhelmed by all the issues she did n't understand , `` is a complete mystery ."
"and yet you want me to simply trust you and jump into bed with you as if everything were great . ''"
"zayn sighed and pulled his hand away ."
"she had a point ."
"`` okay , so what do you want to happen ? ''"
"she considered her options , surprised that he was being so accommodating given the current situation ."
"`` i 'd like to understand what 's going on ."
"i 'd like to get to know you without the pressure of sex between us ."
"i want to learn to trust you and know that you wo n't just disappear on me again . ''"
"he laughed at that last one ."
"`` ella , i 'm in charge of the whole country ."
"i 'm not going anywhere . ''"
"she bit her lip , truly frightened of the power he wielded here ."
"`` okay , then i need to trust that you wo n't send me away and keep max to yourself . ''"
"he reared back slightly , astonished that she could be thinking anything along those lines ."
"`` i 'd never do that to you . ''"
"she crossed her arms over her chest , feeling painfully vulnerable ."
"`` never ?"
"there is an intense physical attraction between us , '' she started to say ."
"`` at least you acknowledge that , '' he interrupted , becoming angry that she could think so little of him ."
"she knew he was furious and it scared her ."
"`` zayn , even right now , i 'm afraid of speaking my mind to you ."
"i do n't know you , i do n't know what you 're capable of , and i especially do n't know your thoughts or what you think of me ."
"we had two dates the last time you were in washington , d.c. and one of those evenings was spent ... '' she blushed and had to look away ."
"`` well , you know where it was spent ."
"needless to say , not a lot of talking was done after dinner . ''"
"she cleared her throat and changed the subject , ignoring the sudden heat in his eyes ."
"`` before that , i knew you on the streets of our old neighborhood , but i did n't really know you as a person ."
"you walked me home from school when i was a kid and i know that we laughed and talked about lots of things ."
"but you were seventeen at the time , almost eighteen and i was barely eight years old ."
"the things we discussed were superficial at best ."
"and most of the time , you were just trying to tease me out of running someplace to hide because i was so wimpy back then . ''"
"his eyebrows came down low over his dark eyes ."
"`` you were n't wimpy , ella ."
"you were scared and did n't know how to stand up for yourself . ''"
"she took a deep breath , closing her eyes briefly ."
"`` and you taught me to do that ."
"so here i am . ''"
"she turned to fully face him , showing him that she was determined now ."
"`` i 'm standing up for myself and asking you not to push this relationship to a physical level until we know each other better . ''"
"he considered her request for a long moment , his body telling him to ignore her point and get her into bed ."
"he knew that they could get to know each other personally while still accepting this almost painful desire for each other ."
"but his mind was telling him that she might have a point ."
"not that they could n't get to know each other and still enjoy each other ."
"since it was going to happen anyway , why not just enjoy the entire process ?"
"unfortunately , he knew that pushing her in that way might slow down her trusting him ."
"and he suddenly wanted that very much ."
"she was strong and capable and had survived so much ."
"he did n't want to hurt her now that she was his wife ."
"`` how long do you think it might take for you to trust me ? ''"
"he asked , gritting his teeth as his body rebelled against not pulling her into his arms ."
"she could n't believe that he was accepting her request !"
"all the tension that had been building up inside of her over the past half hour suddenly went away and she felt as if she could breathe much more easily ."
"`` thank you , '' she sighed , a smile breaking out on her face ."
"`` but i do n't know how long it will take to get to know each other ."
"can we take it one day at a time ? ''"
"she asked with hope in her eyes ."
"zayn looked at her soft , dark hair and his body ached ."
"`` we can take it slowly ."
"but you 're staying here in this suite ."
"i wo n't touch you , but i 'll wait until you come to me ."
"is that fair ? ''"
"he asked ."
"ella thought about it for a long moment and then smiled brightly ."
"`` i think that 's more than fair , '' she sighed with relief ."
"`` i 'll even sleep on the couch and you can have the bed . ''"
"he eyed the sofa with distaste ."
"`` i 'll sleep on the sofa ."
"you take the bed . ''"
"she laughed and shook her head ."
"`` zayn , i 've been sleeping on the sofa for the past eleven years ."
"i truly do n't mind ."
"whereas you would n't even fit on the sofa because of your height ."
"i 'm much shorter and i 'm guessing this sofa will be enormously more comfortable than what i 'm used to , '' she said with happiness ."
"zayn was n't immune to her relief and her beautiful smile felt like a stab in his heart ."
"he could do this , he told himself firmly ."
"he could resist her delectable body for the amount of time it would take her to learn to trust him , to get to know him ."
"he 'd waited six years for her , he could wait a few more days ."
"chapter 9 ella jerked awake when she heard the door slam ."
"she was still half asleep but rolled over onto her back , staring up at the ceiling as she forced her mind to start working again ."
"something had to change , she told herself ."
"she could n't go on like this any longer ."
"sleeping on the couch was one thing ."
"she could handle that since she 'd done it ever since max was born but this cold silence between zayn and herself was getting to her ."
"every night he kissed her , made her so delirious with need that she could barely stand up ."
"but something inside of her simply could n't take that next step and give herself permission to make love with him ."
"she was hurt , she told herself ."
"she was wounded and trying to make him suffer just as much as she 'd been hurt when she 'd woken up that morning six years ago to find him gone ."
"not to mention her terror when she realized that she was pregnant , jobless and basically homeless at eighteen ."
"what a mess , she thought ."
"there was already a coffee service sitting in the room waiting for her , just as it was every morning ."
"but she did n't bother to take any of the morning brew that , theoretically , would jump start her body ."
"the first morning had been fine , the coffee hot and rich ."
"delicious ."
"she 'd savored one of the perks of her new role , something she had n't anticipated ."
"that first morning , she 'd relished the idea of someone fixing her coffee and delivering it to her room each morning ."
"but by the second morning , the coffee had n't been as warm ."
"and it had n't tasted very good either ."
"it was almost as if it had been purposely burned the previous day , put into the refrigerator and then mildly heated up the following morning for her ."
"in a word , it had been undrinkable ."
"she 'd dressed quickly that morning and searched out a cup of hot coffee , finding a cup in the offices where the administrators worked diligently on government business ."
"each morning , she 'd snuck into their domain to find her coffee , ignoring the service that was delivered every day by mysterious servants ."
"that was n't all that was a problem though ."
"she was losing weight because her breakfast and lunch meals were either too cold , too salty , too spicy or just nauseating ."
"the first few days , she 'd been in awe of the cook and all the creatively prepared and beautifully presented dishes ."
"but apparently word got around that she was still refusing to sleep with their ruler ."
"now the entire palace staff was fighting a silent battle with her , admonishing her in the only way they knew how ."
"by sabotaging her meals , her wardrobe , her coffee and other small things ."
"she knew it was on purpose because she dined with zayn and max every evening and the meals there were delicious and perfectly prepared ."
"there had even been one time when she 'd tried to sneak into the kitchens to find something to eat ."
"a cook had spotted her , stepping in front of her and asking her in a painfully polite way if he could fix her something to eat ."
"she could see from the banked hostility in his eyes that she would n't get anything on her own in the kitchens ."
"she 'd simply turned around and left the area , feeling like a naughty dog running away with its tail between its legs ."
"and she missed max ."
"it was selfish of her because she knew he was learning so much being here ."
"besides , he absolutely worshiped zayn and the feelings were returned ."
"every night , she 'd sit with max while he ate his dinner , hearing about all the wonderful things his tutors were teaching him ."
"he was learning math skills at an alarming rate , already telling her the theory behind trigonometry and calculus although his young mind could n't grasp the actual math formulas behind the theories ."
"he was also reading better than he ever had , but that was nothing new since the little guy had been reading to her since preschool , well ahead of his peers ."
"his handwriting was still atrocious , but he was using better words while he wrote as well as when he spoke and his spelling was improving by leaps and bounds ."
"outside of the school room , he was also learning to ride a horse , or more specifically , a pony that zayn had given him on his first day here ."
"the pony was the perfect size for him , small enough to control but big enough so he did n't feel patronized by the smaller horse ."
"ella had asked to be taught to ride , but when the instructor had brought out the meanest , nastiest horse , ella had backed away , terrified of the snorting beast that did n't look like it was even trained to carry a rider yet ."
"when the horrible beast tried to bite her hand when she 'd reached out to pet him , ella had pulled back in fear , thanked the instructor for his time and walked back into the palace ."
"the only reason she ventured into the stables now was to find the kittens she 'd discovered the first week and to pretend she was still taking riding lessons ."
"she brought the kittens treats and enjoyed their antics while they flounced around in the hay , tumbling over each other ."
"since she did n't want to admit to zayn that she was too afraid to learn to ride a horse , she pulled on her riding outfit every morning at the appointed time and walked out to the stables , only to find the kittens and sit down to play ."
"okay , so she admitted silently that her fascination with the kittens was more about hiding from the stable hands than anything else ."
"she knew she was being a coward but she did n't know enough about horses to stand up for herself , nor did she care to accept the assurances by the stable master that the horse he 'd brought to her would cooperate ."
"even her arabic tutor was in on the harassment ."
"the first few mornings , the woman had been wonderfully patient and ella had learned a great deal ."
"but the woman must have gotten wind of her resistance to sleeping with zayn and her patience disappeared ."
"their meetings came down to her rapidly saying something to ella , then waiting for ella to reply ."
"since ella had no idea what the woman had said , there were long pauses of silence where the two women stared at each other ."
"in the end , ella had simply walked out of the room , refusing to meet with the tutor again ."
"instead , she 'd gone to the massive library and found an arabic to english dictionary ."
"for hours each day , she worked diligently at learning the complicated language ."
"she would then practice with max during his afternoon tea time when the two of them had some time alone ."
"it was much more helpful to speak the language with him since he was picking it up quickly , his young mind like a sponge ."
"he was more advanced than she was , but he was patient with her and laughingly helped her with her pronunciation ."
"she should probably talk to zayn and ask him to intercede , but she could n't do it ."
"she had pride and the idea of going to him and asking him to demand the servants stop treating her so horribly just felt like she was being more of a coward ."
"instead , she stood up for herself when possible and ignored the servants at other times ."
"she 'd taken care of herself almost all her life so she did n't need their help to make it through the day ."
"having been a servant for years herself , she knew that she could n't force the staff to treat her properly ."
"since she could n't fire them , she had to earn their respect ."
"unfortunately , it seemed that the only way to earn their respect was to sleep with their ruler ."
"since that was out of the question , she was in a quandary as to what to do ."
"she was n't going to back down though ."
"she refused to be hurt again ."
"she had no reason to trust zayn so she stood her ground , refusing to be used this time ."
"they were talking , but he was so busy with his official duties that their conversations were generally cut short ."
"as long as she could see max each day , she could deal with all the rest ."
"well , almost all the rest , she thought as she sat in their private suite of rooms , waiting nervously for zayn to come to bed ."
"it was after eleven o'clock in the evening and they 'd left his guests , some dignitaries from great britain , who had dined with them ."
"she did n't have anything to wear except for long satin or silk nightgowns , all of them draping over her body sensuously ."
"she pulled the belt of the robe more tightly around her waist , bracing herself for zayn 's return ."
"this conversation would probably go more smoothly if she had something less sexy to wear ."
"but this was all she had available unless she wanted to don one of the formal suits or an evening gown ."
"she preferred to be ready for bed when zayn arrived though ."
"every night , he 'd come into the suite and start undressing ."
"she 'd tried to hide from him , but her eyes devoured him as soon as he started unbuttoning his shirt ."
"his hot eyes captured hers while he stripped himself ."
"initially , she 'd thought to already be under the covers she kept on the sofa , but he 'd nixed that plan easily the first when he 'd simply sat down beside her on the sofa , his shirt already dispensed with and he 'd kissed her ."
"every night , she was almost whimpering with need by the time she 'd found the strength to push him away , but it was getting harder and harder to remember why she was resisting him ."
"her mind might still be angry with him , but her body did n't care ."
"there were many moments she wanted him to ignore her resistance and just make love to her until they were both breathless ."
"she wanted him to take her to that huge bed and kiss her all over , just like he had that one night so long ago ."
"over the past six years , there had been so many nights when she 'd lain awake thinking of him , wondering what he was doing and where he 'd gone ."
"she 'd scrambled her brain trying to figure out what she 'd done wrong that night , what she 'd done to push him out her door so early in the morning ."
"tonight , she did n't want to go through the normal undressing and kissing process , so she did n't get ready for bed immediately after entering their suite ."
"she 'd unzipped her dress and hung it up carefully , then pulled the silk nightgown over her head and tied the matching robe around her waist tightly ."
"instead of sitting inside waiting for him , she curled up on one of the big , comfortable chairs out on the terrace ."
"she did n't want to watch him get undressed ."
"she did n't want to feel that need sweep over her , almost choke her with the intensity ."
"she wanted zayn , but she was afraid of that need ."
"afraid of being hurt again ."
"`` why are you out here ? ''"
"his deep voice asked from the darkness ."
"ella jumped , gripping the arms of the chair as she turned to look at him ."
"she was relieved to see that he still had his shirt on ."
"the ends of his tuxedo tie were hanging around his neck and the top few buttons of his shirt were undone , but she could handle that ."
"she quickly stood up and walked to the bannister , putting more space between the two of them ."
"`` dammit ! ''"
"she heard him say ."
"swinging around , she looked at him curiously ."
"shrinking back , she became terrified of the anger in his eyes ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"she whispered ."
"zayn advanced on her furiously ."
"`` are you doing this on purpose ? ''"
"he leaned over her , bracing his arms on the marble bannister behind her , forcing her to bend backwards ."
"`` doing what ? ''"
"she asked , her fingers moving to the edge of her robe , pulling it tighter ."
"`` wearing that silk gown ."
"not wearing any underwear ! ''"
"he growled , his hands coming up to grab her upper arms ."
"`` you 're driving me insane with need and you know it ! ''"
"she yanked her arms , trying desperately to break his hold but she only hurt her arms instead ."
"`` let me go !"
"i 'm not trying to do anything to you !"
"i only have these ridiculous things to sleep in at night and i do n't have any clean underwear ! ''"
"that stopped him cold ."
"`` what the hell do you mean ? ''"
"his grip slackened with his confusion and she was able to step out of his arms , putting several feet between them ."
"`` i mean , your wonderful staff , who mysteriously come and go , have n't seen the need to do any laundry for me lately . ''"
"`` they do laundry every day ! ''"
"he came back ."
"she was rubbing her arms , feeling sad and pathetic all of a sudden ."
"she was n't even aware that she was crying ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she countered , swinging back to him ."
"she could n't hold back any longer ."
"all the loneliness and pain almost chocked her ."
"`` they do your laundry every day ."
"they used to do my laundry but since i wo n't sleep with you , i do n't receive the same service ."
"nor do i get hot coffee , edible food , courteous instructions or even a polite smile every once in a while ."
"your staff hates me and i ca n't believe i 'm here telling you all of this !"
"because you 're just a big , evil brute who only wants a son ! ''"
"she turned away so he would n't see her tears , ashamed that she 'd resorted to such an unladylike outburst ."
"she 'd wanted to hold out , to not give in to the loneliness that was surrounding her every day ."
"but seeing him , wanting him like she did but so afraid of giving in to his pursuit , just crushed her resolve ."
"zayn moved closer , looking at her bowed head and his confusion increased ."
"`` what the hell are you talking about ?"
"i see the coffee service waiting for you every morning . ''"
"she took a deep breath , closing her eyes and trying to regain control of her temper ."
"`` you 're right ."
"i 'm being silly ."
"please excuse me , '' she said and tried to walk by him back into the suite ."
"she wiped the back of her hands on her cheeks , trying to dry her tears , but his arm reached out and grabbed her , pulling her back so she was facing him ."
"`` ella , explain what you meant . ''"
"`` let me go , '' she said softly , gritting her teeth to keep herself from breaking down again ."
"she 'd overcome worst obstacles in her life , she could get through this one as well ."
"`` not until you tell me why you 're crying . ''"
"he reached out and caught one of her tears before it fell , drying her cheek with the rough pad of his thumb ."
"ella could take anger and rude behavior ."
"she could take passive-aggressive staff members ."
"but his tenderness , after weeks of hostility and the constant battle to resist him broke through her defenses ."
"she could n't fight her need to touch him any longer so when he pulled her close , she let the tears flow , her body shaking as the sobs escaped her too-thin body ."
"his arms wrapped around her , his large hands caressing her back gently ."
"`` you 've lost too much weight , ella ."
"you have to eat something . ''"
"his words only made her cry harder , her anger and loneliness swamping her and her hands clenched his shirt while her tears dampened the pristine , white fabric ."
"she felt him lift her into his arms and he cradled her against him while he sat down in one of the chairs , holding her close while the tide of sadness enveloped her ."
"he rocked her back and forth , his strong arms holding her close while one of his hands moved down her body ."
"it took a long time , but eventually , her tears subsided and she just lay in his arms , spent and unable to move away from him ."
"not that she wanted to ."
"she was so desperate for human kindness , she 'd take anything ."
"even gentle caresses from a man she knew she should n't trust ."
"`` what 's going on , ella ? ''"
"he asked when her hiccups had subsided ."
"ella sighed , her body too exhausted to do anything more than just lean against him ."
"`` nothing , '' she replied , wanting to hide her face in his neck and breathe in deeply ."
"`` obviously something is wrong ."
"i do n't think i 've ever known you to be this sad ."
"even when betsy winkle stole your notebooks , then wrote all those nasty things about you and mike burns . ''"
"she laughed , wishing it did n't sound so much like a giggle ."
"`` betsy was evil , '' she replied , wiping her cheeks with the back of her hand ."
"`` so are you going to tell me why you are so sad ?"
"or are you going to make me find out on my own ? ''"
"she knew she should get up ."
"she should get out of his lap but it just felt so nice to be connected to someone ."
"it had been a long time since she 'd had someone to just laugh with , talk to ."
"`` i 'm better now . ''"
"zayn sighed , his arms tightening around her protectively ."
"`` you 're not better ."
"apparently i have an inefficient staff who ca n't provide underwear for you , '' he growled ."
"she giggled again , wishing it were n't so serious ."
"`` it is n't funny , ella ."
"i 've been watching that cute butt of yours for weeks as you walk down the hallway and now i find out you do n't have any underwear at all ."
"do you have any idea what that 's going to do to my concentration ? ''"
"she chuckled and shook her head ."
"`` try going a morning without coffee , '' she blurted out , then froze ."
"he shifted slightly so he could look down at her ."
"`` what the hell is in the coffee service if there 's no coffee ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"ella could actually feel his anger increasing while she laid there in his arms ."
"`` it 's okay , zayn ."
"it was hard at first but ... '' his eyes snapped together angrily ."
"`` at first ?"
"how long has this been going on ? ''"
"she sighed and pulled herself up in his lap ."
"ignoring the large hand that slipped down her satin nightgown to her bottom , she stood up and walked away ."
"leaning against the railing , she crossed her arms over her chest ."
"`` the servants are n't happy that i wo n't sleep with you , zayn . ''"
"`` neither am i , but i do n't sabotage your coffee , '' he growled and stood up ."
"pacing back and forth , he put his hands on his hips ."
"`` what else have they been doing besides not doing your laundry and not giving you coffee . ''"
"she smiled sadly ."
"`` let 's be clear , zayn ."
"someone provides coffee every morning ."
"it just is n't ... '' she searched for a good word , one that would n't fire up his temper even more ."
"`` it is n't very good coffee . ''"
"`` what 's that supposed to mean ? ''"
"he demanded , stopping in front of her and glaring down into her pretty green eyes that never failed to fascinate him ."
"she cringed and looked at him strangely ."
"`` i can handle this , '' she said , suddenly feeling much stronger than she had a half hour ago ."
"it was almost as if her bout of crying had released all the stress and allowed her to see through the confusion to a resolution ."
"`` what will you do ? ''"
"he asked gently , moving closer to her ."
"`` i 'm going to take care of it , '' she replied softly ."
"she did n't realize that her hand had moved up to his chest until she felt his muscles flex underneath her fingertips ."
"`` you 're going to let me handle this , '' he countered ."
"`` you 've been dragged halfway across the world , '' he said as his head dipped lower , `` i will make sure that my household treats you with the respect your title deserves . ''"
"she did n't have an argument for that since his lips touched hers , sending fire throughout her whole body ."
"she could n't believe how soft his lips were , how gentle his kiss ."
"she was n't expecting anything , not sure if he would be demanding or gentle , but this kiss , this sensuousness and excitement was completely sidetracking her resistance ."
"she wanted to both curl up against him so she could relish the feeling of his lips against hers while at the same time , pull off his clothes and ravish him ."
"she was n't sure what would happen with either but she certainly was n't prepared for this slow assault on her senses ."
"they stood there , kissing on the terrace for who knows how long , his mouth slanting against hers over and over again ."
"she was n't aware of time passing or of the night sky deepening ."
"all she was aware of was his mouth on hers , his tongue tasting her , of demanding and then giving back the pleasure she craved so desperately ."
"she knew , deep down , that this was n't right ."
"that something was missing ."
"but at the moment , as his mouth touched hers again , she could n't think that anything was wrong ."
"it was so completely right that she could n't fight him ."
"would she have been able to fight him if he 'd been less gentle ?"
"she was n't sure ."
"he was usually so demanding , so unequivocal in his needs ."
"but tonight , after crying so hard and fighting against him for what seemed like ages , she did n't have the strength to deny either of them this night ."
"`` tell me you want this , '' zayn demanded , lifting his head slightly to look down at her ."
"ella thought about it for only a small moment before she lifted herself higher , her lips catching his once again ."
"`` i want this right now . ''"
"`` will you want it tomorrow ? ''"
"he asked , groaning when she put her hands against his arms ."
"she did n't want to worry about that at the moment ."
"`` i do n't know ."
"let 's just take it one moment at a time . ''"
"he thought about that for a second before he pulled her up into his arms ."
"carrying her inside , he set her down in the dimly lit bedroom , right beside the enormous bed that she 'd never slept in ."
"and she suspected that she would n't be sleeping in it tonight either ."
"she was n't aware of the belt of her robe coming undone , but she knew the instant her nightgown slipped from her shoulders to pool at her feet ."
"she 'd lost so much weight that there was nothing to stop it but zayn did n't notice her weight loss so much as he noticed her magnificent nakedness ."
"`` you 're more beautiful than i remembered , '' he breathed a moment before he took one breast in his mouth , laving the peak and making her squirm in his arms ."
"when he laid her down on the bed and moved to the other breast , ella could n't believe how much she 'd missed this man , his touch and how he could fire her blood ."
"`` do n't make me wait , '' she pleaded , her fingers in his hair as she held him there over her ."
"one leg rose up so it was resting against his hip and she wanted so desperately to lift her hips and find his heat ."
"but she was trapped under his weight and she could only wiggle slightly ."
"`` i 've wanted you for too long to take this quickly , '' he told her with his deep , gravelly voice that sent shivers of anticipation through her whole body ."
"`` we 're going to take this slow and i 'm going to enjoy every moment . ''"
"`` so are you , '' he promised with a look in his eyes that sent yet another thrill down her body ."
"ella almost laughed , but at that moment , his leg slipped between hers so he could settle between them ."
"she could n't help the moan that escaped her lips or the trembling that started when his mouth moved from her breasts down to her stomach ."
"she wanted this so badly , she was almost climaxing with just his mouth on her stomach ."
"his fingers and hands were teasing ."
"his light touch drove her insane with need and she shifted underneath him , telling him without words what she desperately needed ."
"`` slow next time , '' she gasped when she could n't take his light touch any longer ."
"too frustrated , she pushed on his shoulders while she sat up , pressing him backwards with a determined expression on her face ."
"zayn looked up at her as he lay back against the bed ."
"`` you know i can switch our positions easily , '' he growled ."
"but then his hands moved up her waist , higher until he was cradling her breasts in each of his hands ."
"when his thumbs skimmed over her nipples , he smiled mercilessly when she cried out ."
"what he was n't prepared for was her aggressiveness ."
"so when she pushed backwards , he was suddenly inside of her , her heat wrapping around him like a hot , wet glove ."
"for the life of him , he could n't slow down now ."
"he was exactly where he wanted to be and she felt even better than he remembered ."
"ella took a deep breath , surprised at how large he was ."
"as her body slowly adjusted to his size , she felt her shoulder muscles relax , but at the same time , her stomach tightened , her legs clenched his hips and she threw her head back in triumph ."
"`` think you 're in control , eh ? ''"
"he teased , but then she started moving , lifting her hips up higher and he pressed his head backwards , his whole body tensed in anticipation of her coming back down , of her heat taking him in again ."
"when she hesitated at the top , he opened his eyes , about to growl out but his hands took hold of her hips and pulled her back downwards ."
"she gasped , her palms flat against his chest ."
"and she lifted herself higher again ."
"this time , zayn let her have her way , his eyes opened as he watched in fascination as ella discovered her body once again ."
"and discovered the power she had over him ."
"the look on her face , the heat in her eyes and the blush staining her chest and cheeks , was so powerfully erotic , he could only lay there , watching her with fascination ."
"`` okay , you 're in control , '' he said and saw her full , pink lips smile slightly with the power he 'd just given her ."
"it might kill him , he thought , but what a way to go !"
"he let his hands slide down her legs , trailing along her bottom and even lower ."
"when she continued to ride him , her body moving however she wanted , he could barely hang on ."
"he 'd never seen anyone look as beautiful as ella at this moment ."
"when he knew he could n't take much more , he slipped his hands higher , his fingers joining in ."
"when he felt her climax start , he could n't hold back his own ."
"in one swift move , he picked her up and reversed their positions , taking her scream in his mouth as they both climaxed together ."
"chapter 10 ella woke up and instantly knew something was wrong ."
"looking around , she realized that she was alone !"
"in zayn 's enormous bed , surrounded by cotton sheets so soft they felt like satin , she looked around the room , furious that he would be gone already ."
"it was barely dawn !"
"how could he do this again ?"
"especially after the night they 'd shared ."
"he 'd made love to her so many times and in so many ways , she was astounded by his endurance and creativity ."
"she looked around the room , holding the sheet over her nakedness , initially with hope that he was just in the bathroom or coming back to bed , and then with humiliation as her mind absorbed the silence ."
"he 'd done it to her again !"
"how could she be so gullible ?"
"a pair of strong arms , a kind word and she was putty in his hands ."
"she was also exhausted but she pulled herself out of bed , knowing that she 'd never be able to get back to sleep again ."
"she was too angry to think about getting back to sleep at this point anyway , her mind calling him every possible name she could think of ."
"she showered quickly , then dressed in a simple navy suit with slacks this time ."
"she did n't have an agenda today since she avoided all of her lessons but her mind sifted through the issues she wanted to deal with ."
"the primary one was discovering who was in charge of the palace staff and finding out how to hire her own servants to help her ."
"this standoff between herself and the servants was going to end today !"
"coffee , she told herself ."
"since it was so early in the morning , the irritating coffee service had n't been delivered yet so she walked down the hallway towards the administrative offices ."
"she knew where to find her morning coffee now and headed towards the small kitchen ."
"when she arrived , the offices were eerily quiet ."
"since it was barely dawn , she knew that most people were probably just making their way out of bed ."
"she did n't mind though ."
"it was actually a relief to be able to make her own coffee ."
"smiling , she absently tapped her platinum wedding ring against the inexpensive coffee cup , thinking through possible action plans ."
"she heard a noise but thought it might just be the first of the staff coming in for work ."
"but as she listened to the sounds of the coffee percolating , the other sounds broke into her conscious thoughts , sounds of feet shuffling and mumbling , grew louder and more consistent ."
"it did n't sound like one or two people arriving to work ."
"it sounded like an entire crowd of people walking to their desks ."
"she peered around the kitchen wall , not wanting to be caught but what she saw startled her ."
"in a single line , she saw the kitchen staff , the maids assigned to zayn 's private suite , the cleaning staff and even the stable hands were all marching into an elaborate , glassed-in conference room ."
"it looked odd and all of them had a wary expression on their faces ."
"what was going on ?"
"the coffee finished and she turned back to pour herself a cup ."
"she considered just leaving the kitchen and heading back to zayn 's rooms , but her conscience got the better of her and she lifted the pot , found a tray and set several cups onto the tray ."
"those people all looked rather frazzled so they probably had n't had their morning coffee ."
"she did n't think they deserved her freshly brewed coffee , but it did n't feel right just leaving them ."
"this coffee might go to waste anyway depending on what time the administrative staff arrived ."
"it was so early in the morning that if she left it on the burner , it might just scald the bottom of the pot and the coffee itself , making it undrinkable ."
"she was carrying the tray out to the conference room , about to offer everyone a cup for whatever meeting was about to start when she heard zayn 's commanding voice ."
"`` is this everyone ? ''"
"he asked a man who was standing to his left ."
"after receiving a positive reply , ella watched through the glass as zayn looked over the group of people , all of them shamefaced for some reason ."
"`` i 've brought all of you here to demand an explanation for the treatment of my wife over the past few weeks ."
"it is my understanding that each one of you have sabotaged her stay here in some way , making her life miserable . ''"
"turning to the chef , he glared at the man ."
"`` you have created inedible food , almost poisoning her in your efforts at retribution . ''"
"to the stable man who had brought out that vicious horse , `` and you have endangered her life by bringing brutus as her first horse ."
"that horse is for me to ride only and you know it ."
"he 's evil to anyone but me . ''"
"turning to the others , he said , `` her coffee is undrinkable , her clothes have gone unattended , her meals are ruined , her life put in danger and her emotions toyed with ."
"all because i brought a woman into your midst that you do n't approve of ."
"i can not believe each of you would commit treason in such a manner ! ''"
"as she watched zayn tear into each individual , explaining their `` crimes '' , her heart melted at how angry he was ."
"and all on her behalf ."
"the man was a terror , she realized ."
"this was the man she remembered from her childhood and it warmed places within her that had been cold and in pain for the past six years ."
"as she watched and listened , ella knew instantly that she 'd fallen in love with this man ."
"she could n't believe it nor did she have any idea when it had happened , but it was true ."
"otherwise , she never would have been so hurt by his betrayal that morning six years ago and she never would have been so affected by him over the past few weeks ."
"it seemed almost ridiculous to think that she could have fallen in love with a man she 'd known for such a short time , but there was n't any other explanation ."
"it forced her to think about the real reasons why she was so resistant to him ."
"and the realization made her ashamed ."
"she 'd fallen so hard for him , but she 'd been alone and scared and now she was getting back at him , exactly as she 'd thought last night before he 'd come into their suite ."
"she still would have been angry and scared after finding out she was pregnant , alone and unemployed , but that had been as much her fault as it was his ."
"she could n't blame him for that since he had n't known what was going on ."
"of course , if he 'd stayed around that morning , or kept in contact with her after their one night , she would have told him of her pregnancy ."
"it suddenly occurred to her that she 'd been with dorothy that first night after she 'd been fired from the hotel ."
"her friend had showed up that afternoon to her apartment , following ella home from the hotel ."
"even if zayn had tried to contact her , she had n't been around ."
"she 'd been at dorothy 's house with no phone , no contact information , no way for him to discover her whereabouts ."
"she 'd been living off the radar for months until max was born ."
"maybe zayn was telling her the truth about trying to contact her , to find her ."
"maybe he 'd tried for a while but , when there was no trace of her , which there would n't have been because dorothy would n't dare tell anyone where ella had gone , he 'd given up and tried to move on with his life ."
"she looked at him through the conference room windows , her heart lightening for the first time in a long time ."
"she could n't believe how nice it was to not be angry with him ."
"suddenly , the world felt different , brighter , nicer ."
"kinder and much more exciting !"
"her eyes focused on the group in the room ."
"she 'd seen zayn in many different ways , but she honestly could n't say she 'd ever seen him as a ruler ."
"theoretically , she knew that she was ruler of tusain , but since she had n't been outside of the palace since she 'd arrived , she 'd never seen a demonstration of his authority ."
"she 'd only seen the side of him that he 'd allowed her to view ."
"she cringed as she realized she was witnessing his power now ."
"he might not have been born into this life , but he 'd certainly adapted to his position ."
"he had those staff members cowering with his anger , not to mention the words he was using were terrifying ."
"there was a universal gasp as each of the attendees realized what their ruler was saying ."
"`` i do n't want any excuses or explanations ."
"i will not charge any of you with treason , but you need to understand why i love this woman ."
"six years ago , i met a beautiful woman who 's smile warmed my heart and made my anger over my new position go away for one night ."
"she was sweet and kind and did n't know anything of life ."
"while i was struggling over my newfound responsibilities and working night and day to resolve so many of the problems of tusain , she was struggling to bring herself out of the slums , out of poverty ."
"she was putting herself through school , she was working two different jobs so she could afford a place to live that did n't include daily drive-by shootings ."
"and she was working at a job that was tedious and menial , but she was doing an outstanding job at it ."
"she 'd even lied on her application in order to get that job . ''"
"ella did n't know how he 'd learned some of that , but her heart swelled with love for the man who was defending her so righteously ."
"`` she got pregnant after one night with me but even as an eighteen year old , out in the world with no job , no future and no hope , she did n't give up our child ."
"she somehow figured out a way to give birth to your future ruler , my son ! ''"
"his voice was soft and dangerous now and everyone in the room knew of his fury , could feel it emanating and wafting among them ."
"`` as soon as i found out , i married her , brought her and my son here even over her protests ."
"the woman was offered a role as my wife which i thought would include living in luxury , never again worrying about where her next meal would be or how she would pay the rent or feed our son ."
"she begged me to just leave her and max back in the united states ."
"she did n't want this life ."
"she wanted to go on living and working as she had before but i would n't allow it ."
"so what did i do ?"
"i packed both of them up and shipped them to my home , only to dump her into a hellish , hostile environment ."
"all of you have dishonored me ."
"i am ashamed to have given you a job and refuge under my name but you are all terminated as of this moment . ''"
"`` no ! ''"
"ella gasped , standing outside the conference room , still holding the tray containing the coffee pot and cups ."
"she realized that her arms were aching from holding the tray for so long but she rushed into the conference room , setting the tray down on the table before turning to face zayn ."
"`` you ca n't fire them , '' she told him firmly ."
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"he demanded , pulling her close and tucking her under his arm , protecting her with his body as well as his name ."
"and she loved him even more for that show of support ."
"`` i come here to get coffee each morning , '' she whispered , trying to soothe his anger but her statement only increased his ire ."
"turning to the maid who delivered the coffee service each morning , he glared at her and ella felt horrible for the woman who shrunk down , cringing in the face of zayn 's formidable wrath ."
"`` you ca n't fire them , zayn , '' she whispered , looking up into his dark , terrifying eyes ."
"`` give me one good reason why i should n't . ''"
"he looked down at her , then back at the crowd who were all shivering with fear ."
"she turned to face him , putting a hand to the middle of his chest ."
"`` because i think i understand why they were doing this to me . ''"
"`` it does n't matter why , they dishonored me and my name ."
"they dishonored everything that i have been working for . ''"
"she soothed him by stepping closer , giving him a gentle hug ."
"`` i know ."
"but understand their motives ."
"they were actually protecting you . ''"
"before he could interrupt her again , she shook her head gently ."
"`` they knew i was n't ... '' how did she say this delicately , `` acting completely as your wife , '' she finally replied with a painful blush ."
"`` and they were angry with me for that ."
"they were angry with me for not fully committing to this relationship with you and they were acting out of loyalty ."
"they risked their employment and their futures because they love and respect you ."
"because they know what a good ruler you are and were angry with me for not seeing it as well . ''"
"`` you are my wife ! ''"
"he snapped , holding her upper arms ."
"`` they disrespected you as well . ''"
"she could n't disagree with that ."
"and they 'd made her life a living hell for several weeks ."
"`` yes , they did ."
"but they were only looking out for you ."
"and if they have that kind of fearless courage to withstand your wrath , i want each of them to be here , to convey that loyalty to max and help him grow up ."
"i do n't want any of them terminated over what they 've done to me . ''"
"`` i ca n't let this go , '' he argued ."
"`` i wo n't allow them near you again . ''"
"she bit her lip and tried to come up with a compromise ."
"`` i love you , '' she whispered ."
"`` will you trust me ? ''"
"he pulled her against him , hugging her gently ."
"`` what are you going to do ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` serve them all coffee ? ''"
"he 'd just noticed the tray with coffee and cups on the conference table ."
"he squeezed her once again ."
"`` i ca n't believe that you were going to serve your staff coffee after all that they 've put you through . ''"
"she shrugged her shoulder ."
"`` they did n't look very happy when they were parading in here ."
"although i did n't know why and did n't expect you to be firing them ."
"or accusing them of treason . ''"
"`` you 're my queen , ella ."
"it is treason what they did to you . ''"
"she laughed and shook her head ."
"`` i do n't feel like a queen . ''"
"he pulled her closer ."
"`` what do you want me to do ? ''"
"she rested her cheek against his chest , running through different possibilities in her mind ."
"`` will you let me handle this ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he looked down at her , searching her face for a clue as to what she might do ."
"`` yes , '' he finally said ."
"`` as long as i 'm still in the loop and can beat anyone who disrespects you again . ''"
"she smiled at his threat ."
"`` i know you would n't physically hurt anyone , '' she said but missed the look that said 'you have no idea ' because she turned back to the crowd , leaning slightly against zayn since he wrapped his arm around her waist ."
"`` each one of you may keep your jobs . ''"
"she waited just long enough to hear the sighs of relief travel through the room ."
"`` today , '' she went on sternly ."
"`` each of you will have your job each day but if there 's so much as a single infraction , your employment will be terminated by the end of that day ."
"you will be stripped of your clearance and ability to work in the government and will be escorted out of the palace by the guards . ''"
"her eyes traveled around the room , looking at each person to ensure that they understood her resolve ."
"`` i not only approve of , but applaud , your loyalty to my husband and my son ."
"but i guarantee that he and i will have our differences ."
"sometimes that will result in a fight between the two of us ."
"but not a single person will relay anything they hear to another human being ."
"is that clear ? ''"
"she waited for them to nod their head ."
"`` that means that , if you hear me snap at him in the dining room , no one in the bedrooms will hear about it ."
"and if a reporter every gets wind of anything happening in the private lives of me , my husband or my children , every single person on staff will be terminated ."
"so it is up to each of you to ensure that every other person on the staff respects our privacy ."
"and i mean , if i get pregnant , there will be no slips to the press until we make the official announcement ."
"if i decide to wear a purple gown to dinner one night , there will be zero knowledge of that outside of official pictures . ''"
"she looked around , each of them starting to straighten up , pull back their shoulders , as they realized that , not only were they going to be able to keep their jobs , but they would have an awesome responsibility to maintain an almost impossible level of privacy ."
"she felt zayn 's arm tighten and took that as a signal of his support and approval ."
"but she kept her shoulders squared off and her head held high as she continued ."
"`` i do n't care how tempting it is to sell secrets and gossip to the media ."
"each and every one of you will be summarily fired if anything leaks to the press about the private lives of my family . ''"
"she thought quickly , trying to come up with additional ways to protect herself and her family which now included zayn although how he 'd snuck into her heart , she 'd never understand ."
"`` you will all sign non-disclosure statements that will apply for your entire lifetime and the lifetime of my family ."
"never , under any circumstances , will any news of any of our foibles be leaked to the press or any other member of the staff unless we 've directed such information to be released through official channels ."
"i 'll work with the lawyers to ensure that the punishment for any violations of this contract will be severe ."
"is that understood ? ''"
"every single person nodded their heads , agreeing with her terms ."
"with a sigh of relief , she looked around and instinctively knew that she 'd earned everyone 's support and trust ."
"it would still take time to earn their respect , but she suddenly felt up to the challenge ."
"`` that will be all , '' she heard zayn say from behind her ."
"as a group , every person bowed low and walked out of the conference room ."
"ella watched with relief as they all left , their heads low as if they knew that they 'd done wrong and their hides had all been saved today ."
"once they were alone in the conference room , zayn turned her around so he could see her face ."
"`` did you mean what you said ? ''"
"she asked shyly , peeking up through her long lashes ."
"`` every word of it . ''"
"`` even about loving me ? ''"
"she whispered , his stern expression intimidating her slightly ."
"`` you do n't have to say things like that if they are n't true ."
"i know that we 're here because of max and you married me because you did n't want to lose him . ''"
"he chuckled softly , leaning against the conference room table so he was a bit lower and he could see her pale features more clearly ."
"`` i married you because , for the past six years , i had n't been able to get you out of my mind ."
"and when i saw you again , all i could think about was getting you back into my bed ."
"as well as never letting you leave it . ''"
"he laughed derisively as he said , `` i did n't know that i 'd be going through three weeks of hell , watching you walk around , taunting me with your lovely body and wanting you more than i 've ever wanted any other woman in my life ."
"that was painful . ''"
"she rolled her eyes ."
"`` what about you ?"
"undressing in front of me , making me crazy with lust ."
"unfair ! ''"
"she came back ."
"one of his dark eyebrows went up and he laughed ."
"`` i did n't know you 'd even noticed ."
"you gave a good impression of a woman completely oblivious to me . ''"
"she snorted , a very un-queen-like sound ."
"`` as if anyone could ignore you , '' she laughed ."
"turning serious , she said , `` thank you for defending me like that ."
"it was very sweet , '' `` i should have realized what was happening before now ."
"i 'm sorry you 've been so miserable the past three weeks . ''"
"she shrugged ."
"`` i love you , '' she said , then held her breath , waiting for his reaction ."
"she waited a long time , her whole body tense and worried ."
"`` do you mean it , ella ?"
"do n't say that if you do n't honestly mean it ."
"because i 'll never let you take back the words . ''"
"`` i mean it ."
"i might go crazy loving you , but i really do , '' she sighed ."
"`` i love you too ."
"you 've driven me crazy long enough . ''"
"he bent low and kissed her gently but the kiss turned into something completely different , something more , something that shattered any remaining hurt she might be feeling about the past ."
"she loved this man , could n't get enough of him and wanted to spend the rest of her life making him happy ."
"she pulled back slightly and took a breath ."
"`` will you do one thing for me though ? ''"
"`` i 'll do anything you ask . ''"
"she took a fist full of his shirt in both of her hands ."
"`` do n't leave me in the morning ! ''"
"she growled ."
"`` i hate waking up after a night like last night and not having you there ! ''"
"she laid her forehead down on his chest , ignoring the laughter grumbling through his body ."
"`` how about if i take you back to bed right now and show you that i will be beside you when you wake up ? ''"
"she smiled and looked up at him ."
"`` and maybe we could start on your daughter ? ''"
"she asked shyly ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she heard max 's voice say from behind her ."
"both ella and zayn stood up and looked down at their little boy who was angrily glaring back at them ."
"`` i do n't want a sister ! ''"
"she stomped his tennis shoe shod foot ."
"`` i want a brother ! ''"
"ella stared at her son with amazement ."
"`` and where did you come from ? ''"
"she asked , watching as zayn bent down and lifted him into his arms ."
"`` ms. miller said you had a meeting in here and i wanted to make sure you were okay , '' he said , his little-boy eyes softening as he took in his mother 's happy face ."
"`` you 've been sad lately so i was going to bring you some cookies . ''"
"he looked at his nanny , then back to his father with his head shaking ."
"`` she said you might like a flower instead , '' he replied , and opened his hand to reveal a crushed , white rose ."
"`` i guess i messed it up when i heard you wanted to make a sister for me . ''"
"he looked at his father , scrunching up his nose ."
"`` i do n't really like girls . ''"
"zayn stared at his son for a long moment , then burst out laughing ."
"`` i 'm going to quote you on that in a few years , '' he said ."
"`` we 'll take him to breakfast , '' he said to ms. miller who was standing behind the doors to the conference room ."
"the three of them walked down the hallway , listening to max chat about what was coming up today ."
"ella walked next to zayn , his free arm wrapped around her waist and her head resting against his strong shoulder ."
"`` thank you , '' she whispered , not wanting to interrupt max , but wanting to let zayn know how grateful she was to him for ... just being himself ."
"`` i love you ."
"truly i do , '' she whispered ."
"she knew that he heard her because he squeezed her waist slightly as they walked to the dining room ."
"throughout the entire , delicious meal , she kept peeking at zayn and feeling a warm glow when she found him staring right back at her ."
"yes , life would be better now , she thought with happiness surrounding her ."
"prologue your majesty : i am sorry to ask you for advice but i have no one to turn to at this point ."
"i have used up all of my resources trying to resolve the situation but nothing has fixed the problem ."
"i am imposing upon your letter of years ago where you offered help raising electra after her father 's untimely death ."
"simply put , the child is out of control ."
"she is running with the wrong crowd and , as she reaches her teen years , i fear for her safety and her future ."
"if her father were around , i would trust that he would know how to stop her dangerous behavior ."
"but since his death five years ago , electra has just become more and more unmanageable ."
"i understand that she is hurting from the loss of her last parent , but i ca n't seem to get through to her and teach her to stop ."
"in my old age , i fear i am unable to provide more than love and kisses , which is n't up to the task any longer ."
"any advice would be wonderful ."
"sincerely , edna knight electra 's grandmother `` you called , father ? ''"
"dharran rashid abbas , sheik of sandura asked as he walked into his father '' s private study ."
"`` yes , '' the king said weakly ."
"`` sit down , '' he waved to a chair beside his bed ."
"dharr immediately sat down , pulling the blanket higher over his father '' s chest , the worry eating into him while he maintained a calm exterior for his father '' s benefit ."
"`` read this , '' the king said , handing the letter to dharr ."
"dharr read through the words quickly , then glanced at his father ."
"`` this is your ward ?"
"the girl you have been caring forsince the incident ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"the bullet was meant for me but her father selflessly dove in front of me , protecting me at the cost of his own life . ''"
"no expression came over dharr '' s face , but the assassination attempt had dramatically changed his way of looking at security issues ."
"`` the mother died years earlier , correct ? ''"
"`` that '' s correct ."
"it will be up to you to ensure for this girl '' s safety now . ''"
"dharr suppressed the horror that his father '' s words provoked inside him ."
"he shook his head confidently ."
"`` no father , you will survive this bout just as you have all the others ."
"you need to have hope and be strong . ''"
"the king smiled wanly but then became serious again ."
"`` you owe her your life as well ."
"without the sacrifice of her father , you would have been king years ago ."
"now that you have had time , you are ready to carry on the throne ."
"you are strong and powerful which would not have been the case if i had died that time.her father '' s sacrifice allowed me more time to guide you and teach you about the world and ruling our kingdom . ''"
"`` you are still strong , '' dharr commanded sternly as if the force of his voice could make it so ."
"the king took his son '' s hand earnestly , wanting to make sure the responsibility was understood ."
"`` listen , my son ."
"you must protect this girl as i have done ."
"she is now your ward ."
"she has only her grandmother ."
"there is money being sent for her care every month but if she ever needs anything else , you must ensure that she is cared for and protected . ''"
"`` i will see to it , father , '' dharr said immediately ."
"`` the grandparents are very nice , but are also older than i am ."
"they can '' t be expected to turn this wild child into a presentable adult ."
"it will be up to you ."
"they will give her the love she needs ."
"you will give her the protection . ''"
"`` yes , father , '' dharr agreed ."
"`` i will set someone upon the task this afternoon . ''"
"`` good . ''"
"the king '' s eyes shut and dharr froze in his seat until he noticed the slight rise and fall of his father '' s chest ."
"breathing more easily , dharr stood up and walked quietly out of the bedroom and down the palace hallways to his own office ."
"handing the letter to his aide , he said , `` put some body guards on this woman ."
"her name is electra knight ."
"i believe she is about sixteen years old ."
"the guards should protect her around the clock and pull her out of any trouble she gets into ."
"she should be guarded as if she were my sister . ''"
"the aide quickly took the letter while efficiently writing down the instructions at the same time , nodding his head as well ."
"`` i will make it happen . ''"
"`` tonight , '' dharr said ."
"`` yes , your highness . ''"
"chapter 1 eight years later electra knight stood in the small but elegant restaurant feeling nervous but determined ."
"`` this has to work , '' she whispered to herself before taking a sip of hot coffee ."
"the caffeine immediately went to her system , giving her an alertness she '' d been lacking earlier ."
"the stress of preparing for this meeting , and all it could do for her future , had kept her up last night worrying ."
"looking straight ahead , she went through her speech one more time although she '' d rehearsed it over and over again ."
"she didn '' t look to her right or left , knowing the sight of the bulky men seated at nearby tables would only make her furious and resentful ."
"she needed all her wits about her in order to make this work and negative emotions would only fog her brain ."
"she had only five minutes with king dharr abbas ."
"five minutes to convince the man to get rid of the guards ."
"they were destroying her life and driving her crazy in the meantime ."
"pulling the newspaper forward , she idly skimmed through the front page articles ."
"she was a half hour early for her appointment and she really should check the job openings ."
"unfortunately , her focus was not on the words describing possible jobs but on her upcoming interviewwith the man who '' s orders had destroyed what little was left of her normal childhood ."
"he '' d stolen her father '' s life and then , in an attempt to ease a guilty conscience , had placed guards on her around the clock ."
"as if the guards could take the place of the man she '' d lost !"
"it was ridiculous and she had to make it stop before more of her life was turned upside down by the ridiculous guards ."
"eight years ago , the men had showed up unexpectedly at a party she '' d been att ending ."
"it had been horribly embarrassing since she was playing spin the bottle and was thrilled when the bottle had stopped spinning on danny miller , the cutest boy in school ."
"she was just about to lean over and kiss him when one of the men came down into the basement where they were playing the relatively innocent game ."
"the man standing at the bottom of the stairs didn '' t do anything at all ."
"he simply stood there , his arms crossed over his chest watching electra ."
"all the others in the room were completely intimidated , as she was but electra was the only one willing to stand there and question the man ."
"`` excuse me , what can we do for you ? ''"
"she asked , planting her hands on her slender , sixteen year old hips ."
"`` i '' m here at the request of your grandmother and prince abbas . ''"
"electra '' s jaw immediately dropped ."
"`` are you serious ? ''"
"at the time , the prince '' s name only reminded her of the man her father had worked for and lost his life for , taking a bullet meant for the king ."
"resentment welled up inside her at the representative of the man who , in her teenage mind , had killed her father ."
"`` absolutely , miss , '' the man said , his face impassive as he looked down at her ."
"`` for what purpose ? ''"
"she demanded , irritated immediately at her grandmother '' s interference ."
"king what '' s-his-name was only a face in a far away country ."
"her grandmother was here , close by and therefore , electra determined that she was a much better target than a faceless ruler ."
"the guard at the bottom of the stairs looked at her impassively , not impressed with her teenage hostility ."
"`` i am here to protect you ."
"from yourself if necessary , '' he clarified , his eyes moving to the teens behind her ."
"electra didn '' t like the sound of that ."
"`` my grandmother requested a goon to stand watch over me ?"
"that '' s ridiculous ."
"i can take care of myself . ''"
"her tone was purposefully insulting but the man didn '' t even blink ."
"`` i believe your grandmother thought differently , '' was all he said , his dark eyes looking across to her with no emotion ."
"her fists balled up under her arms and she considered punching the man , but his bulging muscles would probably protect him ."
"`` and do i have any say in this matter ?"
"i mean , '' she harrumphed , looking back at her friends and danny in particular to gain support , `` no one here is going to do anything wrong , '' she lied ."
"the man didn '' t respond ."
"his silence only infuriated her more ."
"electra was known throughout school as someone who spoke her mind , was daring and challenged authority ."
"this was obviously not going as it normally would ."
"`` well , what '' s your name ? ''"
"she asked , mimicking his crossed arms , her anger increasing several notches with his uncommunicative demeanor and inability to be intimidated or even irritated by her attitude ."
"usually , she was quite adept at producing some sort of emotion in all the people she met , either frustration , irritation or outright anger ."
"she liked that one the best ."
"people '' s guard comes down when they are angry and she could get away with more things ."
"`` you may call me micka . ''"
"electra eyed the man carefully for a long moment ."
"`` you work for me ? ''"
"`` in a sense , '' he responded ."
"`` good , '' she brightened , her face breaking out into a bright smile ."
"`` then head on upstairs and wait for me there ."
"i '' ll be up in a while . ''"
"the man didn '' t return her smile ."
"he simply stood his ground , unblinking as he watched her ."
"her hands dropped and she waved them forward as if he were a heard of sheep she was trying to get out of the road ."
"`` go on !"
"get out !"
"i don '' t want you down here , '' she said , becoming embarrassed that the man was intimidating her friends , and more importantly , danny ."
"when he didn '' t move , she got angry ."
"`` what ?"
"are you some sort of baboon ?"
"get out of here !"
"this isn '' t your house ."
"you can '' t be here like this . ''"
"her best friend cleared her throat ."
"`` ellie , maybe we should all head home , '' she suggested from behind electra ."
"that only roused her temper more ."
"she '' d probably missed her opportunity to experience her first kiss , but there were always other opportunities and she meant to make one here , tonight , with danny !"
"`` no ."
"this is ridiculous ."
"this man shouldn '' t be here ."
"i have no need of his protection so he should go ."
"not us . ''"
"the other boys and two other girls laughed selfconsciously ."
"one of them said , `` electra , i '' m not sure how you '' re going to get that man to move , but i '' d better head home ."
"i have homework to do . ''"
"the others chimed in with similar excuses and micka moved slightly to the right , allowing them to ascend the bare , wooden stairs to the main level of the house ."
"`` fine , '' electra spat out ."
"`` i '' d better get home as well . ''"
"she walked around the man , unsure of what he would do to follow her ."
"she pulled her keys out of her purse and offered a wan smile to her friend ."
"`` i '' m sorry about this ."
"i '' ll get it straightened out with gran . ''"
"electra walked up the stairs sadly , knowing that her chance with danny was gone ."
"there might be others , but this one was lost and it was painfully embarrassing ."
"out in the cool , autumn evening , she looked back at micka and smiled secretly ."
"with her keys in her hands , she unlocked her dilapidated car and dove inside ."
"slamming the keys into the ignition , she turned it over and sped away as quickly as possible ."
"racing through the drowsy streets , she sped along , eager to lose the man who had ruined her kiss with danny , the man of her dreams ."
"unfortunately , luck was not on her side ."
"as soon as she turned the corner , the sirens and lights started flashing in her rear view mirror ."
"`` oh , no ! ''"
"she said to the darkness ."
"pulling over , sheknew it wouldn '' t be a good idea to try and out-race the police ."
"adding insult to injury , the black land rover pulled up behind the police officer ."
"without letting her into the conversation , micka and the police officer spoke softly ."
"electra tried to hear the conversation with her window rolled down but nothing came along ."
"she was hoping micka was convincingthe officer that she shouldn '' t get a ticket ."
"could he ?"
"would he ?"
"no luck ."
"`` may i see your license and registration , miss ? ''"
"the officer said sternly ."
"fifteen minutes later , the officer came forward again , handing her the ticket for reckless driving ."
"a moment later , micka was opening the door to her car and pushing her into the passenger seat ."
"`` i '' ll drive , '' he said and started the engine , waving to the officer who immediately laughed before getting back into his cruiser ."
"`` what are you doing ? ''"
"electra demanded ."
"`` put your seatbelt on , '' was micka '' s only reply ."
"first the lost kiss , the not-lost ticket , the shoving aside and now an order ? ''"
"no ! ''"
"she said adamantly ."
"he didn '' t even shrug as he said calmly , `` then we sit here until you do . ''"
"electra '' s mouth dropped open ."
"`` you can '' t do that ! ''"
"micka did not respond ."
"he simply waited , staring out the front window with teeth grinding patience ."
"the battle of wills was soon won that night , but electra was unwilling to accept defeat in the war ."
"unfortunately , she didn '' t know that twenty-four hour surveillance had been posted on her ."
"she discovered that night that sneaking out of her window was a pointless endeavor ."
"as she climbed out the window and shimmied down the tree , strong arms reached up and simply plucked her from the lowest branch , then tossed her over his shoulder and carried her right back to her room ."
"there were five different body guards that protected her , drove her to and from school since the reckless driving incident had her license revoked for two years , and worst of all , rode with her on her very few dates that happened after that night ."
"in college , they slept in a dorm room across the hallway from her and followed her to all her classes ."
"they waited outside the rooms for her to re-emerge , sat at other tables in the library , close but not too close ."
"they tailed her on her dates and made her life safe , but utterly miserable ."
"she went through college and graduate school , all with perfect grades since none of her friends could convince her to defy her guards and non dared to contradict the men who forced her to study when they thought she was mis-behaving ."
"they tested her on all her classes , pushing her harder than the professors to succeed ."
"now , it was all down to this meeting with a man she '' d never met and had grown to hate over the years ."
"she had learned to accept her guards , had even grown to understand their position and respect their abilities ."
"but she '' d never liked the fact that they were there , always with her , always protecting and pushing her ."
"they were all wonderful men , but she hated the imposition they were putting on her lifestyle ."
"she '' d just wanted a normal life and that had been impossible with personal body guards two feet away ."
"and now that she was ready to enter the workforce , she couldn '' t very well go to a job interview with one of them tailing behind her ."
"she '' d never get a job ."
"every employer would be completely intimidated by the fact that she was protected around the clock ."
"`` electra !"
"i '' m over here , '' susan reyes called out from the small coffee shop , waving her hand ."
"electra spied her friend and walked through the tables , a bright smile lighting up her face ."
"`` look at you ! ''"
"she exclaimed , eyeing her friend '' s business suit and name plate that announced she was a lead clerk for the hotel ."
"`` i '' m so impressed ! ''"
"she cried out , swallowing the jealousy that surged up ."
"she was genuinely happy for her friend , but also wished for the same kind of opportunities ."
"susan laughed ."
"`` don '' t worry ."
"you '' ll get your chance ."
"you '' re going to be wonderfully convincing in your meeting in a little while . ''"
"she smiled as she looked across the small , linen covered table at her friend ."
"`` and let me just say that your choice of outfits is smashing !"
"the pink color looks wonderful with your skin tone and brings out the green in your eyes . ''"
"electra glanced down at her suit and smoothed the pink wool covering her lap ."
"`` are you sure it '' s okay ?"
"i changed about four times , the outfits ranging from defiant jeans to a severe black pant suit . ''"
"susan nodded her head emphatically and poured electra some coffee from the decanter already on the table ."
"`` it '' s perfect ."
"the pink will show him you '' re not afraid of your feminine side but the cut of the suit demonstrates that you '' re smart and mean business . ''"
"electra sighed and grimaced slightly ."
"`` i '' m not sure i wanted to show him my feminine side ."
"that might be a mistake . ''"
"`` nonsense ."
"you look great . ''"
"electra smiled at the encouragement and changed the subject ."
"no matter what she was wearing , it was too late to change now ."
"she was meeting king abbas in an hour and it had taken her forty five minutes to get here as it was ."
"knowing that worrying about her outfit was a futile exercise , she quickly changed the subject ."
"`` so tell me about this new boyfriend of yours , '' she said , adding cream and sugar to her coffee ."
"susan '' s eyes closed as if she '' d just taken a bite of rich , darkchocolate ."
"`` oh , he '' s just wonderful ."
"his name is barry and he '' s an accountant for one of the big firms ."
"we met at last week '' s happy hour and i have found over the past seven days that he '' s a wonderfully charming man , full of intelligence and humor and makes me feel all giddy inside . ''"
"electra sighed with longing ."
"`` was that the one at o '' hooligan '' s ?"
"i didn '' t notice you with anyone last week , '' she said ."
"her friend '' s eyes shuttered ."
"`` you left early , '' susan replied carefully , knowing this was a touchy subject ."
"electra grimaced again ."
"`` i had to ."
"micha was scaring everyone away . ''"
"her comment only made her more resolute to make sure the meeting today worked out the way she planned ."
"susan nodded and tried to hide her expression ."
"`` he '' s a little intimidating . ''"
"clearing away the irritation over her guards `` imposing disposition , she changed the subject back to something more interesting ."
"`` how many dates have you been on with this new mr ."
"wonderful ? ''"
"susan smiled and her eyes glowed with excitement ."
"`` we '' ve been out with each other every day and night for the past week , '' she enthused ."
"`` he meets me for lunch and we talk and laugh about our days , '' she explained , closing her eyes as she thought back to her dates with mr ."
"wonderful , `` then he picks me up after work and we either go out to dinner or we cook at each other '' s flats ."
"he '' s incredibly romantic . ''"
"electra '' s eyes widened in fascination ."
"`` nights ? ''"
"she confirmed ."
"susan nodded emphatically ."
"`` yes !"
"he '' s a great lover ."
"very generous and sweet . ''"
"`` you went home with him that first night ? ''"
"she asked again , trying to hide her shock ."
"she was fascinated as well , wishing she had that option with men ."
"but her guard would never allow that to happen ."
"she was well protected , to the point that she was now twenty four years old and the closest she got to having sex was reading about it in greek or roman mythology ."
"electra sighed ."
"`` i '' m so jealous ! ''"
"susan laughed ."
"`` another hour and you '' ll be with your guardian to explain the situation ."
"don '' t worry , everything will be fine once you simply tell himthat you '' re an adult and can make your own decisions without the interference of your guards . ''"
"electra looked down at her coffee and sighed heavily ."
"`` i hope so ."
"i '' d do just about anything to have a real relationship with a man . ''"
"susan leaned forward , glancing carefully back at the guard sitting several tables away to make sure they couldn '' t hear her next question ."
"`` have you ever kissed someone , electra ? ''"
"electra '' s eyes sharpened with frustration and resentment ."
"and not a small amount of embarrassment either ."
"`` no ."
"about eight years ago , i almost had the chance with a very cute boy but that '' s the day micha showed up ."
"ever since then , no man has ever ventured out on a second date with me . ''"
"electra knew that being twenty four and never having experienced a kiss was very , very odd ."
"susan shook her head in disgust ."
"`` that '' s awful , and so unfair !"
"how are you supposed to find a guy when none are willing to get close to you ? ''"
"`` exactly ."
"i '' d do just about anything at this point . ''"
"`` even marriage ? ''"
"electra reared back in horror ."
"`` no way ! ''"
"she exclaimed , laughing slightly ."
"`` i '' m not going into a marriage without knowing the man ."
"look at how many relationships our friends have had , trying to find the man of their dreams ? ''"
"susan didn '' t need to be convinced ."
"she was of the group that thought women should live and have fun before settling down with one man for the rest of her life ."
"`` exactly !"
"you don '' t really know a guy until you '' ve lived with him for a while ."
"you have to sample the product before you can buy , '' she teased ."
"`` truths come out with familiarity . ''"
"electra nodded her head , agreeing completely with her friend '' s words ."
"`` i don '' t want to get married even if i find mr ."
"wonderful ."
"i '' ve been protected to the point of being stifled ."
"i '' d like to live a little before i dive into marriage and responsibility . ''"
"`` is jasmine still dating tom ? ''"
"susan asked ."
"they discussed their other friends for the remainder of the time before susan had to go back on duty ."
"electra stayed at the table and picked up the newspaper that had been laying on the table next to her ."
"she pulled out the classifieds , skimming the listings to see if there was anything she might qualify for ."
"but just as it had before , her mind wandered , thinking about the meeting that was about to happen in less than twenty minutes ."
"this meeting today was so important ."
"it was the first time she '' d get to actually meet the man who had made her life so miserable ."
"she had to push her resentment away and focus on her arguments ."
"if she didn '' t get her emotions under control , she wouldn '' t be able to convince the man to ease up the guard that had been assigned to her ."
"she couldn '' t go on job interviews because employers and potential boyfriends alike were intimidated with the guards standing behind her ."
"none would stay outside the building or even outside the interview room ."
"she '' d given up trying to get a job a year ago , and continued to attend university classes ."
"she now had three undergraduate degrees and a master '' s degree in early education ."
"none of them doing her any good since she couldn '' t use them ."
"chapter 2 king abbas walked out of the ballroom with his normal determined stride ."
"`` what is next ? ''"
"he asked his aide who was following beside him ."
"the conference he '' d just left had been tedious but since he '' d been the featured speaker , he had to attend ."
"he smoothed his blue tie down over his crisp white shirt and unbuttoned the black jacket ."
"he was impatient to have this day over with so he could move on to more pressing business ."
"diplomatic travel , although necessary , still felt like an imposition on his time ."
"`` you are meeting next with your ward , your highness , '' he said , reading efficiently off of the electronic hand held device that maintained dharr '' s daily activities ."
"`` she is scheduled to be here in twenty minutes ."
"i have not heard that she has arrived yet . ''"
"dharr nodded his head ."
"`` fine . ''"
"he glanced down at his watch ."
"`` see if she can meet me now ."
"then call the plane and make sure we '' ll be able to take off early ."
"i want to be in paris by dinner , '' he said , thinking about his mistress and her soft , full curves ."
"he had meetings in paris that would last most of the next day but he was looking forward to a relaxing evening with a soft , willing woman ."
"his eyes narrowed slightly when he thought of dominique ."
"this would have to be his last liaison with her ."
"she was becoming too demanding , wanting more than he was willing to give her ."
"her soft curves were nice enough , but her temper was not to be allowed ."
"dharr expected all of his mistresses to be soft and yielding , a place for him to release the stress of his title and obligations ."
"not to add to them ."
"he was just about to give his aide additional instructions when his eye caught sight of the slender beauty sitting in the hotel '' s restaurant ."
"her long , black hair cascaded over her shoulders like a stream of silk , ending in the middle of her back ."
"she was sitting straight , her back not touching the back of the chair and her profile was startling with high cheekbones and a long , elegant neckline ."
"her soft , pink suit hid her curves but he suspected that she would be delightfully endowed ."
"`` hold off on that call , '' he said , vaguely aware that his aide immediately shut the cell phone and fell back slightly ."
"dharr walked forward , his experienced eyes noting other features in the lovely woman that further piqued his interest ."
"her soft , green eyes were dreamy , staring off into space and her full , sensuous lips were slightly parted , as if she were thinking of her lover ."
"within the space of a few moments , dharr determined that he was going to be that man ."
"his mind was already considering the details of how to insert her into the paris apartment and move the demanding dominique out ."
"it never occurred to him that this incredible beauty might resist ."
"women did not resist ."
"ever ."
"if a part of him wanted a challenge where women were concerned , he pushed it aside , cynically knowing that women were after his title , or his wealth , or both and none were very concerned about anything else ."
"the idea passed through his mind quickly but he continued to work on the details as he weaved his way through the tables toward her ."
"his eyes took in her lovely face , her perfect skin and green eyes that looked like soft moss after an early spring rain shower ."
"yes , she would suit his needs perfectly , he told himself ."
"`` excuse me , but may i buy you another cup of coffee ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra looked up and was startled by the appearance of the man in front of her table ."
"but this wasn '' t just any man ."
"this adonis was gorgeous with swarthy , olive skin and almost black eyes that perfectly matched his black hair ."
"his lips were thin but somehow managed to portray a feeling of sensuousness that struck something deep down inside of her ."
"his nose was patrician , hawklike even and she could tell that the man '' s lithe body contained muscles underneath the perfectly tailored dark suit ."
"but it wasn '' t his physical attributes that sent all of her nerves to tingling alert ."
"it was something about the man that just shrieked danger ."
"her mind was screaming run away as fast as possible ."
"but the feminine side of her , the side that craved some sort of male attention that had been denied to her for so long , was crying out for more of this dynamic , dangerous man '' s attention ."
"all of the men she '' d casually been interested in before paled beside this man '' s forceful aura ."
"when he raised an eyebrow , she realized that she '' d been sitting here staring at him for much longer than it was necessary to respond to his query ."
"`` i '' m sorry , '' she gasped ."
"`` coffee , '' she repeated , looking down at her now empty cup , then back up into his face ."
"`` yes ."
"that would be lovely , '' she sighed and was thrilled when he sat down across from her ."
"it wasn '' t that he smiled , but something in his eyes softened slightly ."
"he introduced himself as dharr but nothing more so when he took her hand gently in his , she only replied , `` ellie , '' too confused to remember her given name when his touch was turning her mind to mush ."
"`` what is a beautiful woman like you doing looking for a job ? ''"
"he asked , raising a hand to the waiter that instantly appeared at his elbow ."
"he put in an order for a fresh pot of coffee then turned back to electra ."
"flustered , electra quickly folded the listing of classified ads and shoved it down by her feet ."
"`` oh , you know , always on the lookout for something new , '' she replied , hoping she appeared to be a normal person with normal problems like finding a different job ."
"nervously , she glanced around and noted that gerard , her guard assigned to her today , had melted back to a table farther away and had his back turned to her ."
"relieved by this unprecedented action on his part , she smiled more brightly at the man , wondering what it was about him that assured her guard that she could be trusted when all the others had been instantly intimidated by her guard coming closer ."
"`` you '' re husband should be ashamed of himself for forcing you to work . ''"
"`` oh , i '' m not married , '' she said and took a sip of her coffee ."
"she held the grimace at the dark liquid , too embarrassed to put cream or sugar into her coffee ."
"she didn '' t want to appear silly and childish to the man who drank his black ."
"`` boyfriend ? ''"
"he questioned ."
"`` no ."
"no one , '' she said , her eyelids lowering in an effort to cover the anger in her eyes at that status ."
"she heard the soft chuckle at her reply ."
"`` gauging from the expression you are trying to hide , there '' s more to the story ."
"perhaps you have just broken up with your boyfriend ? ''"
"electra was stunned by the man '' s perceptiveness ."
"`` no ."
"nothing like that , '' she said , but not going further to explain that she '' d never had a boyfriend ."
"creamy , sweet coffee and absolutely no experience with men would not create the sophisticated woman of the world image she was hoping to project ."
"`` are you married ? ''"
"she asked tentatively ."
"he smiled slightly ."
"`` alas , no woman will have me , '' he teased ."
"electra laughed , her eyes skimming over his dark , handsome features and his tall , athletic body and shook her head ."
"`` as you said , i '' m guessing there '' s more to that story than you '' re probably willing to talk about ."
"am i correct ? ''"
"instead of answering her , he took her hand and turned it over ."
"`` you '' re hands are soft , so you don '' t work with them too often ."
"what does a lovely woman like you do during the daytime hours ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she raised her eyebrow in challenge ."
"`` perhaps i work nights , '' she suggested , then blushed at the suggestion that she might be a prostitute ."
"`` i mean ... '' she stammered , `` i don '' t ... that is ... '' she stopped when he laughed softly ."
"`` i know you aren '' t , '' he assured her suavely ."
"she pulled her hand away , miffed for some bizarre reason ."
"`` how can you be so sure ? ''"
"she asked , her chin going up a notch defiantly ."
"`` i could be , '' she said ."
"`` are you saying i don '' t have what it takes to lure men into my bed ? ''"
"she asked , cursing her lack of experience and the blush that crept up her neck to her cheeks ."
"he held her gaze for a long time , amusement lighting his eyes ."
"finally he leaned back and said , `` if you were a prostitute , you would not be in this hotel , '' he explained ."
"`` secondly , ladies of the night don '' t wear pretty pink suits ."
"pink implies romance and femininity ."
"women who sell their bodies wear red or black to promote sexual awareness or mystery . ''"
"sighing , she shook her head in defeat ."
"`` i suppose you '' re right ."
"well , live and learn , '' she said with resignation ."
"she hated being wrong , and it cut deeply right now , with this dynamic man who obviously knew so much about the world ."
"he threw back hishead and laughed ."
"`` are you saying you will rise to the challenge of selling your beautiful body to the highest bidder ? ''"
"electra smiled , feeling as if his laughter were a rare gift ."
"`` no ."
"i don '' t think i could do that to my grandmother ."
"her anglican upbringing would be horrified . ''"
"he chuckled again ."
"`` i don '' t imagine many parents are proud of their children aspiring to become a paid woman ."
"i believe it is done out of a sense of desperation or other factors that don '' t seem to apply in your case . ''"
"`` youhave a point , '' she conceded , but her past made the admission somewhat depressing ."
"`` so now that we '' ve established that you '' re not headed into the oldest profession , what direction are you headed , careerwise ? ''"
"he asked ."
"he knew which direction he was going to head her , straight to his bed , he thought ."
"the more he talked to her , the more enchanted he was ."
"prostitute , indeed !"
"inwardly , he was still laughing at this tiny female '' s audacity ."
"`` i would love to teach children , '' she said ."
"her admission surprised him ."
"she was exceptionally beautiful but he knew that if he '' d had a teacher this lovely , he would have studied much harder , just to impress her ."
"`` what '' s stopping you ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra smiled broadly ."
"`` a stupid , irritating , overbearing jerk who wants to rule my life and make me absolutely miserable , '' she said then bit her tongue , wishing those bitter words hadn '' t been uttered ."
"an explanation would reveal too much and this man was probably only after one thing , the same exact thing she was after , she thought ."
"a night of passion ."
"she suspected that making love with this man would be spectacular but she couldn '' t diminish the potential by being silly and childish , she reminded herself ."
"`` since you don '' t have a husband or a boyfriend , that comment can only be directed towardyour father , '' he assumed ."
"electra didn '' t contradict him and ignored the pain that slanted through her heart at the mention of her father ."
"after more than twelve years , she still missed him terribly ."
"it was just another point against the obnoxious king who had ruined her life ."
"`` what do you do ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` maybe i should get into that business . ''"
"`` why would you want to get into my profession ? ''"
"he asked , sidestepping the question out of habit.that didn '' t stop his surprise that she didn '' t recognize him though ."
"it further intensified his interest ."
"she shrugged delicately and her eyes noticed that his dropped to the small v in her suit jacket ."
"the realization sent a small thrill down through her entire body ."
"`` if you '' re in this hotel , you '' re doing well so it must be lucrative . ''"
"`` is that all you want ?"
"money ? ''"
"he asked gently ."
"electra laughed , thinking about the bank account that was now into the millions since she hated touching the income from the king ."
"her monthly allowance was blood money , sent each month to absolve a man of his guilt for killing her father ."
"`` it doesn '' t motivate me , if that '' s what you '' re asking . ''"
"`` but you '' re looking for something lucrative as a career choice . ''"
"electra smiled but it was more self-deprecating ."
"`` no , actually , i '' d like to teach ."
"that means that i '' ll never be wealthy in a financial sense . ''"
"he nodded his head , hiding his concern ."
"he didn '' t want this lovely , luscious woman to have principles ."
"it would be that much more difficult to get her to agree to become his mistress ."
"he had preferred the more monetary approach ."
"it was always more straightforward and easy ."
"but he didn '' t back down from the challenge ."
"somehow , the idea that she wanted to teach children only made him want her more ."
"and he always got what he wanted ."
"`` perhaps there is more to life than money , '' he said ."
"`` that '' s what all the teacher '' s i '' ve spoken to have said ."
"they are in it for the success of their students and the achievement in helping each of them learn something new ."
"monetary rewards are way down the list . ''"
"he raised an eye at her response ."
"`` doesn '' t that daunt you away from the career ? ''"
"she tilted her head to the side as she responded ."
"`` no ."
"in fact , the more i talk to teachers who work in the field , the more i want to teach . ''"
"`` you seem very passionate about the idea , '' he said and his awareness of the woman increased when he saw her eyes flare with his words ."
"good , she wanted him ."
"the idea was never in doubt ."
"women never turned him down ."
"he wasn '' t vain , he just knew that the power of his title and his enormous wealth were a powerful aphrodisiac ."
"he didn '' t consider himself all that tough on the eyes either ."
"`` yes ."
"i '' m passionate , '' she said , leaving it at that without any further explanation ."
"let him take her statement as he wanted to ."
"`` what else are you passionate about ? ''"
"he asked , rising to the bait ."
"electra stifled a giggle ."
"this was her first attempt at seduction and she didn '' t want to blow it ."
"perhaps this one man , with his toughness and aura of danger and mystery , would ignore the intimidation tactics of micha , jamil and gerrard ."
"instead of stating the obvious , she bit her lower lip enticingly , looked up at the ceiling for a moment , then glanced back down at him ."
"`` romans , '' she said emphatically ."
"she was glad to see him blink , surprised at her answer ."
"`` romans ? ''"
"he repeated , obviously caught off-guard ."
"`` yes ."
"i love roman history ."
"greek history is also amazing but i love roman history the best ."
"the gods and goddesses , the wars , the conquering heroes , the passion of the people for learning and all the horrible and amazing discoveries and inventions that came out of that period simply inspire me . ''"
"the slow smile that spread across his mouth made her breath catch in her throat ."
"and when he started to discuss the various greek and roman gods and goddesses with her and their contributions and impacts on today '' s world , she could barely contain her enthusiasm ."
"she had no concept of the passing of time , only of this man and the incredible amount of knowledge he held inside of him ."
"he presented ideas she '' d never considered about history and he made her mind scramble to keep up with him ."
"she was challenged as she '' d never been in her dry university classes and she was more thrilled than she could ever imagine being ."
"when a gray suited man slipped a note to her companion , she glanced down at her watch and gasped ."
"`` oh , no !"
"is it really already passed two o '' clock ? ''"
"she gasped ."
"her appointment with her guardian had been over an hour ago ."
"`` i have to go , '' she said and quickly stood up , grabbing her purse , forgetting the list of job openings by her chair ."
"sticking out her hand , she offered it in a half hearted attempt at the social niceties , but her mind was already on an argument to present to her guardian for her unforgivable tardiness for their meeting ."
"it had taken over a year to manage getting this appointment ."
"how long would it be before she could wrangle another one into his painfully busy schedule ."
"`` thank you for a great afternoon but i must go , '' she said and almost pulled her hand back when he didn '' t immediately take it in his ."
"but his warm , strong fingers wrapped around her smaller one and all her panic disappeared ."
"the rest of the world receded and she looked up , and up again , into the man '' s dangerous eyes ."
"she couldn '' t pull her hand away , and now , she didn '' t want to ."
"her whole body had forgotten her missed meeting and was now focused on her previous intent of seducing this man , having him initiate her into the world of love making ."
"her hand tingled and her body seemed to be shaking and he wasn '' t touching anything but her fingers with one hand and her wrist with the other ."
"`` have dinner with me tonight , '' he said and she heard the order in his voice ."
"it wasn '' t a question , it was a command ."
"she suspected this man was always obeyed and a part of her , the rebellious side that had fought almost constantly against her protectors for the first several years , rose up and started to say no simply because it was an order instead of a request ."
"but the side of her that was intrigued beyond measure by the man '' s touch , his gaze , the promise behind his eyes , overrode her rebellion and accepted his command ."
"`` yes , '' she replied ."
"`` good ."
"give me your address and i '' ll have a car pick you up , '' he said ."
"electra floundered ."
"he couldn '' t show up at her place , the guards would follow and she was hoping , just this once , she could outsmart them and be alone tonight ."
"sure , dharr was strong enough and confident enough that he probably wouldn '' t be intimidated ."
"but did she want to take that chance ?"
"glancing down at the man '' s magnificent physique , she knew the answer was no ."
"this was her chance at a glorious introduction and she was going to take it ."
"`` um ... '' she thought quickly ."
"`` how about if i meet you somewhere ? ''"
"she suggested ."
"maybe the old bathroom trick would work this time ."
"she hasn '' t tried to slip away from her guards in years ."
"maybe they were lulled into a false sense of security ."
"everything inside dharr fought against releasing control of this situation and this slender beauty ."
"if she would give him her address , he would know how to move forward , could have her investigated and find out her strengths and weaknesses ."
"he was more determined than ever to have this woman in his bed ."
"what was more intriguing than just his sexual desire for her , he wanted to learn all about her personally ."
"that was definitely a first ."
"so far , he knew several things ."
"she hated her coffee black but hewasn '' t sure why she drank it that way , she loved history , she had a rebellious streak that would be exciting to tame and she was physically attracted to him ."
"usually , this was more than he knew of his other mistresses and he preferred it that way ."
"this would be a different situation on many levels , he suspected ."
"`` give me your address , ellie ."
"i '' ll send a car for you , '' he said and moved closer , a hand reaching out to touch her elbow and his shoulders blocked off the rest of the room ."
"he wanted all of her attention focused on him ."
"electra looked up at him , sure the desire she felt for him was evident in her eyes but unable to control it , this overwhelming feeling being new to her ."
"`` i can '' t give you my address . ''"
"she pulled an old receipt from her wallet and a pen , then wrote down her cell phonenumber ."
"`` here ."
"tell me where to meet you and what time and i '' ll be there ."
"i '' m sorry , '' she said , genuine regret emanating from her eyes as she took a step back , `` i must go ."
"i '' m very late for an important meeting . ''"
"dharr watched as she walked through the restaurant , his body reacting to the gentle sway of her hips as she weaved through the tables ."
"he felt more than he saw , his aide standing next to him ."
"handing the receipt to him he said , `` find out who owns this cell phone number quickly and get all the information on her ."
"her first name is ellie . ''"
"`` and her last name ? ''"
"jamil said , his pen hesitating above the piece of paper ."
"dharr cursed under his breath ."
"`` i don '' t know , '' he said viciously , his eyes still watching as she walked out of the hotel lobby , already talking on the cell phone ."
"how could he have forgotten to get her last name ?"
"`` i don '' t know ."
"find out for me . ''"
"the man nodded and wrote down some information before looking back up at him ."
"`` perhaps i have some good news , your highness . ''"
"dharr walked out of the hotel , impatient to move on to the rest of his meetings so he could relax for the evening ."
"his mind was already planning her seduction and he only allowed half his mind to listen to jamil while the more important half was slowly stripping the sexy woman '' s clothes off her body ."
"`` what '' s that ? ''"
"he asked impatiently , stepping into the waiting limousine , completely unaware of the body guards slipping into the front seat and into the black suvs in front of and behind the limousine ."
"`` ms. knight apparently did not show up for her appointment with you , '' jamil said , aware that his boss '' s mind was not focused on the present ."
"although he wasn '' t sure what it could be focused on , which confused the aide ."
"his employer was extremely conscientious of his duties and never let his personal life interfere with more important priorities ."
"there had only been the one woman for the past hour , so what could be breaking his attention ?"
"king abbas would never let his concentration slip for a mere woman , jamil thought to himself ."
"but his aide was incorrect ."
"dharr '' s mind was picturing her in a red thong and red lace bra ."
"no , he changed his mind , knowing that the woman didn '' t seem right wearing red ."
"pink ?"
"no , too soft ."
"although she '' d worn a pink suit today , he doubted she '' d wear pink underwear ."
"she would probably consider that color a weakness ."
"black ?"
"did she have that kind of courage ?"
"he hoped so ."
"`` yes , sire ."
"we tried calling her house but her grandmother said she '' d left for your meeting with plenty of time ."
"having received that information , we called her guards who assured me that she '' d shown up for the meeting ."
"it seemed odd , their response . ''"
"dharr didn '' t care what was odd about the irritating ward so he didn '' t reply ."
"blue ?"
"perhaps ."
"yes , the more he considered it , he suspected she '' d wear blue ."
"it would look perfect with her long hair tangling across his pillow , high heels and a garter belt ."
"he '' d leave those on , he thought ."
"but nothing else ."
"`` inform the chef i '' ll be having a guest for dinner , '' he said , his body hardening with the mental image he '' d formed in his mind ."
"chapter 3 electra dialed the number one more time , praying she '' d reach someone this time ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"she said when an efficient sounding gentleman answered the phone ."
"`` yes , this is electra knight ."
"i was supposed to meet with king abbas this afternoon , '' she explained , her whole body tense as she waited for the response ."
"when there was none , she continued on ."
"`` well , anyway , i '' m afraid something came up and i was unable to make that appointment ."
"when would be the next available time ? ''"
"she asked , holding her breath as she waited for a time slot a year in advance ."
"please let it be sooner , she prayed ."
"she was horrified by the response ."
"the man '' s schedule was booked up completely for the foreseeable future ?"
"`` never ?"
"i '' m sorry , that '' s just not possible ."
"either i have to speak with the man or you have to pull these guards off my duty , '' she demanded , her whole body tensing with the answer ."
"`` that '' s not possible !"
"please , just give him the message that i called and tell him i '' ll meet him anywhere in the world at his convenience ."
"it doesn '' t have to be london ."
"i '' ll even be on standby for him somewhere . ''"
"she waited , fighting the tears that threatened to drop over her la shes ."
"`` you '' ll consult his calendar ? ''"
"she repeated ."
"`` that '' s fine ."
"please ... thank you very much ."
"i promise , i won '' t miss the next meeting , no matter where or when , '' she said ."
"she smiled tentatively as gerrard got into the car beside her and fastened his seat belt ."
"she didn '' t want to talk to him , being the least favorite of her guards , but she didn '' t want to create any suspicions about her evening plans ."
"`` i have to go shopping , '' she said , thinking about the possible stores she would investigate ."
"she had to find the perfect outfit for tonight ."
"something that shouted `` sophisticated '' but nothing garish ."
"she almost smiled at the memory of their conversation regarding her career ."
"a prostitute !"
"good grief , what had she been thinking ?"
"as usual , gerrard said nothing but for the rest of the afternoon , he followed her through several stores , standing outside the dressing rooms as she tried on clothes ."
"she was no longer embarrassed by him , or one of the other two guards , being stationed so close and she even had the ability to laugh at the reactions of some of the store owners ."
"this time , she was too busy trying to find something sophisticated to wear for her dinner with dharr to concern herself with anyone '' s reaction , even gerrard '' s. she heard him talk on his cell phone once or twice , but since he spoke in arabic , she had no idea what he was discussing ."
"as she picked up a simple black dress , she absently thought that it might have been a good idea to have learned arabic ."
"but it never interested her , probably a throwback to her silly rebellion ."
"she didn '' t want to have anything in common with that irritating king what '' s-his-name ."
"learning his language might have given him too much in their battle of wills , even if he never knew that she '' d acquired the skill ."
"well , her battle of will ."
"he probably didn '' t know she existed ."
"in the fifth shop , she found exactly what she was looking for ."
"the strapless green cocktail dress fit straight across her breasts with a pretty silver , beaded scalloped edge ."
"the rest of the dress hugged her figure all the way down to her knees ."
"the look suggested sophistication and invitation ."
"exactly the right message , she thought ."
"she found the perfect pair of sandals that gave her added height which , in her mind , translated into confidence ."
"biting her lower lip as she looked at her reflection in the mirror , she considered buying pretty new underwear ."
"the dress required a strapless bra so it was pretty much a given if she was going to buy this dress ."
"shrugging her shoulders , she pushed the fact that gerrard would have to follow her into the lingerie store to the back of her mind ."
"if he wanted to follow her in , he '' d have to deal with the issue himself ."
"she didn '' t want him there , so he could stand outside if he was too uncomfortable ."
"she quickly changed back into her own clothes and purchased the dress , then strolled down the street until she came to the perfect store ."
"smiling with delight , she opened the store door and started inside ."
"she was almost through the door when she felt the firm hand on her arm ."
"glancing upwards , she saw the shocked expression on gerrard '' s face ."
"`` you can '' t go in there , '' he said , horror etching every inch of his face ."
"he might be her least favorite , but he was still a very nice gentleman ."
"she felt a small amount of guilt at what she was putting the man through but pushed that to the back of her mind and shook her head ."
"`` i need to buy something in here ."
"you can either stand outside or come in ."
"it is up to you , '' she said as confidently as she could , daring the man to stop her ."
"the indecision was obvious and he struggled for several seconds before he managed to shake his head ."
"`` no ."
"there '' s nothing in this store that you need , '' he said firmly ."
"electralaughed ."
"`` yes ."
"there definitely is , '' she said and slipped out of his grasp before he could say anything else ."
"walking quickly through the store , she headed for the back , determined to avoid gerrard '' s furious gaze and the probable humiliation when he worked up the nerve to follow her into the store and drag her out ."
"luckily , she quickly found exactly what she needed and made her purchase ."
"walking out , she smiled brightly at a glaring gerrard , acting as if nothing was amiss ."
"which , in her mind , there wasn '' t although she knew he didn '' t see it quite the same way ."
"she was just getting into her car when her cell phone rang ."
"looking at the number , her heart froze , then went into overdrive when she realized that this was an unknown number ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"she answered the phone with as much co nfidence as her racing heart would allow ."
"unfortunately , it wasn '' t dharr but one of his aides , giving her directions to dharr '' s address ."
"she wrote down the time and address with both terror and excitement ."
"this was it , she thought as she hung up the phone ."
"she could do this , she told herself and took a long , deep breath ."
"`` i '' m going to this address tonight , '' she said , handing the piece of paper to gerrard defiantly ."
"`` and you '' re not coming in . ''"
"gerrard looked at the address , then nodded ."
"`` fine , '' handing the piece of paper back to her without looking at her face ."
"there was a grim look on his face she hadn '' t ever seen before ."
"as electra drove the car home , she reflected what she '' d seen in his expression , not sure how exactly to describe it ."
"it bothered her , but as soon as she walked into the house , the excitement of the upcoming evening overrode every other consideration ."
"she showered , then pulled her hair up on top of her head in a sophisticated twist ."
"pulling on her new dress , she surveyed her reflection in the mirror as she fastened dangling earrings to her ears ."
"they were not real diamonds , but who would ever know ?"
"cubic zirconium were great fakes , she told herself ."
"walking into the lobby of the luxurious apartment complex , she smiled tremulously to the doorman ."
"micha followed slightly behind her but he held back when she stepped into the elevators ."
"she didn '' t understand why , this night of all nights , he was willing to leave her alone ."
"maybe the wealth of the building or perhaps it was the way she was dressed , obviously ready for her evening liaison ."
"whatever the reason , she was thrilled when the elevator doors closed with her alone ."
"a shiver of anticipation traveled through her body and she could hardly wait to see dharr once again ."
"had it only been six hours , she wondered ?"
"it seemed like weeks since she '' d left him in the hotel restaurant ."
"the elevator doors opened and , instead of a hallway filled with different doors , she found herself stepping into an opulently decorated foyer ."
"the elevator was obviously a private one that led directly to what appeared to be the penthouse of the building ."
"electra was struck by the view of london laid out in front of her through the floor to ceiling windows ."
"she was still standing there , looking stunned and feeling extremely nervous when a deep voice chuckled ."
"`` i know the view is nice , but i didn '' t know it would stun people to immobility ."
"at least , it never has before , '' he explained and moved forward , reaching out to lift her hand to his mouth ."
"she shivered again when his mouth touched her fingers ."
"but that was nothing compared to the feeling of desire that sparked through her body when he turned her hand over and kissed the soft side of her wrist , his knowing eyes taking in the frantic beat of her heart against her skin ."
"`` it is hard to believe but you look more beautiful than this afternoon , '' he said , looking down into her green eyes ."
"electra neededto take a deep breath but her lungs wouldn '' t cooperate ."
"they could only pull in small gasps of air as her eyes adjusted to the lower lighting and the immense power of his presence ."
"`` that '' s an invitation i simply can '' t refuse , '' he said , referring to her slightly open mouth ."
"he bent down and gently caressed her lips with his ."
"it was only a brief kiss but since it was electra '' s first , she could not contain the surprise in her eyes or the shiver of amazement at how wonderful the feeling was ."
"breathing in a deep , shuddering breath , her eyes still closed , she whispered , `` would you please do that again ? ''"
"she heard the `` with pleasure , '' response but couldn '' t think beyond his mouth , his lips , the feel of muscles underneath his tailored suit as her fingers touched his chest to steady her swaying body ."
"the feelings were wonderful and intense and unlike anything she could have imagined ."
"the sweet desire coursed through her , leaving her weak and defenseless , aching for more as her body stepped closer to his ."
"when she felt his hard planes against her softer ones , she couldn '' t stop the sigh of pleasure that escaped her mouth only to be captured by his own as he covered her mouth once again , this time with more feeling , more passion , his tongue invading , demanding that her own mate with his as his hands slid down her back , pulling her hips so they were flush with his own ."
"electra gasped when she felt his erection against her stomach but it only took her a moment of fear before the desire intensified ."
"her hand slid up the wool of his suit to dive into the silk of his hair , her fingers touching his hair , his neck , his ears , anything that she could , needing to feel more of him ."
"finally , he pulled his head away and electra almost cried out at the absence of his lips on hers ."
"her eyes looked up to his , questioning why he had stopped something that seemed to be absolutely perfect ."
"his chuckle was like a bucket of cold water on her rampaging desire but his words soothed her worried mind ."
"`` that '' s the best greeting i '' ve had all day . ''"
"he stepped back and took her hand in his , guiding her into thepenthouse ."
"`` how was your afternoon ? ''"
"he asked , leading her out onto the terrace that was covered with trees and flowers in both pots and seeming to be planted in the ground ."
"looking around , the terrace looked like a regular garden ."
"if it weren '' t for the lights of london twinkling down beneath them , one would never know that they were more than fifty stories above the street ."
"`` my afternoon was exciting but only because i was waiting for your call ."
"thanks for breaking through the mundane , '' she smiled up at him ."
"`` did you fix your meeting ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra grimaced ."
"`` no ."
"but i '' ll get it straightened out soon enough , '' she said , her voice determined and emphatic ."
"`` what was the meeting about ? ''"
"he asked as he led her through the subtly lit trees and shrubs of the roof garden ."
"electra waved her hand airily , `` nothing too important ."
"just someone i was trying to convince to back off , '' she said ."
"he stopped and turned her toward him ."
"`` is there something i can do to help ? ''"
"he asked , his eyes hard andunyielding ."
"`` if someone is bothering you , i want to know about it . ''"
"he didn '' t question the reason why he would interfere in a situation regarding someone he '' d met only six hours ago ."
"this woman was different and he couldn '' t figure her out ."
"until he did , he wanted all of her attention on him so he could get to the bottom of the mystery ."
"even her kiss was intriguing ."
"initially , he would have sworn that she was inexperienced , but the way she '' d stepped forward , melting into him and mimicking every movement he made showed that she was much more experienced than he '' d initially thought ."
"just the memory of their kiss and the way she '' d felt , fitting so perfectly into him and her body yielding to his , made him throb in areas he '' d always had control of before ."
"he pushed the desire to the back of his mind , enjoying the pain , using it to add focus to the night ."
"anticipation was more than half the reward , wasn '' t it ?"
"women , after the first encounter , turned predictable and mundane , he found ."
"he planned on spreading this feeling of anticipation out for the whole night , enjoying the feeling of conquer and control ."
"electra shied away from him ever knowing about her circumstances ."
"she wanted to be normal and telling him she was the ward of a king would not be a normal issue ."
"`` no , don '' t worry about this ."
"it '' s nothing i can '' t handle , '' she said and moved away from him to lift a soft , white flower to her nose ."
"`` this smells wonderful ."
"what is it ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he allowed the subject change , simply because her movements pulled her dress tighter across her derriere and allowed him a better view of a very nice part of her anatomy ."
"`` gardenia ? ''"
"he suggested , unsure of the flora and fauna of this region ."
"`` i have no idea , '' he said softly , his eyes not even looking at the flower but more on the expression of joy on her lovely face ."
"electra laughed softly and shook her head , unaware of the impact her laughter had on her companion ."
"she didn '' t glance back or she '' d have caught the expression of intensity on his face ."
"she might have run from the penthouse ."
"but then again , she might have slipped the zipper down on her dress and enticed him to finish what he '' d started at the doorway ."
"her body was so tense , so primed for more of his touch , his kisses , that she felt like a bow that was being pulled tighter and tighter ."
"`` no , this isn '' t a usual gardenia ."
"i '' ve seen them in other places and would recognize them ."
"this is something special , '' she said and moved toward the next flower , trying to distract herself from the man standing behind her ."
"she had to do something with her hands besides reach up and loosen his tie ."
"good grief , she was considering all the different ways she could cut the man '' s suit off of him ."
"she had to get a grip on herself ."
"`` this is a pretty rose , '' she said , her fingers caressing the petals gently , unknowingly sensuous as her fingers trailed down to the ends of the delicate flower ."
"`` you like to garden ? ''"
"he asked , following her as she moved from one plant to the next , his eyes watching her hands hungrily ."
"each time she touched another plant or flower , he thought of how he would make her do the same to him , to specific parts of his anatomy ."
"her fingers were long , slender and delicate and for the first time since he '' d been initiated into the world of sexuality , he had to grit his teeth as the desire stormed through his body , almost uncontrollable in its intensity ."
"electra grimaced and moved on to the next lovely , delicate bloom ."
"`` no ."
"i '' m not very good at keeping things alive , '' she said , her laughing gaze turning back to his as she spoke softly ."
"`` i prefer strolling through the botanical gardens or nurseries , pretending i have a green thumb . ''"
"`` why the interest in plants ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she turned and smiled brightly at him ."
"`` just because i can '' t grow them , doesn '' t mean i don '' t appreciate their beauty and scent ."
"the complexity of the flowers never ceases to amaze me , '' she said and turned back to walk further along the pathway ."
"`` i mean , have you ever really looked at a plant ?"
"the perfect shape of the petals that are designed to encourage and entice bees and other bugs to rest and take their nectar ."
"each bloom has a particular insect that it is trying to entice and all parts of the flower are specifically created for only that insect ."
"it '' s amazing , '' she said , unknowingly enticing him further with her talk of the sexuality of the botanical world ."
"`` what can i get you to drink ? ''"
"he asked abruptly , walking ahead of her toward an open area that contained a table laid with white linen and candles along with a bar to one side ."
"electra followed , a little surprised and hurt by his angry tone but tried to breeze through the moment ."
"perhaps he just wasn '' t interested in flowers and she was boring him with her silly talk ."
"biting her lip in confusion , she leaned against the bar and looked around at the various bottles available ."
"unfortunately , she didn '' t drink very often so she had no idea what sophisticated women would request ."
"`` i '' ll have whatever you '' re having , '' she replied , hoping whatever he drank wouldn '' t taste too awful ."
"standing behind the bar , he thought he had his libido more under control ."
"at her answer , he grinned at her wolfishly ."
"`` will you always be so amenable to my preferences ? ''"
"he teased ."
"electra stared at him , not sure what happened but he was suddenly the same man he '' d been when she '' d walked through the door ."
"what happened to the man who had almost stomped away from her only moments ago ?"
"shaking her head slightly , she eased into one of the tall chairs and leaned onto the bar ."
"`` depends on what you '' re suggesting , '' she replied ."
"they were getting into dangerous territorybut she didn '' t want to back down , her heart rate speeding up and her breath coming in quick , short gasps ."
"she was afraid she might be promising him something unknowinglybut felt sure he '' d never pressure her into anything she felt uncomfortable with ."
"`` ah , a woman with conditions , '' he said , shaking his head as he poured several liquids into a shaker , then tossed ice cubes in ."
"`` all my hopes are dashed . ''"
"electra laughed ."
"`` you seem like the kind of man who needs to be disappointed every once in a while , '' she countered ."
"`` i suspect you get your way too often . ''"
"one eyebrow raised teasingly he said , `` are you going to be the one to take me down a peg ? ''"
"he suggested ."
"her mouth dried up with his suggestion but she couldn '' t even go on teasing any longer ."
"`` no ."
"i '' m afraid i '' m not going to be that woman , '' she said ."
"his eyes caught hers and held her with their intensity ."
"`` good , '' he finally said ."
"he then broke the connection and handed her a martini ."
"raising his glass to hers , he said , `` to a lack of disappointment , '' he said and touched her glass gently ."
"after taking a sip of the dry martini , he said , `` so what did you do today besides try and fix your missed appointment ? ''"
"instead of standing behind the bar as she '' d expected , he came around to the front of the bar and sat down beside her ."
"electra hid her disappointment when he didn '' t immediately take her into his arms and carry her off to his bed ."
"good grief , she '' d be happy if he '' d take her right here on the soft grass beneath the chair , she thought , shivering in anticipation at the thought ."
"trying to think of what she '' d done , she shook her head when she came up blank ."
"`` i shopped for this dress , '' she said and held out her arms to show him the dress ."
"his eyes flared instantly as he looked down at her voluptuous breasts contained in the glittering green material ."
"`` very nice , '' he said ."
"`` and what else ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra shook her head and laughed ."
"`` i '' m not sure you understand how difficult it is to find a dress for an evening with a man like you ."
"shopping took up all my afternoon , except for the portion in which i was getting into the dress , '' she explained , her eyes twinkling at his curious expression ."
"he smiled back at her ."
"`` that is an occupation i hope to encourage , '' he said and took a sip of his own martini ."
"`` were you able to fix your meeting ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` no ."
"the odious man wouldn '' t even return my phone calls ."
"one of his aides was screening all his callsalthough i '' m pretty sure i have the man '' s personal cell phone . ''"
"`` perhaps i could help with your mission if you '' d care to explain it to me ."
"i have many connections ."
"maybe i could reach this person for you . ''"
"electra shook her head sadly ."
"`` thank you ve ry much for the offer but this is something i have to do on my own , '' she said , not willing to go into the reasons for that ."
"`` what did you do this afternoon ? ''"
"`` met with boring , pompous men who tried to sell me things , '' he replied ."
"`` what kinds of things ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` buildings , '' he answered ."
"electra almost chocked on her martini ."
"she had to cough and take a deep breath before she could reply ."
"`` did you say building ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he pulled his hand away that had been patting her back and smiled down into her stunned face ."
"he wasn '' t bragging but this was a normal part of his life and hadn '' t thought anything of it before he '' d opened up about his afternoon meetings ."
"he hesitated for only a second with the realization that he '' d never discussed his life with any other woman before ."
"in his mind , women were a pleasant diversion but nothing more and certainly not part of his business world ."
"why had he said something like that to this one ?"
"and why was he going to continue to give her insight into his world ?"
"`` plural actually ."
"a conglomerate is hoping to entice me into buying a packet of land and , in addition , they want me to build several sky scrapers on it . ''"
"electra nodded sagely , as if she understood ."
"but the idea of someone building sky scrapers , much less buying the land and more than one building , simply boggled her mind ."
"`` well , of course , '' she replied ."
"`` why not go for the volume discounts , '' she teased , still gasping slightly from the alcohol going down the wrong way ."
"she fanned her face in the hopes that her embarrassment wouldn '' t show ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"he laughed with her ."
"`` so , what exactly do you do ?"
"are you some sort of property developer ? ''"
"she asked , afraid that whatever he might reply would put him way out of her league ."
"she didn '' t want him to be that wealthy although this penthouse certainly screamed immense wealth ."
"`` i do many things , '' he said ambiguously ."
"he didn '' t want to reveal his identity to this woman for some reason ."
"too many times , he '' d been desired for his wealth or his title ."
"he wanted to be desired for himself ."
"why he cared in this instance was beyond him but he did and he wasn '' t going to question it at this point ."
"once he '' d worked her out of his system and moved on to the next woman , he didn '' t care if she found out about him ."
"but he '' d do all he could to keep her from learning of his real identity until that point arrived ."
"`` such as ? ''"
"she encouraged ."
"`` think of ways to get you here tonight , '' he replied ."
"electra blushed ."
"she suspected that he '' d meant to say `` into my bed '' but he '' d held back at the last moment ."
"if he '' d said those words , she '' d probably have stood up and started stripping right there and then , needing him so much she thought she might burst into flames at any moment ."
"but she held back , sipping her martini in the hope that it might cool down her desire somehow ."
"something off to the side caught his attention and he nodded ."
"`` are you ready for dinner ? ''"
"he asked and stood up ."
"electra stood herself and turned in the direction of his nod , gasping when she caught three men in white chef uniforms with trays walking onto the terrace ."
"they placed a plate in front of each chair at the table , then another in the center ."
"one whipped out a lighter and lit the candles then , just as quickly as they '' d appeared , all three of them disappeared into the forest of trees and shrubs ."
"`` who was that ? ''"
"she asked , her mouth hanging open in shock and her eyes wide ."
"`` who was what ? ''"
"he asked , walking over to the table to hold out a chair for her ."
"`` those men , '' she replied , w alking carefully over to the table , not sure her legs would carry her ."
"the martini was more than half gone by now and she suspected that it was too potent for her ."
"she didn '' t usually drink so she was feeling the effects of the alcohol quickly ."
"she reached for the glass of ice water , drinking the liquid thirstily ."
"`` the chefs ? ''"
"he asked , sitting down on the opposite side of her and picking up a bottle of wine , pouring the rich , red liquid into their two glasses ."
"`` you have more than one ? ''"
"she asked ."
"dharr shrugged ."
"`` i don '' t know what their official titles are ."
"i suspect that one of them is a lead chef and the other two sous chefs , '' he theorized ."
"`` do they bother you ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra shook her head and drank more water then pulled her napkin down onto her lap ."
"anything to keep her hands busy ."
"dharr understood that something had happened to make her feel uncomfortable so for the next hour , he worked on putting her at ease again ."
"he told her silly stories from his childhood , asked her about her own , about her education , her dreams for the future and basically pulling out as much information as he could from her ."
"the whole time though , he was watching her animated face , noting that every emotion played out in her eyes and in her expressions ."
"she spoke with her hands and he had a hard time keeping his eyes on her face since , each time she moved her hands , the low cut of her dress brought his attention to her breasts , their softness enticing him , entrancing him ."
"when the dessert was over , she laid her fork down on the side of her plate , her nervousness intensifying ."
"the meal was over and she had nothing else to talk about ."
"all she wanted to do was make love with this man and experience the magic she was sure he could give her with his touch ."
"but he looked relaxed and not about to initiate anything more than conversation ."
"at some point , music had started playing and had grown louder as the meal progressed ."
"between the wine , the candles , the soft music and dharr '' s magnetic personality , she could actually feel the sexual vibrations bouncing between them ."
"taking her glass of wine and standing up , she walked over to the side of the terrace , looking out over the horizon and wondering how she could get him to put his arms around her ."
"she was so nervous but still determined to be with him tonight ."
"she wanted this man and she had the relative freedom to be with him although she was sure that micha was sitting downstairs in the lobby of the building waiting for her ."
"when she felt his arms come around her waist , his chin nuzzle the nape of her neck , she sighed with pleasure and relief.she hadn '' t come up with a way to entice him so him taking the lead was a relief ."
"the kisses that trailed down her neck and across her shoulder felt splendid but when his fingers slid across the back of her dress , she shivered in delight , her back arching and her mouth opening slightly ."
"`` you have a beautiful back , ellie . ''"
"he ran his tongue along the shell of her ear , then nibbled on the lobe ."
"`` but you should have real diamonds here instead of these , '' he said and wrapped his hand around her waist , pulling her back against his front ."
"electra gasped at the sensations and wanted to turn around , face him and kiss him but he held her firmly with one hand , while the other reached up and let his fingers skim across the top of the dress , just as his fingers had done to the back only moments ago ."
"`` your skin is like satin , '' he whispered ."
"`` but your hair should never be tied up like this , '' he said , releasing her body so his fingers could slid into the long tresses , sending the pins flying in every direction ."
"she didn '' t care where they went , as long as his hands continued to caress her scalp ."
"when his hands tangled in her long , black hair , she wanted to melt against him ."
"she pushed her back more firmly against him , feeling his erection against her back ."
"her hands reached out behind her , coming into contact with his hard , muscular thighs , amazed at the strength she found there ."
"`` dharr , '' she whispered , unable to con tinue with her words although she would have begged him to hurry , to carry her away and ease this aching , almost painful burning that had taken over every cell in her body ."
"`` what do you want ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` you ."
"i want you , '' she said firmly , her fingers skimming along his slacks ."
"she wanted to go higher , to turn around and wrap her fingers around the length of his erection and explore the manbut she didn '' t have the courage ."
"when he spun her around himself and covered her mouth with his , she didn '' t argue ."
"in fact , she stood on her toes , eager to receive his kiss and give as much as she got in return ."
"her body melted into his , pushing her breasts against his chest , her hips against his , eager to feel more of him ."
"when he lifted her up into his arms , she almost blurted out , `` finally ! ''"
"but controlled herself by burying her face in his neck , inhaling the male scent of him and teasing the lobe of his ear , just as he '' d done to her a few minutes ago ."
"the room he carried her into was dimly lit so her eyes had no problems adjusting to the light ."
"but her legs barely held her upright when he set her back down on the floor ."
"his fingers easily found the zipper in the back , all the while kissing her , ravishing her mouth with his own ."
"electra felt the whoosh of air against her naked skin and the temporary feel of cold as the air hit her , but then his hands were against her back , her body pulled up against his as his hands covered her bottom , pulling her higher ."
"she pushed his suit jacket off his shoulders , uncaring that the beautiful fabric fell carelessly to the floor ."
"she then struggled with his tie but , never having been around men as she grew up , the knot was a mystery to her ."
"finally , he delicately pulled her hands away and did it himself , tossing it on the floor beside them before pulling her back into his arms ."
"electra worked the buttons of his shirt , eager to see what she '' d been feeling for the past several minutes ."
"was he as solidly built as she suspected ?"
"was he covered with muscles or was it just an illusion ?"
"she heard a ping as one of the buttons popped off and hit the wall somewhere but she didn '' t care ."
"she just moved on to the next , hurriedly needing to get his chest uncovered ."
"her breathing was rapid and her eyes dilated as she finally pulled the fabric away to reveal the chest of a body builder ."
"no , her mind could never have thought up this many muscles under that severe , well tailored suit ."
"no man should cover up something this magnificent , she thought , her fingers traveling down the bulging pectorals , the packed abdominal muscles , tracing the black line that disappeared into his pants ."
"she heard the sharp intake of his breath but paid no attention to it , too fascinated with exploring the treasure she '' d just uncovered ."
"her hands moved higher , her eyes following hungrily as she moved her fingertips along the muscles just revealed ."
"one finger accidentally brushed his nipple and she felt his indrawn breath so she moved back , her hands covering the flat nipple with tremulous exploration ."
"when her fingers lingered , teased and captured it gently , she felt his hands clench and unclench on her waist and her eyes looked up ."
"his own were closed and his jaw tight , as if he were clenching his teeth to control what she made him feel ."
"that kind of power only heightened her own desire and she watched in fascination as her hands traveled up to his shoulders then down across the bulging biceps ."
"while her hands explored , her head moved forward , her tongue gently caressing his nipple with the assumption that , if her fingers felt good , perhaps she could intensify that feeling ."
"as soon as her tongue flicked the sensitive part , she heard him groan and the hands that had been clenching at her waist suddenly grasped her hips , lifting her higher , then tossing her onto the bed ."
"electra smiled , loving the feeling of power but then saw that his huge body was coming down onto hers ."
"her arms reached up to welcome him but he grasped them in one hand , holding them over her head ."
"`` no more , '' he grated out before his mouth covered her own nipple , teasing it through the lace while heat of his tongue createdfeelings that both shocked and terrified her ."
"`` dharr ! ''"
"she cried out , her hips shifting under his weight , her legs moving up , stirring in any way in an attempt to escape the heat but he was now in control and he wasn '' t going to relinquish it again ."
"his mouth moved to the other side , laving that nipple with the same attention , his free hand coming up to tease the flesh above the lace on her strapless bra , the effect more tantalizing than anything she '' d ever imagined ."
"`` please don '' t stop , '' she said , writhing under his light touch ."
"his mouth descended to her nipple as his hand reached behind her and unsnapped the clasp , releasing her breasts from the light constriction ."
"`` don '' t worry ."
"i '' m not planning on it , '' he said , his deep voice now husky as his mouth moved lower , nibbling on her ribs , then moving even lower to her stomach ."
"`` do you like this ? ''"
"he asked as his teeth skimmed the slight swell of her stomach ."
"`` yes ! ''"
"she cried out as his mouth found a sensitive spot near her hip bone ."
"`` yes , '' she sighed as he softly caressed the spot again , then nipped it with his teeth ."
"`` what else ? ''"
"he asked , releasing her hands and moved even lower , his mouth moving to her thigh ."
"as soon as her hands were released from their constraints , they moved into his hair , her fingers clenching and unclenching as he hit one sensitive spot after another ."
"`` i don '' t know , '' she said honestly but her hips were rocking slightly , unsure of what she should be doing but uncaring as the desire ached within her ."
"`` i need you now ! ''"
"she said ."
"his soft chuckle was her only warning as his fingers moved between her thighs ."
"`` patience , '' he said and kissed the inside of her thigh while his fingers moved higher , tantalizing her , her legs opening of their own volition , giving his mouth better access to his goal."
"``"
"dharr ! ''"
"she cried out when his mouth touched her in the most intimate part of her ."
"her fingers , which had been holding his head , initially pulled at his hair but his mouth was relentless and after only a moment , she gasped and arched into his mouth , opening wider as his tongue and mouth found her core , creating sensations she couldn '' t understand ."
"her body was almost singing and within only moments , her first climaxed washed over her , wave after wave rocking her body as her eyes squeezed shut and her voice cried out , her fingers clenching his hair ."
"but it wasn '' t over ."
"as soon as her body subsided from the initial orgasm , his fi ngers moved inside and she felt the feelings increase yet again ."
"the combination of his fingers and his rough tongue , his lips , she was lost to the sensations , unable to think to control , to do anything but let him have complete control of her body ."
"when the second wave finally subsided , electra could barely move , her body completely replete and exhausted ."
"when she felt him move over her , she opened her eyes slightly but didn '' t even have the energy for a full glance ."
"`` thank you , '' she said , trying to catch her breath ."
"her arms reached up to wrap around his shoulders but they were heavy and she couldn '' t do much more than lay them against his warm skin ."
"his laughter was the only warning she had that things were not finished ."
"the sound forced her eyes to look at him warily ."
"`` what ? ''"
"she asked , trying desperately to slow her breathing ."
"in answer , he tore open a packet and sheathed himself with the condom ."
"with a purpose that was unmistakable , he bent and kissed her neck , a knee moving between her legs as his mouth moved down lower , capturing a nipple between his teeth , then soothing it with his tongue ."
"`` no !"
"i can '' t , '' she gasped but her arms tensed and held his head in place , the feelings that had spiraled to unimaginable heights started all over again , taking her body with the increasing crescendo ."
"she felt his erection pressing against her softness , probing gently but with more force and her body instantly relaxed to accommodate his size ."
"her breathing increased and her eyes closed , afraid that his perceptive gaze would see the truth ."
"her hands held his shoulders as her body braced for the invasion , the pain ."
"but as he slid deeper inside her , she was surprised to feel a fullness , a completeness ."
"it was wonderful !"
"more than wonderful !"
"she opened her eyes and smiled into him , forcing herself to relax as he struggled , his shoulders and forehead glazed with sweat ."
"she wrapped her legs around his waist , arching into him , her smile encouraging him to continue ."
"with that simple gesture , dharr moved forward , hesitated , then broke through her barrier and stopped , fully enclosed within her but shock breaking out on his face as he looked down at the woman in his arms ."
"if he hadn '' t been watching her the whole time , he would have missed the slight cringe cross her face."
"``"
"ellie ? ''"
"he said , stilling inside of her but his whole body was clamoring for release ."
"was she a virgin ?"
"impossible ."
"she was too bold , too sensuous and much too beautiful for her to have remained untouched at her age ."
"but the tear that touched the edge of her eye proved that she in fact was a virgin ."
"or had been , he realized , cursing himself for being too aggressive ."
"he should have slowed down and found out more about her ."
"her eyes opened and her hands reached out to smooththe worry in his eyes ."
"`` thank you , '' she said as if that were the end ."
"`` thank you ? ''"
"he growled ."
"she thought this was the end ?"
"tossing his head backwards , he stared at a space beyond the bed , searching for the strength to go slowly , to make this an incredible experience for her ."
"he '' d foolishly taken her virginity , the least he could do was make this the best experience possible ."
"his eyes moved back to her face and carefully , slowly moved slightly ."
"when her eyes widened in shock , he breathed easier ."
"the expression didn '' t look like one of pain or anguish but more of curiosity ."
"still not the reaction he was looking for so he moved again , a little longer this time ."
"there it was , he thought and moved again , her expression turning away from curiosity and he captured her gasp of pleasure in his mouth as he continued to move in her , raising her hips slightly and rocking her back and forth ."
"it didn '' t take long before she was moving on her own , her body taking over as her third climax built up ."
"when her muscles contracted around him , he released his own body , allowing himself to find his climax , holding her close and it was more mind-blowing than he could have imagined ."
"as her breathing and heart rate slowed , electra slowly opened her eyes and looked around , surprised to find that the world was still in normal colors ."
"surely after that kind of experience , the world had changed to neon or something just as electrifying and momentous ."
"one by one , she unclenched her fingers , her arms falling to the bed beside her and tried to calm her breathing ."
"maintaining her gaze at a point beyond his shoulder , she tried to act as if this were nothing more than usual for her ."
"but he was not believing her ."
"he rolled over , pulling her along with him so they were still intimately connected but she was now laying on top of him ."
"`` ellie , explain yourself , '' he demanded in a tone that wouldn '' t brook any argument ."
"but that tone wouldn '' t work with her ."
"her rebellious nature reasserting itself ."
"instead of talking , she lifted herself up on her elbows and looked down at the arrogant man underneath her ."
"`` what would you like me to explain ? ''"
"she asked , her fingers teasing the hair on his chest and her lips finding the nipple again ."
"his hand clamped over her fingers and his other pulled her chin up so she couldn '' t tease him ."
"but that left her hands free and she made good use of them ."
"`` dharr , i really don '' t want to talk right now , '' she said , knowing that this was her only night of freedom and she didn '' t want to waste it on silly explanations that would lead to revelations that were pointless ."
"`` i think we need to talk , '' he replied and grabbed her hands but it was too late ."
"she could feel his erection still inside her ."
"she moved her hips slightly and gasped with the feelings that rippled through her ."
"she moved a little more and the feelings intensified ."
"biting her lip , she pushed herself up on his chest so she was straddling him , her teeth biting her lower lip as she moved up , then down , her mouth falling open with the pleasure ."
"`` that feels wonderful , '' she said and smiled a sensuous , knowing smile as her eyes glazed over ."
"looking down at him , she felt wonderful and could tell that he was struggling to stop her movements ."
"`` i '' m not sure why you want to talk , dharr , but couldn '' t we discuss whatever is bothering you a little later ? ''"
"she asked , her hips rocking slightly as she experimented with this new position and all these new feelings ."
"dharr was no match for her budding passion ."
"her body was clenching his own , her strong , slender legs straddling him felt incredible and in the end , he simply allowed her the chance to move however she pleased ."
"no matter how she moved , it definitely pleased him ."
"she was too tight , too wet and he simply couldn '' t slow down the pleasure she was building inside him ."
"she felt his hands on her hips and quickly moved again , hoping he was feeling the same thing she was but afraid he was going to stop her ."
"instead , he pulled her all the way down and she cried out as she was fully sheathed on his erection , feeling the sensation all the way to her core ."
"placing her hands on his chest , she moved again and again , twisting slightly , her hair falling forward as she figured out a rhythm that gave her the most feeling , the most satisfaction ."
"in the end , the passion was too much for her to control since everything was too new for her ."
"he rolled her onto her back again and took over , his body showing her how to gain the most for each thrust and within moments , electra cried out as she climaxed once again , dharr quickly following her ."
"this time , he rolled onto his back as both of them tried to gasp for air ."
"curling onto her side , she watched him ."
"one hand was over his eyes and there was a strain around his mouth ."
"she wanted to reach out to him butwasn '' t sure about his mood ."
"`` dharr ? ''"
"she called out softly , fear that she '' d done something to hurt him or offend him translating in her tone ."
"instantly , his arm came down and he rolled back to her , placing an elbow on each side of her as he looked down into her eyes ."
"`` why didn '' t you warn me ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"`` warn you about what ? ''"
"she asked , pushing through the inevitable question with a mixture of bravado and rebellion ."
"`` don '' t lie , ellie ."
"i want explanations , '' he said forcefully ."
"`` why ? ''"
"she asked , trying to pullaway but he wouldn '' t let her go ."
"his arms on either side of her head kept her trapped underneath him ."
"she couldn '' t even look away from his intense gaze ."
"`` because you are a virgin and i want to know how that is possible . ''"
"she shrugged and looked at his shoulder which was as far as his arms would allow her head to move ."
"`` i '' m not sure i '' m the best person to give you a lesson in biology , '' she said almost angrily ."
"he was turning something that had been beautiful and moving into an interrogation and her best defense against authority had always been anger ."
"sighing , he pulled back slightly , his forehead resting on her shoulder ."
"`` why didn '' t you tell me ? ''"
"he asked more gently ."
"she almost didn '' t answer him , but since he was asking instead of demanding this time , she decided to relent slightly ."
"`` i '' ve been pretty sheltered my whole life . ''"
"his deep sigh shattered her even more than his angry questions had ."
"`` and now i '' ve come along and ruined you . ''"
"she had to laugh at his old fashioned term ."
"it eased the tension somewhat and for that , she was grateful ."
"`` i would hardly say i '' m ruined , '' she replied ."
"`` it doesn '' t really apply in this day and age , but i thank you for being concerned about my reputation ."
"if i guarantee that no one will know about our liaison tonight , will that make you feel better ?"
"and i don '' t have a father that will show up on your doorstep with a shotgun , demanding marriage . ''"
"her fingers gently touched his jaw line and she almost yelped when he suddenly reached out and nipped her fingers ."
"`` you were a virgin ."
"now you '' re not . ''"
"she smiled and didn '' t realize how her expression had turned her from a sweet , laughing innocent into a tempestuous beauty ."
"`` yes , you '' re right ."
"and i can guarantee that my changed stats from virgin to nonvirgin will not affect the sun rising tomorrow morning . ''"
"he stood up abruptly , then reached down to pick her up into his arms ."
"`` what '' s wrong ? ''"
"she asked , wrapping her arms around his neck ."
"`` where are we going ? ''"
"she asked nervously ."
"she hoped he wasn '' t going to demand that she get dressed and leave ."
"she had genuinely enjoyed talking with him and the languorousfeelings she '' d been experiencing in the aftermath of their interlude had been sweet and comforting ."
"`` we '' re going to take a warm shower and then talk ."
"i want to understand why you chose me to be your first lover , '' he said ."
"electra '' s mind scrambled ."
"she wasn '' t about to share her humiliating life with this wonderful , sophisticated man ."
"but she '' d definitely enjoy a shower with him ."
"the water was instantly warm and she reveled in his soft touch as he gently rubbed the soap along her body ."
"when he was done , he started to reach for the faucet to turn off the water but her hand stopped him ."
"with his look of inquiry , she reached for the bar of soap and stepped closer to him , rubbing the bar along the muscles that had so fascinated her earlier ."
"since her curiosity had been only minimally appeased before , she took time now to touch and feel to her heart '' s delight ."
"in the end , she only made it as far as his arms again before he growled and lifted her into his arms , impaling her on his shaft , his arms moving her as the force of their passion took over once again ."
"once the climax for both of them had subsided this time , electra could no longer stand on her own ."
"she leaned against him , absorbing his strength and shaking as he toweled her dry ."
"he picked her up , wrapped in the towel and carried her back to his bed ."
"once there , he tossed the towel away and pulled her into his arms ."
"with a simple press of a button , the lights flicked off ."
"only the lights from the london skyline lit the room ."
"electra laid next to him , her head resting on his chest and her eyes fought a losing battle to stay open ."
"she didn '' t want this night to end ."
"she wanted to touch him , to feel him inside her one more time but she just couldn '' t get her muscles to move any more ."
"`` go to sleep , '' he said softly , his hand rubbing her shoulder as he stared up at the ceiling ."
"`` we '' ll talk in the morning . ''"
"dharr waited until he felt her breathing become even before he examined his feelings ."
"he hated sharing his bed with women which is the main reason he put them up in apartments ."
"it allowed him to leave when he '' d taken his pleasure ."
"he '' d never spent the night with any of the women he '' d been with so why was this slender beauty tucked next to him and why did he know with an innate sense of himself that he had no intention of letting her go in the morning ?"
"he reviewed their entire conversations over the evening and earlier that afternoon , trying to find some point when he would have been forewarned of her innocence ."
"but nothing came up as a warning flag ."
"perhaps the initial kiss , but even then , she '' d caught onto his movements so quickly that he '' d been lured into a sense of complacency regarding her experience ."
"he almost laughed out loud at how quick of a learner she was ."
"everywhere he '' d touched her , she '' d come back at him with the same caress , the same movements ."
"until he moved inside her , that is ."
"when she was filled with his erection , she moved only for herself and it was a complete turn-on to watch her face and her body as she found fulfillment ."
"`` damit ! ''"
"he said out loud as his body hardened at the image floating in his mind ."
"looking down at the sleeping beauty in his arms , he wondered how he could want her so quickly after being satisfied three times already ."
"she was a mass of contradictions and he wanted to posses all of them ."
"he hadn '' t missed the rebellion that flashed through her eyes when he '' d demanded an explanation ."
"he almost chuckled at the memory of her response but restrained himself , afraid he would wake her with his amusement ."
"the audacity of a mere woman denying him something he wanted was ludicrous ."
"most men shivered in fear when he issued an order ."
"but this petite spitfire actually thought to deny him information ."
"didn '' t she know that no one denied him anything ?"
"he would get the reason for her innocence and more , he thought to himself moments before exhaustion took over ."
"he '' d also have her nicely ensconced in the paris apartment within the next few days ."
"in the meantime , he mentally made plans to have her accompany him on his meetings in dubai for the next couple of days ."
"chapter 4 electra moved slightly , then grimaced as the manacle holding her in place tightened ."
"her eyes opened and she looked around , trying to orient herself to her surroundings and the darkness ."
"when her memory of the night before returned , her face flamed into color but immediately following , a smile spread over her features ."
"she tried to turn around , but dharr '' s arm was still wrapped around her waist , her head pillowed on his massive arm while her bottom was nestled against his groin ."
"oh how she wished she could turn around and start the whole pleasure trip over again ; touch him , taste him and feel him move inside her one more time ."
"but that was not to be , she thought as she glanced at the clock and saw that it was after four o '' clock in the morning ."
"micha was still downstairs waiting on her , she suspectedand it wasn '' t fair to him ."
"besides , what was the point in waiting to wake in his arms in the morning ?"
"there was no future with this man , she knew ."
"he was dynamic and powerful and would move on to the next woman quickly ."
"she didn '' t delude herself into believing he would want her in his life beyond last night ."
"he was too passionate of a lover to settle for simply one woman ."
"she was just thrilled that she '' d experienced his magic touch this once ."
"electra ignored the sadness that entered her mind and continued to pretend she didn '' t care that another woman would probably be sharing his bed tonight as she disengaged her limbs from his ."
"easing out of bed slowly so as not to wake him , she quietly found and then pulled on her clothes ."
"she let her shoes dangle in her arms as she made her way out of the bedroom to the terrace where her purse had been left ."
"within fifteen minutes of waking , she was in the elevator being whisked down to the lobby once again ."
"hoping to brave out the initial embarrassment with micha , who could have no doubt what she '' d been doing for the past eight hours but suspected that might be impossible ."
"her hair was down , her makeup gone and her dress was wrinkled beyond repair ."
"but she also knew that there was a glow to her skin and a smile she couldn '' t suppress and she blushed when she saw micha quickly stand as she exited the elevator ."
"he didn '' t look her in the eye as she walked out to the street ."
"somehow , her car was waiting for her at the curb and the doorman politely tipped his hat as he held the door for the two of them ."
"electra had to chuckle as she drove home in the darkest part of the night ."
"she was probably the only woman in history who had to drive home from her first night of passion with her body guard in the passenger seat ."
"micha didn '' t talk throughout the entire trip and she didn '' t initiate any conversation either ."
"instead , she relived each moment , each conversation , every touch she '' d experienced throughout the night ."
"when she reached her house , she crept up t he stairs , careful so she didn '' t wake her grandmother who had been sleeping for several hours by now ."
"she brushed her teeth and slipped into her bed , smiling up at the ceiling ."
"it had been a perfect night , she thought to herself ."
"the only thing that could make this better would be to know that she would be experiencing dharr '' s touch once again ."
"but that was not to be , she knew ."
"she '' d settle for tonight and be glad that she '' d had a master initiate her into the world of passion ."
"the ringing from her purse woke her the following morning ."
"disoriented with exhaustion and sore muscles she hadn '' t realized existed , she quickly searched for her phone , desperate to find out who was calling and get rid of them so she could get back to sleep ."
"she almost considered turning it off without answering it , but her grandmother '' s lessons in manners wouldn '' t allow that to happen ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"she asked softly into the phone , not sure what time it was but sure it was early since the sun still hadn '' t made it over the edge of her bedroom window ."
"she quickly calculated that she '' d had less than three hours of sleep and that pained her since she was normally grumpy if she didn '' t get at least eight hours a night ."
"`` where the hell are you ? ''"
"a deep voice said angrily in her ear ."
"that voice woke her instantly and she sat up straight in bed , her eyes looking around her small bedroom to make sure no one else was able to hear the conversation ."
"`` dharr ? ''"
"she gasped ."
"thankfully the door to her bedroom was still closed ."
"`` are you expecting other men to demand your whereabouts first thing in the morning ? ''"
"he gritted out harshly ."
"she relaxed slightly against the pillows , her mind turning fuzzy as she tried to make sense of his angry tone of voice and early morning phone call ."
"`` no ."
"but i wasn '' t assuming you would care either . ''"
"`` so you slipped out like a.. '' `` don '' t say another word ! ''"
"she interrupted quickly , her body tensing and her eyes flashing even though he couldn '' t see her anger ."
"`` i don '' t think either one of us would appreciate the implications of your comment so just don '' t say it ! ''"
"she was shaking with anger and wanted to throw the phone across the room ."
"but ruining her phone wouldn '' t hurt him , more '' s the pity ."
"she heard him curse under his breath and could imagine him running his long , tanned fingers through his black hair in frustration ."
"the thought made her feel better , if only mildly ."
"`` where are you ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"`` we '' re not finished ."
"you owe me an explanation , '' he said , his voice calm but with a note of steel ."
"as usual , when someone demanded , electra rebelled ."
"first his awful comment and now this ?"
"`` i don '' t owe you anything , '' she snapped back ."
"then with a flick of her wrist , she snapped the cell phone closed , turning off the ringer and tossing it back into her purse ."
"dharr stared at the now dead phone in shock ."
"had she just hung up on him ?"
"the experience was unprecedented and he actually raised the phone to his ear and called her name , sure that the slip of a woman hadn '' t just hung up the phone on him ."
"the smile that crossed his face was slow in coming but it grew until it burst into a loud , full bodied laugh ."
"she '' d actually hung up on him !"
"no one had ever dared but this wild woman who had dared everything and challenged all he '' d known and countered every assumption he '' d had in a woman up to now , had really hung up on him ."
"he tossed the phone onto the bed and chuckled on his way to the shower , shaking his head in disbelief and a new-found respect for the female population in general , and one slender , sexy , vibrant woman in particular ."
"as he turned on the jets to the shower , he acknowledged that there was also the intense need to wring her pretty little neck but that would have to wait , and he had many more things he wanted to do to her before he punished her for her outright defiance ."
"walking out of his bedroom fifteen minutes later , freshly showered and shaved , he tossed the phone to jamil ."
"`` find out where she lives and get her settled into the paris apartment , '' he said ."
"without another word , he walked by the man frantically scribbling in his notebook as he moved toward his first meeting of the day ."
"chapter 5 glaring at the inanimate objectshe '' d just tossed across the room , electra sat up in bed , too angry to get back to sleep now ."
"`` how dare he ! ''"
"she said to the empty room ."
"what right did he have to speak to her like that ?"
"so she '' d left the morning after a night of passion ?"
"so it had been mind-boggling , toe-curling , hair scorching passion ?"
"what did he care ?"
"she '' d thought she '' d been doing him a favor by leaving ."
"she certainly didn '' t need the awkwardness of the morning after ."
"leaving had been in both their best interests ."
"he didn '' t have to follow through on all the regular niceties and she didn '' t have to hear his insincere , `` i '' ll call you , '' as she walked out the door ."
"this way , everyone came out the winner ."
"tossing the blankets off her , she stomped to the shower , waiting impatiently for the hot water to make its way up to the second floor ."
"memories of the previous night '' s passionate shower swirled through her mind and she almost shut off the shower again but felt the need to cleanse herself after his annoying phone call ."
"when the hot water finally arrived through the ancient plumbing , she scrubbed her body under the warm spray , angrily trying to forget the arrogant man '' s phone call and angry words ."
"unfortunately , she '' d never been very good at releasing her anger ."
"how dare he call her after the night they '' d just shared ?"
"it was less than two hours since she '' d slipped from his warm bed , completely naked and snuggled next to him ."
"the memories of their night started to filter into her mind and she wished desperately she could hang onto her anger ."
"but as she remembered the feelings he gave her and how her body responded to every touch of his , her anger started to dissipate ."
"it was hard to remain furious when her body was still tingling from what he '' d made her feel ."
"stepping out of the shower and toweling herself dry , she flicked her phone back on , wondering what she would do if he called again ."
"she pulled on a pair of jeans and a teeshirt , still fuming about the obnoxious man and thinking of the perfect thing to say , if only she '' d thought of it when he '' d called earlier ."
"as she walked down the stairs to the kitchen , her phonerang and she picked it up , checking the caller '' s number before answering it , just to make sure it wasn '' t dharr ."
"she ignored the disappointment in the pit of her stomach when she didn '' t recognize the caller ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"she said , pouring herself a cup of c offee ."
"it was her friend who worked in a small , private school down the street ."
"she tried not to worry too much about her disappointment that it was her friend and not dharr ."
"she '' d only known the man for twenty four hours and already she was needing to hear his voice ?"
"that was silly ."
"her friend , unaware of electra '' s topsy -turvy emotions for the past two hours , broke through her depression with a bright , cheerful voice ."
"`` i have a proposition for you , '' she started off ."
"`` remember the woman who was helping me out as a teacher '' s aide ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` sure , the one who was going to have a baby in the next few months ? ''"
"`` that '' s the one ."
"well , her doctor put her on full bed rest so she '' s unable to work right now ."
"the pay is extremely low , but if you want it , the job is yours , '' her friend said ."
"electra stood with her coffee cup midway to her mouth , frozen in shock ."
"`` are you teasing me ? ''"
"she asked ."
"a job she wouldn '' t need to interview for ?"
"a job where the interviewer wouldn '' t be intimidated by her body guards ?"
"was her luck finally changing ?"
"her friend laughed through the phone line at electra '' s surprise ."
"`` not at all ."
"are you interested ? ''"
"`` when can i start ? ''"
"electra gasped , setting her coffee cup down on the counter and searching out her grandmother '' s reassuring features ."
"her grandmother was sitting at the kitchen table working on the daily crossword puzzle but she obviously knew something good was happening since her face crinkled into a bright , encouraging smile ."
"`` whenever you '' re able ."
"if you don '' t have anything planned for today , you could come down and fill out the paperwork , '' she suggested hopefully ."
"electra glanced at her watch ."
"`` i can be there in thirty minutes . ''"
"`` great ."
"wear slacks that you don '' t mind getting dirty , '' she cautioned ."
"the next four days were the most amazing in electra '' s memory ."
"she was thrilled with her new job and , thanks to her guardian '' s barely touched monthly allowance and her room with her grandmother , she didn '' t care too much about the small income ."
"she helped her friend grade papers , clean up classrooms , tutored kids who were having problems with their homework or their classroom assignments , find additional materials pertinent to the current classroom topics and read stories to the group of twenty five seven year olds ."
"it was crazy at times , horrible during the moments when the children wanted to misbehave but also thrilling and creative and the children were filled with a sense of wonder at everything the teacher discussed ."
"she loved every moment of it ."
"she was so busy , she didn '' t even care that the man hadn '' t bothered to call back and apologize for his rude behavior ."
"or even to give her a chance to apologize for her fiery temper which had prompted her hang up ."
"and she wasn '' t upset about any of that ."
"she didn '' t miss him in any way , she told herself ."
"and when she dreamed about him at night and their one night together , she just put that up to having experienced superior lovemaking technique ."
"she was bound to feel remnants of their night together since it had been so wonderful ."
"when school let out on thursday afternoon and she watched the children leave the classroom , she pushed her sadness away ."
"the fact that the man hadn '' t called meant that she '' d done the right thing in leaving and definitely in hanging up on him when he was rude ."
"friday afternoon , when she sank gratefully into one of the two overstuffed chairs in her grandmother '' s small family room , she was exhausted but in an odd way , rejuvenated ."
"`` good week ? ''"
"her grandmother asked , a gentle smile on her face as she manipulated thread and needle through fabric to magically transform the fabric into a cross stitch pillow ."
"electra laughed ."
"`` thrilling , '' she replied , thinking of the man who had started off the week in such a wonderful way ."
"`` every moment of it . ''"
"`` what about the man you spent time with on sunday evening ? ''"
"she questioned ."
"electra blushed and was glad gerrard was in the kitchen reading a newspaper ."
"`` he called but i hung up on him . ''"
"she heard the newspaper rumble and the chair scrape against the tiles a moment before gerrard '' s horrified expression peered into the room ."
"`` what did you just say ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra smiled gently , knowing how gerrard , the most moody of the three assigned to her , could sometimes take things the wrong way ."
"`` i said that the man called but i hung up on him.he was rude and said some awful things to me ."
"or he would have if i hadn '' t stopped him , '' she clarified with a frown ."
"gerrard '' s throat made some odd sounds but electra didn '' t have time to interpret them before he went on ."
"`` did you call back and apologize ? ''"
"he asked , coming fully into the room and looking down at her from his greater height ."
"electra didn '' t understand the expression on his face ."
"it wasn '' t anger so much as disbelief ."
"maybe even horror , she thought ."
"`` no ."
"why would i do that ?"
"he was rude and demanding . ''"
"gerrard '' s palm slapped against his forehead and he shook his head as he walked back into the kitchen ."
"she heard him talking on his phone a moment later but since it was in arabic , she had no idea what he was saying ."
"turning back to her grandmother , she started to speak but was interrupted by her phone ringing ."
"she walked over to her purse and pulled the phone out , noting that it was another phone number she didn '' t recognize ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"`` good afternoon , ellie , '' dharr '' s deep voice said through the airwaves , sending tingles down her body , right to the core of her soul ."
"she stiffened and looked around , wondering if her discussion of the man had somehow produced the phone call ."
"it was very odd , she thought ."
"she ignored the ripple of excitement that traveled along her nervous system at the sound of his voice and reminded herself about how arrogant and rude he had been ."
"the man just simply didn '' t know good manners , she thought ."
"`` good afternoon , dharr ."
"how are you ? ''"
"she replied with great formality ."
"no matter how desperately she '' d wanted to hear his voice this past week , to tell him about her new job and to just hear his laughter or advice , she couldn '' t fall into the trap of discounting how hurt she '' d been by his statements that morning and the fact that he hadn '' t called her at all during the week ."
"she heard his soft chuckle but didn '' t like the fact that it sent images to her mind of him chuckling at her attempts to undo his buttons that night ."
"his next words erased all images , all thoughts , leaving her shaking and confused ."
"`` fine ."
"but i '' d be better if you '' d meet me in paris for the weekend . ''"
"electra gasped ."
"an entire weekend wit h the man ?"
"was it possible ?"
"`` paris ? ''"
"she asked and looked across the roomat her grandmother ."
"she saw the elderly woman '' s eyes light up and her head bobbed in an enthusiastic agreement ."
"`` go , '' she whispered encouragingly , her needlework forgotten in the excitement of the moment ."
"she could hear the amusement in his voice ."
"`` yes , the city across the channel from london ?"
"perhaps you '' ve heard of it , '' he teased ."
"electra smiled ."
"boy the man had charm to spare !"
"`` yes ."
"i '' ve heard of it vaguely ."
"but why would i want to spend the weekend in some boring old city ?"
"i mean , what '' s the draw ? ''"
"she asked , leaning back in her chair and smiling delightedly ."
"how she found the nerve to tease him back , she had no idea ."
"all thoughts of making the man apologize were forgotten as soon as she '' d heard his charming , teasing tone ."
"the ripple of laughter made her feel all warm and yummy inside ."
"`` perhaps there is a lure i can provide . ''"
"electra liked the sound of that ."
"`` perhaps , '' she said ."
"`` what did you have in mind ? ''"
"`` how about if i show you when you get here ?"
"give me your address and i '' ll send a car to pick you up ."
"don '' t forget your passport , '' he warned ."
"electra bit her lip ."
"`` hmmm ... how about if i meet you there ? ''"
"she suggested , knowing she '' d have to purchase several tickets for her guards ."
"there would be no way they '' d let her get on an international flight with out them tagging along ."
"good grief , she couldn '' t even go to the grocery store without them in the background ."
"`` what '' s your address ? ''"
"he countered firmly ."
"she sighed , but was still unwilling to tell him all ."
"`` dharr , i would love to meet you but i '' m not sure what time i '' ll be able to get away , '' she lied ."
"`` i got a job this week and i still have some research to do for one of my classes plus i need to pull materials together for the following week '' s crafts ."
"the flights to paris are only two hours , aren '' t they ?"
"so i '' ll call you when i land ."
"will that work for you ? ''"
"`` absolutely not , '' he said firmly ."
"`` you '' ll need to quit your job immediately ."
"i '' ll take care of you ."
"tell me your address . ''"
"his tone didn '' t seem like he would be swayed by any argument she had ."
"shaking her head , even though he couldn '' t see her through the phone ."
"`` no ."
"i '' m not going to quit my job since i just started it four days ago ."
"and i '' m not going to give you my address but i '' ll be happy to meet you in paris in a few hours ."
"will you be at this phone number ? ''"
"she asked ."
"there was a long moment of silence and she held her breath , hoping he wouldn '' t ask more questions or demand an explanation ."
"or more horribly , call off the weekend ."
"she wanted desperately to see him , but not at the expense of her pride and her newfound independence , no matter how small it was ."
"finally , he said , `` fine ."
"call this number and a car will arrive at the airport to pick you up ."
"but ellie , we '' ll have a conversation when you arrive about how this relationship is going to move forward . ''"
"without another word , the phone went dead ."
"electra considered calling him back and telling him that she wouldn '' t come if he was going to dictate to her but she realized that she '' d missed him terribly over the past four days ."
"she wanted to feel his strong arms around her and experience his magic touch once more ."
"and she felt strong enough to handle whatever demands he threw at her ."
"her grandmother laughed softly from her seat by the window , her cross stitch laying across her flowered dress in her lap ."
"`` i can see from the look in your eyes that you '' re angry with the man for whatever he just said , but don '' t let that get in the way of seeing him this weekend ."
"go pack your bags and , while you '' re at it , come up with a way to talk to him and work out your differences.i '' ve told you over and over again that your temper is going to destroy you , dear ."
"don '' t let it destroy a little sliver of happiness now ."
"leave that temper simmering until you '' re old like me ."
"anger makes a poor bed-fellow ."
"and even worse memories , '' she chided ."
"electra '' s hand dropped to her side and she stared at her elderly grandmother ."
"`` aren '' t you shocked that i '' ll be spending the weekend with a man ? ''"
"she asked tentatively ."
"edna shook her head and waved her hand in the air dismissively ."
"`` oh , pish , '' she said ."
"`` it '' s about time you had a little romance in your life ."
"besides , i '' d like a few grandchildren so if you don '' t hurry up and find a man to help you with that then it will be too late . ''"
"electra smiled and shook her head ."
"bending down to kiss her weathered cheek , she said , `` grandmother , you continue to astonish me , '' she said ."
"her grandmother laughed softly ."
"`` well , you just figure out a way to astonish me and learn to keep that temper of yours under control , '' she warned ."
"`` i saw the flare of anger in your eyes during that brief phone conversation and it won '' t help me get my grandbabies , '' she warned teasingly ."
"electra could only laugh in agreement as she skipped up the stairs ."
"`` gerrard , i '' m going to call the airlines to reserve four seats on a plane to paris ."
"pack your bag ! ''"
"she called from the top of the stairway ."
"she immediately picked up the phone and , within ten minutes , had all four of them booked on a first class plane to paris in three hours ."
"she called dharr and left him a voice mail on her arrival time then happily packed a small suitcase filled with her prettiest clothes , singing under her breath as she packed and anticipated being in dharr '' s arms once again ."
"later that evening , she walked down the gangway of the paris airport ."
"she looked around but didn '' t see dharr anywhere but she recognized one of his aides who immediately walked up to her and bowed ."
"`` good evening , '' he said ."
"`` i '' m to take you to the paris apartment ."
"did you check your other bags ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra shook her head ."
"`` no , this is all i have , '' she said , indicating the small carry-on luggage trailing behind her on wheels ."
"she had no idea how much luggage the man expected her to bring for two days ."
"the man looked confused but nodded politely ."
"`` this way , '' he said and walked forward , guiding her through the busy airport ."
"she didn '' t concern herself with micha and the other guards ."
"let them follow her as best she could ."
"she wasn '' t going to let them hinder her in any way ."
"as she walked out of the airport into the heavily congested front gate , she immediately saw the limousine waiting out front with almost identical large , massively built guards as the three behind her ."
"she thought it odd but knew that dharr was extremely wealthy and probably had kidnapping concerns ."
"ducking into the back , she felt grateful for the relative quiet of the plush environment ."
"they were pulling up outside an ornate building in the heart of paris and electra was almost bouncing with the excitement of seeing dharr once again ."
"as soon as the car pulled up beside the curb , she jumped out of the car , not bothering to wait for the chauffer to come around and open the door ."
"she walked through the lobby , smiling brightly at the doorman , dharr '' s assistant right behind her ."
"`` here is the key for your apartment , '' he said , handing her a large , old-fashioned key ."
"`` i '' ll show you around the rooms , '' he said and walked in ahead of her ."
"`` the kitchen is through there , '' he said , pointing to a double set of doors ."
"he continued to walk through the beautifully decorated apartment , giving her the name of the housekeeper and the cook who could be called upon to make more elaborate meals if she desired to entertain more lavishly than the cook '' s normal fare ."
"when he led her to down the hall to what was obviously the bedrooms , she stopped him ."
"`` i think i can find my way through the rest of the place ."
"where is dharr ? ''"
"she asked ."
"the man stiffened slightly before he replied , `` he should be arriving any moment now , madam , '' he said and backed quietly out of the apartment ."
"electra looked around , stunned to see that this was not a hotel but an actual apartment complete with every conceivable luxury ."
"she wandered into the bedroom and opened closets , finding some of dharr '' s clothes in one but the other was filled with women '' s clothing , still in the plastic coverings with tags on ."
"there were more clothes than a man could need in a single weekend and she assumed that this must be his own apartment for when he was in paris ."
"it was about a quarter of the size of his london flat but perhaps he didn '' t stay here very often ."
"all thoughts and suppositions about the beautiful apartment were swept away when she heard the front door open ."
"running out of the bedroom , she hurried to the living room , for the first time wondering where her guards were , but not really caring as dharr walked through the door ."
"at the first sight of him , her breath caught in her throat and she stopped short , taking in the overwhelming magnificence of him ."
"he was wearing a dark suit and his hair was neatly combed but when his dark , intense eyes saw her , one hand reached up to pull his tie lose , his long , determined strides eating up the distance between their bodies ."
"when he reached her , he grabbed her around the waist and lifted her up so her mouth was almost even with his ."
"his lips captured hers in a kiss meant to convey possession , absolute domination and electra could no more deny that possession and power than she could stop her heart beat from racing ."
"her arms wound around his neck and her legs around his hips and she couldn '' t seem to get enough of him ."
"she wanted this man unlike anything she '' d ever desired and , being so new to the world of passion , she was unable to hide it from him ."
"she wasn '' t sure she would even if she were more experienced ."
"she had no idea of the passage of time or the movement of their bodies until she felt the soft mattress beneath her back and his warm hand against her naked breast ."
"how her shirt had come off , she had no idea ."
"the rest of their clothes were removed just as quickly and she was gasping for breath as his hands roved all over her body , his fingers touching , his lips tasting , the rest of him moving in ways that elicited just as much passion and her mind whirled with the feelings ."
"she tried to slow down , to figure out what to do and how she could touch him but he was merciless in his passion and she accepted his dominance , reveling in it and feeling powerful that she could also make him feel this way ."
"when he entered her , she cried out and felt complete for the first time in a week ."
"until he started moving that is ."
"then she wasn '' t ready for the intensity of the feelings , the desire pounding within her as she clamored to find the release that would ease the painful yearning deep inside her ."
"when she finally climaxed , she could only scream as the waves rolled over her , crashing against her body as the pleasure increased , then slowly subsided , leaving her limp and exhausted , but also cradled gently in his arms ."
"he lifted off of her , bearing his weight on his arms as he looked down at her ."
"`` good evening , '' he replied with a twinkle in his eyes ."
"electra laughed , still trying to catch her breath ."
"`` good evening to you , '' she replied just as formally ."
"`` how was your day ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he threw back his head and laughed ."
"`` the ending was perfect , '' he said ."
"she sighed happily and speared her fingers through his hair ."
"`` i agree , '' she replied ."
"`` will you always be this passionate when i walk through the door ? ''"
"he asked , his head bending to nibble her ear lobe ."
"electra wriggled , initially starting to evade his mouth but then accepted that this was exactly why she '' d come to paris ."
"`` i don '' t know ."
"why don '' t you go back out and try it again ."
"i '' ll see if i can rouse myself for the same performance , '' she said airily and her bottom was swatted for her efforts ."
"she laughed and lifted her legs to wrap around his hips once again ."
"`` perhaps i '' m happy to have you right where you are after all , '' she said and groaned when his mouth covered her nipple ."
"he '' d never left her body so when he started to move in and out again , she was more than ready for the feelings ."
"chapter 6 saturday morning dawned bright and early but electra woke to find herself alone in bed ."
"she bit her lower lip , wondering what one did in these kinds of situations ."
"she '' d never woken up in another man '' s bed before ."
"well , she corrected , once but she didn '' t think he would like it if she slipped out of the apartment and went home ."
"she didn '' t want to do that anyway ."
"they had the whole weekend together and they '' d spent one glorious night in bed together , laughing and making love , sipping champagne and nibbling on cheese and crackers for dinner instead of going out for a formal meal in a restaurant or having their privacy invaded by the cook ."
"but now the morning sunlight was streaming in through the long windows and she was naked underneath the white sheet ."
"chewing nervously on her lip , she wondered where dharr was and how she was going to get from the bed to the bathroom without him seeing her naked ."
"even though he '' d seen every part of her body by now , she was still shy ."
"she wasn '' t up for that kind of show just yet ."
"deciding she should just brave the situation and pray that he wasn '' t going to see her leap from the bed to the bathroom , she stood up and rushed across the floor , glad to find a terry robe hanging in the bathroom ."
"she showered , then wrapped her hair in a big , fluffy towel and her body in the soft , white robe , rolling up the sleeves several times so her hands could come out the ends ."
"she padded barefoot into the living room and stopped short when she caught sight of him sitting on the terrace eating a piece of toast and reading the newspaper ."
"he was only wearing a pair of worn jeans but without a shirt , his legs stretched out underneath the glass topped table and his bare feet crossed at the ankles ."
"he looked exactly like any romantic movie portrayed the man the morning after a wonderful night of making love ."
"she wanted to just stand there and watch him , amazed at how handsome he was , and how powerful looking in just the jeans but with his chest bare and glistening in the early morning sunshine ."
"he looked up and caught her staring and she blushed , wondering what he must think of her ."
"but he only waved her toward him , then stood up and kissed her softly , lingeringly ."
"`` good morning , '' he said , his voice deep and husky ."
"`` you look delicious in my robe , '' he said ."
"he pulled her close , his hands holding onto her waist ."
"`` i '' ll bet you '' ll taste sweeter than the honey on the table , '' he said , his dark eyes looking down into her green ones with blazing desire shining through ."
"electra laughed self-consc iously and pushed gently at his chest ."
"`` don '' t tease , '' she said and slipped into one of the comfortable chairs ."
"she reached out and poured herself a cup almost half full with coffee , then the rest she filled with cream , uncaring this time if he considered her coffee simply a cream and sugar transport mechanism ."
"`` i was wondering about that , '' he said softly as he picked up his own cup and took a sip ."
"`` wondering about what ? ''"
"she asked as she scooped two large spoonfuls of sugar into the delicate bone china ."
"`` why you were grimacing the other day when you drank your coffee black ."
"now i understand , '' he said ."
"she looked at him with her lashes lowered and said , `` you don '' t really understand , but that '' s okay . ''"
"a part of her wanted to tell him everything about her past , the silly guards , the man who thought she had to be protected , even from herself ."
"but it was too fine of a morning for sad thoughts and she wanted to enjoy this dynamic man '' s company without any of the worries she normally carried around ."
"for the next thirty six hours , she was just a woman without cares or concerns ."
"`` what is on the agenda today ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` how about a shopping trip ? ''"
"he suggested ."
"she pulled a grimace ."
"`` shopping ?"
"in paris ?"
"i know this is the fashion capital of the world , but wouldn '' t it be more interesting to see some of the museums ?"
"i '' ve never been to paris . ''"
"he considered her words for a long moment , his eyes taking in her amazingly beautiful features , clean of makeup with her hair twisted into the thick towel ."
"a woman who didn '' t want to spend his time in tedious shops and his money on clothes she couldn '' t wear ?"
"even more intriguing !"
"`` what museums would you like to see ? ''"
"he asked , ignoring the desire to ask her more questions about her dislike of shopping ."
"she bit her lip and gauged his reaction ."
"`` well , would you m ind terribly if we went up the eiffel tower ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` i know it seems very touristy but i '' ve never been ."
"nor have i seen the champs elysee and i '' ve heard that the stairs go up a dark , scary hallway . ''"
"she wriggled her eye brows across the table at him , `` i '' ll race you ! ''"
"she challenged , seeing that he was weakening ."
"dharr laughed outright and shook his head ."
"`` how about if we compromise ? ''"
"she took a sip of her coffee and watched him from over the rim of her cup ."
"`` i '' m listening . ''"
"`` i '' ll take you to every tourist attraction you want , '' he said , leaning back casually against the back of the chair , the epitome of a commanding male with his washboard stomach and sexy , not-yetshaved profile , `` but then we patronize some of my favorite stores ."
"deal ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra nibbled on a piece of toast , wondering what could be wrong with his agreement ."
"why would he be challenging her with a shopping trip ?"
"and he was definitely challenging her , she knew from the daring looking his eyes ."
"he didn '' t think she would agree and a part of her suspected she shouldn '' t. but what harm would come of a simple shopping trip if it made him happy ?"
"he was willing to do what she wanted in the morning , she could meet him halfway ."
"of course , she didn '' t really need any new clothes but if that '' s what he wanted , who was she to stop him ?"
"maybe he wanted her to dress in more sophisticated outfits instead of the casual jeans she '' d been wearing yesterday when he '' d walked into the apartment ."
"`` sure ."
"why not ? ''"
"she finally agreed ."
"the flare of triumph that came into his eyes made her hesitate but she couldn '' t imagine what the problem might be ."
"just as he promised , dharr took her through all the parisian tourist `` s sites ."
"since she was in the back of the limousine with dharr and the tinted windows made it a little difficult to see outside , she just enjoyed watching him as they talked about nothing in particular ."
"if she '' d made the effort to look out the window , she '' d have seen the police escort which blocked off side streets , easing their way through the city to each of the major attractions ."
"they hit the eiffel tower first and electra was thrilled with the wind whipping through her hair as they walked along the steel sidewalk at the top and looked down at all the people meandering through the park , looking like tiny ants from this distance ."
"they hit the louvre but only had time to see some of the larger exhibits such as the mona lisa or napoleon '' s `` apartment '' , then a walk down the street toward the champs elysee ."
"electra had spied the magnificent structure from the entrance to the louvre and she '' d thought a walk would be nice ."
"but it was much longer than she '' d anticipated ."
"it was still thrilling and she loved walking hand in hand with dharr , asking him questions about his previous visits to the spectacular city and all the various other places he '' d visited throughout his lifetime ."
"she found that he was a very well traveled man and was impressed that he remembered so much about his visits ."
"once in the champs elysee , she started at the bottom of the stairs and looked up ."
"`` are you sure you want to do this ? ''"
"he asked , one eyebrow raised as he noticed her staring warily up at the dark , yellowed-withage corridor ."
"`` there '' s an elevator off to the side which most of the other visitors take . ''"
"electra considered it for all of two seconds ."
"then she shook her head ."
"`` nope , '' she replied , still looking warily up at the corridor ."
"`` i want to do the stairs . ''"
"with another deep breath , she plunged ahead , almost racing up the stairs , eager to reach the top ."
"halfway up , she stopped to catch her breath , her hands holding onto the railing ."
"`` i '' m not sure this was such a good idea , '' she laughed and saw what now seemed to be endless stairs ."
"dharr stood behind her ."
"`` i '' m enjoying it immensely , '' he said ."
"electra turned and looked down at him , only to find his gaze on her derriere instead of up ahead ."
"turning around , her hands ineffectually covered her bottom ."
"`` you ... ! ''"
"she sputtered , laughing at his lascivious expression ."
"`` do you have a one track mind ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he took the last two steps separating them and pinned her against the wall ."
"`` when you '' re cute little bottom is right in front of me , yes ."
"i can only think of one thing ."
"that '' s taking you into my arms , my hands cradling your bottom as i push myself into your softness , '' he said and his mouth covered hers , his teeth biting her bottom lip , then sucking it gently ."
"`` any other questions ? ''"
"he asked , one hand covering her bottom just the way he '' d described it a moment before ."
"she was still breathless , but now for a different reason , the stairs and close hallway forgotten as his mouth covered hers."
"``"
"toujour amour ! ''"
"a voice said from slightly below them on the stairs ."
"electra pulled away from him quickly , her face turning red as she realized their kiss was holding up about ten students who were also climbing the stairs to the top ."
"she smiled and turned quickly away , heading up the stairs with more purpose ."
"when they reached the top , she was excited to see the traffic below and around them ."
"and when dharr '' s arms wrapped around her from behind , she smiled into his laughing eyes , her hair whipping around them ."
"`` was the climb worthwhile ? ''"
"he asked in his husky , sexy deep voice ."
"she laughed ."
"`` absolutely , '' she replied ."
"they strolled through notre dame , montmartre and he even bought her a chocolate crepe which was made by a street vendor while they watched , although she suspected the only reason he bought it for her was so he could lick the chocolate off her face when she was finished ."
"electra didn '' t mind at all except for the fact that , when he was finished sensuously cleaning her face , she wanted him to finish satisfying her ."
"between the kiss in the champs elysee and the chocolate crepe , she was desperate for him in a way she '' d never felt about any other man ."
"after a lovely lunch at a sidewalk cafe , he announced , `` now that we '' ve been to all of your choices , the afternoon is mine . ''"
"without explaining where they were going , he pulled her into the limousine that had been driving them all over the city and took her to a very pretty little boutique ."
"but inside , the store was filled with lingerie , some of it made up completely of lace in all different colors , others in satin , corsets , demi bras , all types of panties ."
"dharr when through the store with an assistant and pointed to the various items he wanted , choosing so many colors and styles electra could barely remember them all ."
"when the items were packed up , paid for and stored in the limousine , electra was both excited and nervous about what he might expect ."
"`` now where do we go ? ''"
"she asked , eagerly anticipating his possible answers ."
"would he want to go somewhere else to shop ?"
"she desperately hoped not ."
"electra was so turned on at the prospect of wearing some of her new under things she could barely think ."
"`` now we go home , '' he said with a gleam in his eyes that electra couldn '' t misinterpret ."
"back at the apartment , the chauffer carried all the packages into the beautiful living room and left quietly ."
"dharr picked up box after box , obviously searching for something particular ."
"she almost gasped when he stopped , having found what he was looking for ."
"the set of black lace suspended from his fingers , the little pieces of nothing dangling on his index finger as he approached ."
"`` these first , '' he said and , after handing them to her , sat down on the sofa , relaxed as if he were about to watch a football game ."
"electra smiled tentatively , more turned on than she wanted to admit ."
"`` i '' ll be right back , '' she said ."
"she slipped into the bedroom and came out a few minutes later wearing the black lace ."
"the bra barely covered her nipples and the underwear barely covered her bottom but she felt pretty and sexy as she sauntered out in front of him ."
"she tried to pretend she was just a fashion model doing her job , but when his eyes lit up at her appearance , she could no longer feign casualness any longer ."
"she wanted to feel his hands on her and press herself into his hard planes ."
"but he only sat there , his eyes glowing from the desire as he watched her walk back and forth ."
"`` well ? ''"
"she said , frustrated that he wouldn '' t pull her into his arms and make love to her ."
"`` now the red one , '' he said and picked up the box containing a red satin bra and panties set ."
"this one at least had a robe to go with it , so she took all three pieces to the bedroom and changed hurriedly ."
"when she walked out , she was completely covered with the robe ."
"`` how '' s this one ? ''"
"she asked , twirling around ."
"`` take off the robe and let me see , '' he said softly , his deep voice revealing how much he liked the outfit ."
"she turned so her back was facing him and untied the sash ."
"slowly , she lowered the robe to her waist ."
"`` like it ? ''"
"she asked , her head turned coquettishly to the side ."
"`` i '' d like it even better if you '' d turn around , '' he ordered ."
"instead , she lowered the robe further , revealing the thong of her underwear and almost gasped when she felt his hands on her bottom , then sliding upwards to her slim waist ."
"`` turn around , '' he ordered again , his hands spinning her around to make sure she complied ."
"his eyes were hot as he took in the satin that pushed her breasts higher and his finger trailed down the cleft , then back up the satin and sliding inside , teasing her by not touching the nipple ."
"electra '' s head fell backwards and her body almost sank down into the thick carpeting beneath her feet ."
"she leaned into him but he wouldn '' t give her what she wanted ."
"`` please , '' she breathed ."
"he was relentless and pushed her back so her bottom was on the back of the chair ."
"with expertise , he unsnapped the bra , tossing it off to the side as his fingers continued their exploration ."
"he touched her with nothing else but the tips of his fingers but he left nothing untouched ."
"all over , wildfire burned across her skin while her hands held onto the chair behind her ."
"kneeling in front of her , he slowly slid the red satin down her legs and moved between her knees ."
"electra '' s head was spinning with the pleasure of just his fingers but when his mouth covered her , she gasped and fell back against the edge of the chair ."
"dharr held her steady as his mouth brought her to an almost instantaneous climax ."
"he allowed her a small reprieve before he discarded his own clothes and moved inside her ."
"she was unable to breath , think and barely move because of her position on the chair but the whole experience made her feel vulnerable and sexy ."
"after only a few thrusts , she was shaking with her second climax and hanging onto his broad shoulders as if he were the only solid force in the world ."
"he quickly followed with his own release , then gently picked her up and carried her to the bedroom where he continued to make love to her for the next three hours ."
"that night , sitting in the opera , electra glanced over at the man next to her ."
"her whole world had changed in the past seven days and she was not sure how to gain control of it again ."
"dharr had control of her body with just a single touch ."
"he was basically hers to command and , although she liked it in the bedroom , she thought about how wonderful it had been walking through the streets of paris with him ."
"this was much more than just sex , she realized ."
"what had turned out to be a time for her to have an affair with a man more glorious than any of her dreams , had turned out to be something different ."
"she wasn '' t sure what it could be , but she was certainly enjoying herself ."
"sighing happily , she turned back to face the stage , the actors doing a very good job of camille but she wasn '' t paying much attention to them ."
"she was reliving every moment of their morning and afternoon together , hoping that tomorrow would be just as fun ."
"chapter 7 monday dawned gloomy and boring after a dazzling weekend spent with dharr ."
"she was still excited to see all the kids again , but without him to wake up next to , there was just something missing ."
"for the next five days , she worked hard to gain more experience at the school ."
"she '' d learned a great deal during her years at school , but applying her knowledge while absorbing the reality of teaching was exhausting ."
"the children were delightful and dharr called every evening to ask her about her day ."
"he never revealed anything about his own day except for silly things people said or did which always made her laugh ."
"but when she hung up the phone , she wished she had asked more about him ."
"he always seemed very interested in her day and what she '' d done and she was felt self-centered when she realized that she hadn '' t heard anything about his day ."
"i t wasn '' t just about that she wanted to reciprocate , she thought as she flicked off her light one night and stared out the dark window at the stars and moon ."
"she found that she wanted to know more about the man ."
"she wanted to know everything there was to learn about him ."
"she found him intellectually fascinating as well as physically appealing ."
"she chuckled and pulled the covers up higher ."
"the term `` appealing '' wasn '' t enough for what she felt for dharr ."
"there was something about him that lured her in an elemental way ."
"it wasn '' t just his looks ."
"it was a combination of his dominating personality , his dangerous looks and the aura of power that surrounded him ."
"throw in an obviously superior intelligence and that gorgeous body and electra knew she was completely infatuated with the man ."
"she should be concerned but she didn '' t examine what had become , in a short span of time , an addiction ."
"thursday night , she picked up her cell phone , answering it on the first ring , knowing it would be dharr ."
"`` hello ! ''"
"she sing-songed ."
"`` good evening , sunshine ."
"what are you doing this weekend ? ''"
"he asked and her heart skipped a beat when she heard the smile in his voice ."
"`` hmmm ... . ''"
"she started off saying ."
"`` i have loads of laundry to do and i might weed the garden ."
"what areyou doing ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` how about if i send someone over to do your laundry and weeding for you and you come skiing with me ? ''"
"he suggested ."
"electra laughed , delighted with his skiing idea but unwilling to have him pay someone to do her laundry ."
"`` the skiing is a deal ."
"the other stuff , no way . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` because i can do my own laundry and my grandmother would kill me if i dug in her garden so it was just a way to tease you ."
"i actually don '' t know the difference between a dandelion and a lily . ''"
"`` good ."
"give me your address and i '' ll have someone pick you up tomorrow morning , '' he said ."
"electra '' s mood immediately dropped ."
"why did they talk about this each time he wanted to see her ?"
"was this going to become an issue ?"
"or was there some way she could make him understand how important this job was to her ?"
"`` dharr , i can '' t leave tomorrow ."
"i have to work , '' she said softly but firmly ."
"he was equally firm ."
"`` no ."
"you don '' t need to work ."
"quit your job and come skiing with me ."
"i '' ll take care of you . ''"
"electra suppressed an angry response , remembering her grandmother '' s advice on how she needed to control her temper ."
"`` that '' s not possible ."
"i like working and , with the amount i get paid , money isn '' t really the issue . ''"
"there was a long pause and electra waited tensely for his response ."
"she desperately hoped this would not be the end of their relationship ."
"if he was adamant , would she give up her job ?"
"was she that pathetic with her need to see him ?"
"to be with him ?"
"no !"
"she couldn '' t do that ."
"her self-respect was on the line here and she would just have to firm up her resolve ."
"there was no way she could live without this job ."
"as addicted to dharr as she knew she had become , she also was addicted to the thrill of her position and the laughter of the children , not to mention the love of seeing their fascination with the world and with learning ."
"`` what are you telling me ? ''"
"he said , his voice suddenly ominous ."
"gripping her phone tightly and closing her eyes so she could remain firmly in control of both her anger and her resolve , she explained as patiently as possible , `` i '' m telling you that i have to work tomorrow ."
"if you still want me to go skiing , then i '' ll catch a plane out tomorrow afternoon when school lets out ."
"but i won '' t let you pay for my plane ticket either . ''"
"there was a long pause before he said , `` i can see we forgot to have our conversation last weekend ."
"fine , call me with the details of your flight and i '' ll have someone meet you , '' he said ."
"he gave her a phone number and then rung off , but electra could tell that he was still angry with her ."
"electra had trouble sleeping that night , thoughts of their brief conversation running through her mind ."
"the man thought he could have everything his way but she was going to teach him the art of compromise , she vowed ."
"he was obviously extremely wealthy and with wealth came power and power meant getting his own way ."
"it was time for a wakeup call ."
"and she was definitely the woman for the job ."
"toward dawn , having gotten no sleep as she tossed and turned , she wondered if she was really the right person to take dharr down a peg or two in his arrogance ."
"maybe he '' d just move on to the next woman , someone who would be more compliant ."
"the thought of dharr holding another woman made her stomach churn with anger and disgust ."
"she hated the idea and wanted to rip out the unknown woman '' s hair ."
"she was being silly , she thought as she tossed the covers back and stumbled to the shower ."
"the water revived her muddled , sleep deprived mind and several cups of coffee during the day helped as well ."
"but the moment she stepped onto the flight to switzerland , her mind started working in overtime ."
"would he still be angry ?"
"would this be their last weekend together ?"
"electra knew it was her exhaustion making her mind crazy so she tried to relax and lay her head down against the reclining chair ."
"but the idea of another woman in dharr '' s arms hadn '' t left her mind and closing her eyes only made her jealousy more intense as her head created images of him moving on ."
"when the plane landed , she gritted her teeth ."
"if he was going to move on to a more compliant and pathetic woman , then let him ."
"she didn '' t need him , she reminded herself ."
"she '' d lived twenty four years with out the man , she could easily get over him ."
"she '' d only known him for threeweeks so he wasn '' t quite the addiction she '' d thought he was ."
"and if that was a lie ?"
"electra ignored that idea ."
"staring out the windows of the limousine he '' d had waiting for her , she could barely make out the snow covered streets but she could care less if there was a beach house with sand surrounding it or snow piled ten feet deep ."
"she was too tired for anything and dharr was on that list ."
"but then she walked into the lovely log cabin and saw him talking on a cell phone ."
"all thoughts of other women , of leaving him , of anything other than falling into his arms was forgotten ."
"dharr took one look at her when she walked through the door and cut off his conversation , tossing the phone onto a table and walking swiftly toward the woman who looked about ready to fall into the floor ."
"`` what '' s wrong ? ''"
"he asked as he lifted her up into his arms ."
"`` nothing , '' she said but the effect was lost when she sniffled into his neck ."
"he pulled back and noted the dark circles under her eyes and the tense posture ."
"`` talk to me ."
"what has you so upset ? ''"
"he demanded , pulling her close , the need to protect her leaping out at him ."
"he frowned , not understanding or liking the need to protect ."
"he '' d always considered women gentle and would never physically hurt them ."
"but this need wasn '' t about the physical ."
"dharr realized that , for the first time , he was concerned about a woman '' s mental and emotional protection ."
"in the past , he '' d expected the women he '' d been with to be uncomplicated and served only one purpose , to warm his bed when it was convenient to him ."
"this woman snuggling in his arms , crying softly , didn '' t fit the mold ."
"she wasn '' t acting properly and he knew he should find a woman who was more appropriate mistress material ."
"butsince meeting her , he hadn '' t even looked at another woman in a sexual way ."
"he listened to her sniffling die down and felt her body relax ."
"he was astonished when , twenty minutes later , he realized that she '' d fallen asleep in his arms ."
"a woman had fallen asleep on him ?"
"ludicrous !"
"impossible ?"
"dharr looked down at her sleeping expression , her beautiful , expressive eyes shuttered from his gaze ."
"he liked her eyes , he knew ."
"he could tell everything she was thinking since her emotions were written all over her face ."
"he '' d learned early in life to school his features so no one could read his thoughts ."
"his body language , his expressions , his mannerisms all oriented toward not revealing any secrets the international press might latch onto ."
"he understood that every word he spoke , every action in public , every raised eyebrow would be analyzed for hidden references ."
"saying `` good morning '' in the wrong way could change the stock markets for the day ."
"sighing heavily , he stood up and inhaled the scent of her soft perfume ."
"she was too light , he thought as he carried her into the bedroom ."
"he pulled off her boots and took the clip out of her hair ."
"looking down at her , he knew he should just pull the covers over her and leave her to sleep ."
"he had no idea why she was so exhausted but he '' d definitely get to the bottom of that issue tomorrow morning ."
"he didn '' t like her working herself so hard that she became comatose the moment she saw him ."
"unsatisfied , dharr carefully unsnapped her jeans , then pulled them gently off her , revealing her soft , creamy skin ."
"he almost groaned when he saw her black lace underwear ."
"it was the first underwear he '' d had her try on last weekend ."
"curiosity won over and , instead of being the gentleman , he unbuttoned her sweater and slipped that off as well ."
"sure enough , her full , heavy breasts were encased , barely , in the matching black lace bra ."
"dharr gritted his teeth , already aching to be inside her , to feel her soft body wrap around his length ."
"soon , he thought ."
"he '' d give her a few hours of sleep , then wake her later ."
"he pulled the blanket up over her curves , shut off the light and walked out of the bedroom ."
"spending the evening on the phone was not how he '' d planned on spending his evening ."
"especially since most of his concentration was on her instead of the conversations ."
"electra woke up with the sun shining brightly on her face ."
"trying to throw her arm over eyes didn '' t help so instead , she wiggled away , toward the source of heat she '' d found ."
"not wanting to wake up just yet , she sighed softly , curving her body towards the furnace ."
"she felt as well as heard dharr '' s laughter ."
"`` oh , no you don '' t , lovely lady , '' he said and pulled her more firmly against him , rolling over so her soft body was pinned underneath him ."
"his head bent to nuzzle her neck , finishing the process of waking her up ."
"`` dharr ! ''"
"she gasped , pulling her arms out from underneath her and grabbing onto his broad shoulders ."
"`` that '' s a much better response , '' he murmured and moved on to her shoulder , nibbling and kissing his way down to her nipple ."
"`` what happened last night ? ''"
"she asked , smiling and arching into his mouth and hands ."
"`` you fell asleep on me . ''"
"his hands were everywhere , making her moan softly as he rediscovered each small area of her body that was sensitive to his touch ."
"`` don '' t let that happen again , '' he growled when his fingers reached between her legs and discovered how ready she was for him ."
"electra couldn '' t hide her reaction and when his fingers found her core , she whimpered , needing something other than his fingers inside her ."
"`` stop teasing , dharr , '' she said harshly , her mouth falling open as sensations ripped through her body ."
"`` please , no more ! ''"
"she almost yelled ."
"`` you made me wait , '' he said and moved his fingers slightly ."
"`` i don '' t like waiting . ''"
"`` sorry , '' she said , her nails digging into his shoulder ."
"`` you should have woken me up . ''"
"`` you were too tired , '' he said and pulled his hand away ."
"only to replace it with himself ."
"her heat welcomed him and electra moved slightly , trying to accommodate his size , forcing her body to relax ."
"when he was fully inside her , she looked up at him , licking her dry lips and smiling ."
"`` i missed you too , '' she said and moved her hips the way he '' d taught her , enjoying the surprise that streaked across his face ."
"dharr was stunned at how much their bodies worked together ."
"being inside this slender beauty felt as if he was coming home ."
"he didn '' t like that feeling ."
"it shocked too many of his beliefs onto the floor ."
"needing to gain control , he slipped his arm underneath her hips and rolled her over , trapping her legs to the side of his hips ."
"`` wrap your legs around me , '' he commanded ."
"electra '' s eyes widened with the new position ."
"she could already feel her body tightening , the sensations stronger and it scared her ."
"`` no , '' she gasped ."
"`` wrap them , ellie , '' he ordered and moved once again , enjoying how her head fell backwards ."
"`` do it . ''"
"ellie couldn '' t ignore him any longer ."
"her body was poised and she knew he wouldn '' t let her have what she needed until she followed his orders ."
"despite her better judgment , she complied , then almost screamed as the pleasure coursed through her when his body moved ."
"`` dharr ! ''"
"she cried out , her head thrashing back and forth on the bed ."
"her hands could only clench the sheets , unable to reach him from this position ."
"he was completely in control and the feelings of helplessness only increased the pleasure ."
"in the end , when the climaxed finally took her body , she wasn '' t able to control herself ."
"her voice screamed out , over and over again as he took her to a pinnacle that she '' d never dreamed possible ."
"and when her body had finally calmed , her nerves , her muscles and even her bones melting into the soft mattress , she couldn '' t even form the words to thank himfor what he '' d done to her ."
"she was simply too weak to speak ."
"so when he pulled her close and held her as she fell back to sleep , she showed him in the only way she knew how what she was feeling ."
"she curled her body up against his , her mouth kissing him gently on the neck before sleep once again took her into its soft escape ."
"it was past lunchtime when she woke up again ."
"looking around , she saw that the bed was in complete turmoil , the blanket and sheets completely dislodged from the mattress and only one pillow still on the bed ."
"she was pretty sure the pillows against the wall were her doing , having been thrown out of the way when she needed to become one with that man ."
"`` your awake , '' a deep voice said from the doorway ."
"electra looked across the room , her face immediately turning bright red when she saw the satisfied look on his face ."
"the smile turned sexy as he walked toward her , his jeans hugging his hips and the turtleneck hugging his bulging muscles ."
"`` i '' m awake , '' she repeated , pulling the sheet more firmly around her naked breasts ."
"he leaned down to kiss her ."
"`` are you hungry ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra realized that she was famished ."
"she '' d missed both lunch and dinner yesterday , too upset and exhausted to eat anything ."
"then she '' d obviously slept through breakfast today ."
"`` yes ."
"i '' m very hungry , '' she answered , her eyes looking at his chin , unable to meet his eyes ."
"she heard his laughter and glanced up ."
"`` what '' s so funny ? ''"
"she asked , wanting to reach out and touch him but too embarrassed bywhat they '' d done earlier ."
"`` you are , '' he responded , a finger reaching out to touch her cheek ."
"`` and you '' re perfectly pink skin , eyes that can '' t meet mine and your delectable body which you '' re trying to hide underneath that sheet . ''"
"he let his gaze travel down to her breasts , seeing how her nipples puckered through the sheet ."
"`` you '' re sweet , and beautiful ."
"and i can '' t wait to get you to do that with me again . ''"
"electra sucked in a deep breath ."
"`` again ? ''"
"she asked , already her body responding ."
"`` you mean , you don '' t think ... '' she started to ask him if he '' d thought worse of her for participating in such a daring sexual position but he stopped her by placing a finger over her mouth ."
"`` don '' t say another word . ''"
"he said ."
"`` there '' s nothing wrong with what we sh are in this bed ."
"you '' re a very passionate woman and i '' m grateful you '' re willing to share that passion with me . ''"
"there weren '' t many things that would have made her feel better , but his words did the trick ."
"she smiled tentatively up at him ."
"`` really ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` really , '' he replied , holding back his laughter as he saw the relief break through her features ."
"`` now , how about some food , then we can hit the slopes . ''"
"he pulled her up and carried her to the bathroom ."
"`` unless you '' d like a repeat performance right now , '' he said as he released her legs and saw her body ."
"electra immediately grabbed a towel and covered her front ."
"`` i think i could use a shower , '' she said and took a step away , needing just a little space to get her thoughts together ."
"the past fortyeight hours , she '' d felt as if she '' d been on an emotional roller coaster ."
"he chuckled and ignored her backward step , pulling her into his arms and kissing her ."
"`` i like the back view just as much as the front , '' he said a moment before he released her and walked out of the bathroom ."
"electra didn '' t understand until she turned slightly and saw the huge mirror ."
"she '' d covered her front , but he '' d had a full view of her bottom in the mirror ."
"she took only a few minutes in the shower since the warm water and scented soap rubbing along her body only reminded her of how incredible dharr '' s lovemaking turned out to be ."
"he was a master and she felt as if her body were slipping out of control ."
"even a shower now was turning her on and all she could think about was how fast she could get back to him , be with him , make love with him ."
"what had happened to the need for a little space ?"
"grabbing the towel again in self disgust , she toweled herself dry , then wrapped herself in it , padding barefoot to the bedroom ."
"all of her clothes had been unpacked but she found a pair of jeans , long sleeved tee-shirt and sexy underwear already out for her ."
"she suspected that dharr had chosen this ensemble since the underwear was red ."
"slipping into the clothes , she thought hard about what was going on , what her body needed and what her mind could take ."
"was she setting herself up for heartache by having this affair with dharr ?"
"and she didn '' t even shy away from that word ."
"that '' s exactly what she was having ."
"it was a mind-blowing affair with a powerful , overwhelming , handsome man of the world ."
"everything they '' d done together , both in and out of bed , had been so much more than she '' d anticipated ."
"her self-introspection was going to have to wait though ."
"her stomach growled and electra acknowledged that she couldn '' t put off eating any longer , no matter how much her mind told her she needed space to think things through ."
"opening the door to the bedroom , she walked into the great room and eventually found dharr seated in an overstuffed sofa watching hockey ."
"he smiled when she walked up and within moments , a large tray of food was brought to her ."
"there was fragrant chili with all the fixings and a large pan of corn bread ."
"`` chili ? ''"
"she laughed , stunned by the lunch offerings ."
"`` i never would have thought you '' d like such an american meal . ''"
"her stomach was too demanding to care about anything at the moment but filling it so she leaned forward and filled a bowl , added sour cream and cheese , then leaned back in the sofa , tucking her feet underneath her before tasting the delicious smelling meal ."
"`` oh , this is delicious . ''"
"`` i '' m glad you like it ."
"it '' s one of my favorite meals whenever i go skiing . ''"
"`` have you been out to the slopes yet ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` nope ."
"i '' ve been waiting for you . ''"
"that shocked her ."
"`` i '' m so sorry !"
"you should have gone while i was sleeping . ''"
"`` i waited ."
"and the wait was well compensated , '' he grinned wickedly ."
"`` i don '' t feel deprived inany way . ''"
"they ate , talked , skied and made love for the rest of the we ekend ."
"electra wasn '' t surprised when she flew back to london without ever speaking to another soul besides dharr ."
"nor did she have any desire to ."
"it was as if their weekends together were special and needed to be packed with only the two of them ."
"and everywhere they went , he would touch her or kiss her , to the point that , midway down one run during a break , he pulled her off to the side so they were hidden by the trees and kissed her till she was senseless ."
"he was ruthless in his passion that weekend , showing her in so many ways how much she had to learn about sex and relationships ."
"chapter 8 `` do you like the apartment ? ''"
"dharr asked , his hand skimming down electra '' s spine making her wiggle ."
"`` yes , '' she sighed , closing her eyes as her body came awake ."
"`` it '' s beautiful . ''"
"they were back in the paris apartment a month after their skiing trip ."
"the month had been full of wonder and anticipation as she met dharr in all sorts of cities ."
"she '' d never traveled to so many places in her life , nor had she spent so much money ."
"she '' d definitely dented her bank account meeting him in all the exotic places ."
"not that he would allow her to pay for anything once they arrived ."
"in fact , money was never even mentioned nor seen ."
"everything seemed to be paid for in advance ."
"private museum tours , operas , ballets , dinners at exclusive restaurants , touring the countryside , all of it was mysteriously and anonymously arranged as if by magic ."
"it was a little disconcerting when electra stopped to think about it but , since dharr rarely allowed her time to think when he was around , she hadn '' t considered too many angles of their time together ."
"`` when can you move in ? ''"
"he asked , his hand slipping around to the front of her , capturing a nipple between his fingers ."
"electra laughed ."
"`` i don '' t like it that much , '' she said and squirmed around so she was facing him ."
"`` why would i move in here ?"
"the commute would kill me , '' she said teasingly ."
"she barely heard his sigh , but it was there nonetheless ."
"`` you '' re going to have to quit your job , ellie ."
"you don '' t make enough money to justify working , much less all the time you put into those kids ."
"besides , i want you to focus only on me , '' he said , his rough face bending to nuzzle her neck ."
"his words chilled electra and she pulled away , enough so that she could look at his face ."
"she didn '' t really like what she saw ."
"`` what are you saying ? ''"
"she asked , trying to control her temper and not make any assumptions about what he was asking of her ."
"her grandmother would be proud because six weeks ago , she would have already been livid , pulling away and running as fast as she could the other way ."
"he stopped kissing her neck , realizing she was serious about her confusion ."
"looking down into her eyes , he smiled , sure that the idea of becoming his mistress would be thrilling to her ."
"`` i want you to move in here ."
"i '' ll visit you as often as i can but while i '' m not here , you '' ll have plenty of money to entertain you . ''"
"electra pulled away even further and sat up , fully awake and pushing the desire he '' d stoked to the side ."
"`` just to be clear , you want me to quit my job that i just started a few weeks ago , move to a strange country into an apartment i don '' t own and be at your beck and call for whenever you deign to visit me ."
"do i have that straight ? ''"
"she asked with a tightness in her chest she '' d never felt around him ."
"their time together was always special and filled with romance and heated passion ."
"controversial subjects were immediately pushed to the side , both of them knowing they had too little time together to waste it on arguments ."
"dharr laughed and pulled her down so she was underneath him again , his body covering hers in order to suppress her angry movements ."
"`` you make it sound worse than it is ."
"but think of all the nights we '' d have just like last night , '' he suggested ."
"electra was having none of that ."
"she pulled herself out from underneath him , dragging the sheet behind her and climbing out of bed ."
"`` in other words , you want me to become your mistress , is that right ? ''"
"she asked , her temper on full boil now ."
"dharr sighed and stood up next to her , completely naked but unconcerned about it ."
"`` is there something wrong with that term ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` besides being the ultimate insult to any woman you offer it to ? ''"
"she almost yelled ."
"his offer had hurt her more than she was willing to admit and she hoped she could hide her pain from him ."
"he wanted her to become his mistress !"
"there was a huge difference between having an affair with him and becoming his mistress ."
"there was an equality issue she wasn '' t willing to delve into ."
"`` do you have so little respect for me and what i want out of life that you could offer me nothing better than to be a ... . ''"
"she struggled for a way to describe his offer , `` an employee ?"
"a prostitute ? ''"
"she finally spit out ."
"`` is that what i am to you ?"
"is that what you think of me ? ''"
"she asked , her voice going from an almost yell to one of horror ."
"she backed away several steps , not wanting him to touch her ."
"he put his hands on his hips as he watched her face turn angry and hurt ."
"this wasn '' t going at all as he '' d anticipated their conversation going ."
"in the past , the women he '' d set up in this apartment were all thrilled with the arrangements ."
"but then , he was talking to ellie and she '' d never done the expected ."
"`` it isn '' t like that , '' he said , his anger rising to the surface ."
"`` you know we '' re good together ."
"what '' s wrong with making the situation more convenient for both of us ? ''"
"he suggested , his tone coaxing and he reached for her arms , about to pull her into his arms and carry her back to bed where they communicated more effectively ."
"she quickly shied away from his touch , twisting around and backing up several more steps ."
"`` don '' t touch me !"
"i '' m not a ... '' she couldn '' t finish her sentence ."
"she looked around , newly aware of her surroundings ."
"then a thought struck her ."
"`` was there another woman here before me ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"the look in his eyes told her everything she needed to know ."
"`` uh ! ''"
"she groaned , hiding her face in her hands as the realization came that she was just another in a long line of women ."
"`` i '' m just the next one , aren '' t i ? ''"
"she looked around ."
"`` i '' m not anything more than your next whore !"
"how long was it between women ? ''"
"dharr started to say something , not even venturing to tell her the truth but ran his fingers through his hair in frustration ."
"`` that '' s not the point ."
"and don '' t ever call yourself a whore again ! ''"
"`` it '' s exactly the point , '' she countered angrily ."
"`` and let '' s just call things by their appropriate name and not beat around the bush ."
"you '' re offering to put me up in this apartment , give me an allowance and in return , all you expect of me is sex ."
"am i missing something ? ''"
"she demanded angrily ."
"`` if that '' s not the definition of a whore , i '' m not sure what it would be ! ''"
"`` you '' re being ridiculous , '' he countered , turning back to pull on a pair of jeans ."
"`` a whore works off the street and sells her body . ''"
"electra wiped a tear angrily from her cheek before she replied , `` you '' re just discussing geography . ''"
"`` you '' re being overly sensitive ."
"i don '' t think of you in that way and i never have ."
"so don '' t put labels on something that isn '' t there . ''"
"electra looked around the room again , noting the romantic slant to the decorating , the extra big bed and all the lovely skin lotions that had been in the bathroom when she '' d arrived for the first time six weeks ago ."
"`` i can '' t believe this !"
"i '' m just your next mistress , '' she said ."
"it was no longer a question but a statement ."
"her eyes were vulnerable when she turned to face him once again ."
"`` in my mind , you '' ve shown me everything , given me so much pleasure i actually ache duringthe nights we '' re not together ."
"but to you i '' m not even important enough in your life to warrant anything more than ... '' she stopped the words , afraid of what she '' d say ."
"she turned to look at him , the hurt and humiliation shining through in her eyes ."
"but instead of arguing any longer , she turned and walked into the bathroom , ignoring him when he called her to stop ."
"`` ellie , this is ridiculous ."
"you '' re completely misinterpreting my offer . ''"
"in response , she walked faster into the bathroom , slamming and locking the door behind her ."
"she showered quickly and took the robe down from the back of the door , wrapping it around her from neck to almost her ankles ."
"she didn '' t know if he would still be out in the bedroom , but right now , all she wanted to do was get as far away from him as possible ."
"when she walked back in , she didn '' t see him anywhere and ignored the stab of disappointment ."
"she dressed in a pair of jeans and light sweater , pulling on tennis shoes and simply tying her hair back in a pony tail , uncaring how messy she looked ."
"all she wanted to do was leave here and get back home , lick her wounds and start to forget this horrible weekend ."
"with his words and his assumption that she would be grateful for the exalted position as his mistress , hehad tarnished what they shared , all that she '' d thought of himand everything she '' d thought about their relationship ."
"as she stuffed clothes into her suitcase , she laughed harshly and had to wipe the tears away from her cheek ."
"relationship ?"
"what relationship , she asked herself ."
"to him , she wasn '' t a woman with feelings and intelligence who had something to offer him ."
"she was a body , a convenience ."
"she was a plaything , she thought with horror ."
"`` why are you crying ? ''"
"he asked , fully dressed in yet another immaculately tailored suit ."
"gone were the casual slacks and open neck shirts and back in place was the business man ."
"electra reached up and wiped her cheeks , surprised to find her fingers come away with wetness ."
"`` because you hurt me , '' she said , uncaring what he thought about her now ."
"`` i don '' t see how my wish for you to be with me when it is possible would be painful to you , '' he grated out , anger flaring for the first time since she '' d known him ."
"electra shook her head , wishing she could just walk out ."
"but the past few days had been too wonderful and her feet would not take her out of the apartment ."
"her bag was packed , her tickets and passport in her hand but something held her back ."
"she glanced at him over her shoulder , seeing him casually leaning against the door frame ."
"he had no idea what he '' d done to her pride ."
"no one had ever asked him to ... ."
"her mind stopped immediately and considered her last thought ."
"no one had ever offered him the same suggestion , the same opportunity ."
"he couldn '' t know how insulting his offer was because he '' d been insulated from the real world ."
"but she could change that , she thought wryly ."
"she had pride and she wasn '' t going to go down without a fight ."
"what they '' d shared deserved at least that she try to make him understand what a horrible situation being a mistress would be ."
"wiping her cheeks , she straightened her shoulders and turned to face him , one shoulder dropping slightly , her tongue sticking out with sexual provocation as she surveyed his appearance once again ."
"`` you know , you might not have such a bad idea , '' she started off , crossing her arms over her stomach and walking around him , looking him up and down as if he were an object ."
"`` you know , i have quite a bit of money myself , but i like my job a lot . ''"
"`` i think i can understand your perspective now . ''"
"dharr '' s body reacted to both her newly sensuous pose as well as the come hither look in her eyes ."
"if he was a little disappointed that she '' d accepted his offer , well , that was to be expected ."
"he '' d liked her being different ."
"but only during special moments , he reminded himself ."
"now that she '' d become the expected , perhaps he would be able to work her out of his system ."
"normalcy , he thought ."
"that '' s what he needed ."
"and now things were back on track ."
"her next words blew him away ."
"`` i like your suggestion but with a twist if you don '' t mind . ''"
"he pushed away from the doorway and moved toward her ."
"`` name it ."
"it '' s yours . ''"
"`` shouldn '' t you be more cautious of your promises ? ''"
"she teased ."
"dharr was instantly erect and all he wanted was to get this conversation over with so he could toss her back onto the bed and make love to her ."
"`` i can honestly say there isn '' t much you could ask for that i could not deliverto you . ''"
"her smile should have given him warning but he was concentrating on the vulnerability , and the lingering hurt still in her eyes ."
"`` like i said , your suggestion definitely has merit but let '' s turn it around ."
"how about if you quit your job and move to london ?"
"i '' m usually finished with the kids by late afternoon and could come visit you as soon as i '' m done ."
"except on the nights when i need to work late . ''"
"she tapped the side of her chin as if considering all the conditions ."
"`` or research lesson plans ."
"or set up the ideas for the next day ."
"but you understand how busy work can get , don '' t you ?"
"and what '' s more , you won '' t need to work anymore ."
"i '' m sure that we can find something you '' ll like just as much as your job if we just put our minds to it . ''"
"dharr stared at her , her words not making any sense ."
"`` are you saying you '' re willing to become my mistress if i set up an apartment in london instead of paris ? ''"
"he couldn '' t believe it was that easy ."
"`` consider it done , '' he said and walked more quickly across the room , his mind instantly filling with ideas on what he wanted to do to her delectable body encased in those horrible jeans ."
"he '' d toss them out and forbid her to wear them ever again ."
"he preferred her in silks and satins , or nothing at all ."
"`` now , hold on , sailor , '' she teased , putting up a hand to stop his forward advance ."
"`` i '' m not sure you understand where i '' m going with this , '' she said ."
"`` i don '' t want an apartment in london.there '' s a really beautiful house down the street from me and i could put you up there ."
"not you putting me up somewhere ."
"like i said a moment ago , i might be busy some nights , and , of course during the day , i '' d have to work , but there '' s lots of things to do.and i '' m sure there are some of the moms around town who could give you tips on what to do during the day . ''"
"she didn '' t look at his eyes , knowing she wouldn '' t be able to continue if she saw the look in his eyes ."
"but she raised one finger so it touched the side of her face , as if considering something very deeply ."
"`` you '' ll need credit cards , of course ."
"don '' t worry , honey , i can put you up in style ."
"the weekdays i '' ll be pretty busy , but the weekends , well , let '' s just see what happens , shall we ? ''"
"dharr stared at the slip of a woman who continuously threw him out of the expected ."
"`` what are you suggesting , ellie ? ''"
"he asked , moving toward her menacingly ."
"she wasn '' t afraid of him ."
"she stood her ground and challenged him ."
"`` honey , i can '' t believe you don '' t understand ."
"i need you ."
"we need each other ."
"it '' s just who '' s convenience we '' re talking about . ''"
"she stared at him with wide eyed innocence and waited for his answer or reaction ."
"her shoulders were tense with anticipation and she didn '' t have long to wait ."
"the expressions that crossed his face were fascinating ."
"they started off with confusion , then a realization of what she was proposing , or more importantly , propositioning ."
"when he finally understood , when her words sunk in , amusement hit him full force ."
"he threw back his head and laughed , holding his sides as his mirth took over and he had to hold the side of the door in order to balance himself ."
"when he was finally able to control his laughter , he took a deep breath and looked down at her , his hands gentle on her shoulders ."
"`` let me get this straight ."
"you '' re suggesting that i leave my work behind , move into a house near london and become your mistress ? ''"
"electra shrugged delicately but nodded , `` or whatever the male equ ivalent is ."
"but don '' t worry , dharr ."
"i '' ll stop by as often as possible ."
"i promise you won '' t get bored ."
"there are plenty of shops you can spend money in and we can take lots of trips when i '' m free ."
"you can spend your days getting spruced up for me ."
"won '' t that be fun ? ''"
"her words only made him chuckle again ."
"`` i can '' t believe you ."
"i don '' t know of another female who would ever propose such a thing to me , '' he said ."
"she reached up and patted his cheek ."
"`` there '' s a first time for everything , isn '' t there , honey ? ''"
"she replied ."
"`` so what '' s your answer ? ''"
"he pulled her closer , hugging her agains t his strong body ."
"`` yes , there certainly is ."
"so i '' m assuming from your response , that you don '' t like the idea of becoming my mistress ."
"is that correct ? ''"
"she was still stiff , but at least she wasn '' t pushing him away ."
"dharr considered that a victory in this situation and with this woman ."
"damn !"
"she constantly fascinated him !"
"`` how would you like it ?"
"i mean , really , it is sort of like being a doll that someone takes out and plays with whenever it is convenient for them ."
"not a very equal relationship , is it ? ''"
"she suggested ."
"dharr shook his head ."
"equality had never been in any of his relationships , male or female , and he '' d never even assumed that word would come into play in his dealings with women ."
"but that only showed him that this one was different from the others ."
"he '' d known that all along , but it was interesting to be proven right once again ."
"`` point taken ."
"how would you define our relationship ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she tilted her head to the side and considered all the possibilities ."
"`` how about lovers ? ''"
"she offered , terrified that he might reject something so intimate ."
"but he considered it , mulling the word around in his mind for a moment ."
"`` lovers , '' he suggested ."
"`` does that mean i '' ll have to send you a birthday card ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra laughed , instantly relieved that he hadn '' t rejected the idea ."
"`` yes ."
"if we '' re still together when my birthday rolls around , you '' d better send me a birthday card ."
"and a valentine '' s day card as well ."
"and i might just want a big box of chocolates , but i '' ll let you know ."
"and if you '' re a very good boy , you might just get a birthday card yourself , '' she said , her eyes peeping out at him from under her lashes ."
"`` and something special on valentine '' s day . ''"
"dharr pulled her closer and laughed as well ."
"`` it sounds like a deal , '' he said ."
"`` but does this mean i can '' t order you around the world and have you at my beck and call ? ''"
"he asked , his hand slipping under her shirt to cup her breast , his thumb flicking across her nipple underneath the lace of her bra ."
"electra gasped as his fingers controlled her body and shivered , then smiled shyly up at him , a promise of retribution in her eyes ."
"`` well , depends on the timing ."
"i '' ll agree that i don '' t make as much money as you do , nor will i ever ."
"but that doesn '' t diminish the importance of what i do and what all the kids mean to me ."
"i '' m guessing that a lot of people depend upon you and that all the companies , or whatever you run , need you at their helm to guide them ."
"and those kids i teach each day need me , even though i '' m only anassistant teacher ."
"those children mean something to me . ''"
"dharr nodded his head ."
"`` accepted . ''"
"she slipped her arms around his shoulders , her fingers diving into his hair and touching the back of his neck , knowing how much he liked that ."
"`` i don '' t have much to do on the weekends so if you '' d like to get together next weekend , i think something can be arranged , '' she replied , her body pressing against his in the hopes that he might make their last few hours together this weekend more memorable ."
"`` deal . ''"
"without another word , he picked her up and tossed her over his shoulder ."
"electra screamed and laughed as he bounced her along to the bedroom , then tossed her onto the bed ."
"she laughed as she looked up at him , stunned by how quickly he was divesting himself of his suit and tie ."
"`` what are you doing ?"
"you look like you have to go to a meeting or something so surely you don '' t have time for this kind of silliness , dharr , '' she said , raising herself up on her elbows as she watched him toss his belt over his shoulder ."
"`` later , '' he growled ."
"`` i have a lover who thinks she can order me around , '' he said softly , pulling her leg up and rubbing his thumbs against her instep ."
"`` i plan to counter that idea in her silly head before it becomes an issue . ''"
"electra gasped out a laugh ."
"she '' d never known her foot could be so erogenous ."
"`` what are you doing ? ''"
"she asked moments before her head fell back , her hair cascading behind her in a waterfall against the sheets ."
"`` never mind , i don '' t care what you '' re doing as long asyou don '' t stop . ''"
"`` i can go along with that , '' he said , his fingers moving from her foot to her calf muscle ."
"by the time he entered her , there was not a muscle in her body that was tense ."
"chapter 9 electra glanced up at the principal behind her ."
"`` hello , gloria ."
"how are you ? ''"
"she asked brightly before glancing down at the student '' s work she was grading ."
"`` the children have really taken off on their spelling lately ."
"i '' ve seen some definite improvements , '' she said ."
"gloria chuckled softly ."
"`` i don '' t doubt it is mostly because of your songs you '' ve put all the words to , '' she replied ."
"electra had come up with different songs which taught the children how to spell some of the most often used english words ."
"it reinforced the spelling in their heads , sort of a twist on memorization ."
"she cleared her throat and electra looked up again , noting the worried expression on her supervisor '' s face ."
"`` is something wrong ? ''"
"electra asked , panic starting to inch its way into her heart ."
"she didn '' t like that look ."
"on her grandmother , it usually portended bad news ."
"she hesitated slightly , then took the newspaper out from under her arm ."
"`` have you seen the dailies yet ? ''"
"she asked ."
"the woman looked genuinely embarrassed to be holding a gossip rag ."
"`` i mean , i know this is just a silly gossip paperand i '' d usually never be caught dead purchasing one , but the picture on the cover caught my eye at the grocery store earlier.i thought you '' d need to see it , if you haven '' t already . ''"
"electra shook her head , hiding a smile from her boss ."
"`` i don '' t generally read them unless some woman gives birth to an alien dog , '' she joked as she took the offered newsprint and glanced down at the front cover ."
"`` what '' s so interesting in there ? ''"
"she asked , humoring her boss as she glanced at the back of the page , stifling a shudder when she caught sight of an advertisement for rock collecting ."
"when she turned the paper so she could see the front page clearly , she gasped in shock , almost dropping the paper in her effort to get it as far away from her without dropping it ."
"`` oh my goodness ! ''"
"she cried out , automatically standing up as her eyes focused on the two people kissing on the side of the mountain in ski outfits ."
"the tall man had dark hair and sunglasses on ."
"the woman had long , black hair that fell almost to her derriere because of the way her head was tilted back for the kiss ."
"her eyes were closed , but there was no disputing the face ."
"it was her and she had her arms wrapped around dharr '' s neck ."
"the caption read , `` who '' s the king '' s new love interest ?"
"a search for the mystery woman ongoing . ''"
"`` it can '' t be , '' electra cried out , her hands accidentally crumpling the edge of the newspaper as they inadvertently balled into fists ."
"`` not him ! ''"
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"gloria asked ."
"`` you mean the king ? ''"
"gloria moved closer , putting a reassuring hand on electra '' s shoulder ."
"`` dear , what '' s going on ?"
"are you really dating king abbas ?"
"is that you in the picture ? ''"
"electra couldn '' t answer , the pain of his betrayal too great ."
"she '' d been having a n affair with king abbas ?"
"that was impossible ."
"there must be some mistake , some error in recognizing the man in the picture ."
"dharr was a real estate developer ."
"wasn '' t he ?"
"he couldn '' t be a king , and definitely not the king of one of the wealthiest countries in the arab world !"
"she quickly turned the pages to the article and almost dropped the paper ."
"there were pictures from paris , switzerland and even london on the night they '' d met ."
"how in the world had they recognized him so quickly ?"
"had these pictures been floating in the tabloids all this time and she '' d just never heard about them ?"
"`` how long have they been speculating on my identity ? ''"
"she asked , terrified of the answer but needing to know ."
"she had to know everything in order to figure out what she should do ."
"this was all so incredible , she was stunned ."
"no , horrified was a better word ."
"`` well , i '' ve seen small blurbs about it occasionally for the past several weeks but i never bothered to pick up the paper ."
"i only read the front page when i '' m paying for my groceries , '' she clarified , apparently worried that electra might think she read these kinds of rags on a regular basis ."
"`` but when i saw your picture kissing that gorgeous man , well , i just had to buy it , '' she laughed self-consciously ."
"the woman was settling in for a good gossip , unaware or just unconcerned that electra '' s heart was about to break into two ."
"`` i knew you '' d been dating someone , but a king ? ''"
"she asked , emphasizing the last word ."
"`` what '' s he like in real life ?"
"he looks absolutely scrumptious , '' she said ."
"electra shook her head in denial ."
"`` he '' s awful ! ''"
"she cried out , pain and betrayal taking over ."
"there was no small amount of humiliation as well ."
"some of these pictures were very compromising ."
"she '' d had no idea cameras had beenso near ."
"she hadn '' t seen them anywhere but even if she had , she '' d have assumed the people taking the pictures were just tourists trying to get a sunset or pretty mountain scene ."
"there would be no need to take a picture of either of them , if he '' d been who he '' d said he was ."
"she ignored the fact that she hadn '' t given dharr her real name ."
"that was irrelevant in this situation ."
"he '' d lied to her and told her that he was buying buildings and land and such ."
"whenever they talked about their weeks to each other , he would tell her about meetings with boring old men and people who disagreed with him or people who were trying to sell him something ."
"never had the concept of royalty been brought up ."
"then another thought struck her ."
"this one was so much more horrifying than the last , she actually had trouble breathing ."
"she glanced at the name in the text ."
"blinking , she read the passages again , sure that the world was not really as cruel as it was beginning to seem ."
"but no matter how hard she focused , the name didn '' t change ."
"the words she read over and over again still formed the name `` king dharr abass '' ."
"the horror of it struck her like a knife wound and her knees almost feel out from underneath her ."
"she was having an affair with her guardian !"
"the man who had made her life miserable for the previous eight years and wouldn '' t even return her calls now at her continued request for a simple meeting !"
"the gall of the man !"
"a tear slipped from her eye and she swiped it away angrily ."
"she didn '' t want her boss to see how much the article affected her but since she was sitting on a tiny chair crying , there wasn '' t much use pretending any longer ."
"she wanted to run and hide and then tear up the newsprint as if that kind of violence would help her ease the pain tearing up her insides ."
"could this get any worse ?"
"she couldn '' t imagine how ."
"she was just about to turn around when she saw something flash out of the corner of her eye ."
"she didn '' t understand what the flash meant initially , but as her shock frozen brain started working slightly , the situation crystallized in her head ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she gasped and stood up , moving backwards to the relative safety of the book case , hiding herself from the windows ."
"`` this can '' t be happening ! ''"
"were photographers now stalking her around the school ?"
"had they found out where she was working ?"
"how could that be possible ?"
"the article had been dated just yesterday and the reporter was saying how the king '' s lover was still a mystery woman ."
"but the reality of the photographers , just like the horror that she '' d been dating a man who had lied to her by omission and that man was her hated guardian , just added to the increasing tension in the room ."
"so many strangers around the school building might hurt the children ."
"the kids wouldn '' t understand why so many people were trying to taketheir teacher '' s picture ."
"and some of the kids might get hurt in the melee if the photographers were as merciless as they were starting to appear ."
"she had to hide , to get out of here ."
"but where ?"
"how ?"
"her mind worked frantically but each time she considered one escape route , she '' d see another group of journalists rushing in that direction ."
"just then , gerrard burst into the room ."
"`` this way , '' he said urgently ."
"`` we have to leave out the back door ."
"there are photographers all over the place . ''"
"the expression on his face more than his words broke through her hurt and confusion ."
"she followed his orders simply because she had no better ideas ."
"and her mind couldn '' t function fast enough to figure one out anyway ."
"electra grabbed her purse , immediately moving into quick action ."
"she stopped only a moment before she turned to gloria and said , `` please , don '' t say anything to the press about me ."
"ask the others to keep things quiet as well ."
"i don '' t understand what '' s going on and what they want from me ."
"it would mean a lot to me , '' she said , her eyes pleading with the older woman ."
"gloria put a reassuring hand on electra '' s arm and nodded forcefully ."
"`` absolutely , '' gloria replied quickly , her eyes wide with worry for both her school and for electra ."
"`` we would never do anything to jeopardize the children or one of the staff members and these photographers would definitely do that ."
"i also know your privacy is important , as it is to all of us ."
"we won '' t disrespect that . ''"
"`` thank you , '' she said before gerrard pulled her impatiently by the arm through the door ."
"they almost ran down the hallway and burst out the back door , electra diving into a waiting limousine only moments before a cameraman started banging on the dark window ."
"he took several pictures but electra was grateful for the tinted glass which prevented them from seeing anything inside the security of the car ."
"`` where did they come from ? ''"
"she asked gerrard who was sitting next to her talking on a cell phone in arabic ."
"she was staring out the window as she watched several other photographers start to race up the sidewalk towardthe building ."
"`` and who are the other men stopping them ? ''"
"she asked when she noticed large , muscular men physically stopping the photographers from entering the school ."
"gerrard watched in approval as the guards effectively stopped the stampeding paparazzi ."
"`` they were sent by king abbass to protect your co-workers and students from being harassed , '' he explained , not bothering to stop or turn his head in her direction ."
"his main goal was to get her out of the building and the area safely and quickly ."
"electra sniffed and tried to hide her tears ."
"`` that was very considerate of him , '' she said ."
"`` i didn '' t know he knew where i worked , '' she said ."
"the limousine was racing through the streets of london now and electra had to hang on tightly as the car turned corners at a speed that would have brought police out in force if anyone else was doing it ."
"the driver finally pulled to a stop outside an elegant building that looked vaguely familiar but her mind wasn '' t working fast enough to be able to figure out where gerrard had taken her ."
"he stepped out of the car first and looked around before indicating she could leave the relative security as well ."
"he pulled an unmarked door open and stuffed her through it , slamming it shut behind him then pushing her down the hallway again ."
"`` gerrard , you '' re not answering my questions , '' she said and dug her feet in to stop their forward momentum ."
"`` and i '' m not going anywhere else until you tell me what '' s going on.where '' s dharr ?"
"does he know what '' s going on ? ''"
"he was obviously reluctant to say anything but his eyes scanned the hallway as he said , `` he found out the same way the journalists did , '' he said , accepting that answering her question was the only way to get her to move again , other than tossing her over his shoulder and carrying her to safety ."
"`` ah , '' she replied , as if that explained everything ."
"but it didn '' t. she was still confused but she sensed that there was still some danger so she started moving again ."
"unfortunately , nothing really made sense ."
"it was as if the world had flipped over on it '' s side and this mad dash to some unknown destination was scaring her more than the journalists , which was saying a lot ."
"within moments , gerrard pushed her out a side door and into a limousine that was already at the end of the sidewalk , the back door open and ready for her to dive into the dark sanctuary ."
"`` where are we going ? ''"
"she asked breathlessly ."
"`` the other limousine was being followed ."
"i '' m trying to get you to a new one that they don '' t know about . ''"
"electra understood and walked faster , following his directions as he took her through the building and out a side door ."
"regrettably , their ruse didn '' t work ."
"as soon as they '' d burst through a side door , the photographers were waiting for her ."
"the only good part was that they had their backs to the door she had just left so gerrard hurried her to the car ."
"the photographers spotted her seconds before the door slammed shut behind her ."
"within moments of the door shutting , the car was pulling smoothly away from the curb and she could only stare at the frenzied press that were bearing down on the guards ."
"very efficiently , the guards dharr had sent moved the reporters away from the building ."
"she lost sight of the mass when the limousine turned the corner and she had breathed a sigh of relief that she hadn '' t been left alone to deal with their madness ."
"she didn '' t notice the passing of the scenery as the car drove through the streets ."
"her mind was frantically trying to make sense out of the situation ."
"she thought back to all the times they '' d been together , trying to figure out if there had been a point in time when he '' d accidentally told her about who he was ."
"her mind raced through all of their encounters , putting the words together again and trying to decipher a different meaning to them ."
"but nothing he '' d said would make her think he was anything other than a wealthy man with varied business interests ."
"she but wasn '' t surprised when the car pulled up outside dharr '' s london building ."
"gerrard held the door open and she noticed micha and sam standing sentry beside the private elevator , their eyes surveying the surroundings , alert to any potential threats ."
"she shook her head as she gazed out from the darkened interior of the limousine ."
"`` i '' m not going in there , '' she said , angrily wiping away the tears that started to fall more heavily ."
"`` your grandmother is upstairs , '' gerrard said carefully ."
"`` and it is not safe out here ."
"not anymore . ''"
"her eyes widened with his comments ."
"`` what do you mean ?"
"why not anymore '' ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"`` what '' s happened between yesterday and now besides me looking like a fool ? ''"
"gerrard '' s eyes clouded over with concern and he shook his head sadly ."
"`` you must come inside , '' he repeated ."
"`` you will understand once his highness explains ."
"it is not my place to discuss this situation with you . ''"
"electra '' s heart contracted slightly when she heard gerrard refer to dharr with a royal title ."
"this wasn '' t fair !"
"none of it was fair !"
"but it wasn '' t real , was it ?"
"she wasn '' t really having an affair with her guardian , who just happened to be a king , who just happened to also be the man who had made her life so miserable for years ."
"this is all some horrible dream that would disappear as soon as she could wake up ."
"huddling in the corner of the large , luxurious vehicle , she stared into the depths of nothing ."
"her grief over the loss of her relationship , or what she thought of as a relationship , was deep and painful ."
"`` please tell me all of this isn '' t really happening , '' she whispered desperately ."
"`` i don '' t want to go up there , gerrard ."
"couldn '' t you please just take me somewhere else ?"
"i promise i '' ll hide until all this mess is cleared up . ''"
"g errard didn '' t even hesitate before shaking his head adamantly ."
"`` i can not disobey orders from the king , '' he explained ."
"in a more gentle tone he said , `` you must confront him and demand answers yourself . ''"
"those were the only words that could have gotten her out of the car ."
"gerrard was right ."
"she did need to demand answers ."
"and she deserved them ."
"she could explain her own deceit easily ."
"what was a name , anyway ?"
"ellie was short for electra and all of her friends , even her grandmother , calls her ellie ."
"it had never occurred to her to tell him her real name , or even her last name so the confusion was innocent ."
"but he '' d lied by not telling her about his title , his responsibilities even when she '' d asked him about what he did for a living and asked repeatedly about his daily activities ."
"all those things were who he was , what made him the man she ... .electra didn '' t finish that thought ."
"with steely determination , she rode up the elevator in silence , trying to figure out how things had gone so wrong when everything had looked so perfect when she '' d woken this morning ."
"when the elevator opened up , she looked across the room , memories of their first night together flooding back to her ."
"she '' d been standing in this exact spot , the green , strapless dress making her feel daring and beautiful ."
"and just as she had that night , she stood staring out at the view , but this time , she wasn '' t really seeing it , the hurt of his betrayal too much to endure at this point ."
"when she spotted him standing off to the side of the living room , she lashed out at him , her hurt and feelings of betrayal were too deep ."
"`` you ! ''"
"she almost yelled ."
"`` i can '' t believe i '' ve been sleeping with youof all people . ''"
"dharr '' s calm expression didn '' t change with her outburst ."
"he turned to edna and bowed slightly ."
"`` if you don '' t mind , i believe your granddaughter and i have some things to discuss ."
"they might be better said in private . ''"
"edna nodded her head politely , hiding her smile from her furious granddaughter ."
"`` absolutely ."
"i '' ll be in the kitchen asking your cook for the recipe to the delicious scones , '' she said and walked quickly toward what electra assumed was the kitchen ."
"when they were alone again , dharr turned to face her ."
"`` you were saying ? ''"
"he prompted , his eyebrows raised in polite inquiry ."
"he didn '' t seem phased by electra '' s anger or embarrassed by her personal outburst ."
"she persevered despite his patronizing attitude ."
"`` don '' t patronize me you egotistical , arrogant bastard ! ''"
"he smiled slightly as if amused by her fury which only made her grit her teeth as her anger inched up several notches ."
"`` i can guarantee that my parents were legitimately married at the time of my conception and birth ."
"but feel free to toss any other insults my way if it will make you feel better . ''"
"crossing her arms over her chest , she glared at him from across the room ."
"`` i hate you ! ''"
"he chuckled and shook his head ."
"`` yes , i can see that ."
"i '' m not exactly sure why since i believe you '' ve been lying to me about your identity this whole time ."
"perhaps you could enlighten me on the reason for that ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra saw the chink in his armor ."
"it was small , but she could see that he was furious at her deception ."
"she didn '' t care ."
"`` you made my life miserable you jerk ! ''"
"one eyebrow lifted at that accusation ."
"`` and how , exactly , did i do that ? ''"
"her arms dropped and she walked forward , one hand poking him in the chest to punctuate her anger ."
"`` those guards you sicced on me when i turned twelve ."
"they were there , all through my teen years , never leaving me alone ."
"i had a warped childhood and adolescence because they were always there , intimidating my friends , terrifying any man who worked up the courage to ask me out on a date ."
"i had never even kissed a man until you came around !"
"isn '' t that pathetic ? ''"
"dharr watched the elegant beauty as she lashed out at him ."
"when he '' d first seen the article that told him his mystery woman was actually his ward , the woman he '' d been duty bound to protect , he '' d been livid ."
"then the realization that he '' d slept with the woman he was supposed to be protecting hit him like a razor , shredding his pride and his sense of honor ."
"the more he thought about it , the angrier he became ."
"this tiny woman with soft , green eyes and a body any man would kill for had somehow broken through his legendary control and he was angrier than he '' d ever been in his life ."
"when he '' d read the words that condemned him and irrevocably changed his future , he '' d wanted to throttle her for what she '' d done and her lies ."
"his conscience had beaten him up several times over throughout the flight to london ."
"for the past several months , she '' d continuously disobeyed him , flaunted his rules , ignored him , berated him , tempted him beyond any other woman '' s ability to lure himand then he '' d discovered that she '' d lied to him ."
"that she was not who she '' d portrayed herself to be was the ultimate insult ."
"now , hearing her explanation and realizing what impact the guards had had on her life before he '' d met her , his conscience was slightly appeased ."
"it also helpedwhen she '' d told him that no other man had ever kissed her ."
"he was undeniably a sexist that liked ... no was proud ... of the fact that no other man had even touched her before him ."
"this beauty was completely his in every sense of the word ."
"he had no regrets for her upbringing for he realized at that moment , that the guards she '' d stated had made her life so miserable , had only protected her for him all these years ."
"knowing that , he knew exactly what he wanted ."
"and she '' d just inadvertently handed him the wayon a silver platter although she didn '' t know it ."
"`` so you didn '' t lie to me deliberately ? ''"
"he asked ."
"electra stormed over to him and punched him in the chest ."
"unfortunately , he had so much muscle , it hurt her and barely even registered on his arrogantface ."
"`` you jerk !"
"didn '' t you listen to anything i said ?"
"all i wanted was a normal life !"
"i wanted what my friends had . ''"
"`` and what was that ? ''"
"he asked , reaching down to take her hand and massage the fist he could tell was aching from her angry outburst ."
"she tried to pull her hand from his grasp but he held her firmly , kneading the flesh gently to ease the pain ."
"`` i wanted a boyfriend , freedom to get into trouble and figure out life for myself ."
"i wanted to date and be excited about my first kiss and my first lover ."
"i wanted to get a job and have all the struggles and victories other people have . ''"
"`` ah , but you aren '' t normal , electra , '' he said ."
"`` by the way , i like that name much better than ellie ."
"what made you come up with such a commonplace , calm name like ellie anyway ?"
"it never suited you . ''"
"she pulled her hand away and stepped back but she was only mildly irritated that he didn '' t like her assumed name ."
"`` i like that name ."
"it made me feel normal . ''"
"he sighed heavily and turned to face her , leaning back against the sofa and sliding his hands into his pockets as he surveyed her with new eyes ."
"eyes that saw more than she wanted him to see ."
"`` therein lies the problem ."
"you are not normal ."
"you are special . ''"
"she rolled her eyes at his comments , immediately dismissing it as just tripe he was trying to dish out to her to appease her anger ."
"`` oh , pish . ''"
"she paced back and forth in front of the sofa , her agitation making her movements jerky ."
"`` flattery will get you no where with me ."
"i have all the normal feelings of any other female ."
"probably a lot more insecurities though since i never was able to chase boys or see if they really liked me . ''"
"`` and that '' s all my fault ? ''"
"he asked , hiding his amusement on his face but she could see it in his eyes ."
"her han ds balled into fists by her side but she didn '' t take another swing at him , knowing it would hurt her more than him ."
"`` yes , you arrogant jerk !"
"and don '' t you dare laugh at me ."
"you don '' t know what it '' s like to be guarded all the time ... '' she started to say but then stopped and caught herself ."
"`` well , okay , perhaps you do know what it '' s like ."
"but you always had women around you ."
"you never knew what it was like to be the only female in the school where the boys were afraid to approach ."
"i didn '' t go to my prom or any of the school dances ."
"i never went to the movies and had sweaty palms , in anticipation of that first kiss with your new boyfriend ."
"i wanted it so desperately but each time i tried to contact you , to beg you to pull back the body guards who were destroying my life , you ignored me . ''"
"`` i was willing to meet you several weeks ago ."
"in fact , i made time in my schedule just to speak with you . ''"
"electra blushed at the memory of their first meeting ."
"`` i hate you for bringing that up , '' she countered , not sure what argument she could have for missing her meeting with him , since she was actually meeting with him ."
"it was too convoluted to figure out ."
"dharr laughed again ."
"`` you '' re not going to make me feel guilty for protecting you all your life ."
"the only thing i am feeling guilty about is taking advantage of you ."
"but that can be quickly resolved , '' he said calmly ."
"`` jamil , '' he called out and immediately , his aide appeared at the door to the living room ."
"`` is the plane ready to take off ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` it is , your highness , '' he replied , bowing slightly , his ever present notebook tucked under his arm ."
"`` good ."
"we '' ll leave immediately , '' dharr said and took electra '' s hand in his own , guiding her out of the room ."
"`` your grandmother will accompany us ."
"everything has already been announced , '' he said ."
"electra tried to pull her hand out of his but , just as before , he held it firmly ."
"it was as if he had anticipated what she would do and she didn '' t like that one bit ."
"it indicated he understood her and she wanted to hate him ."
"understanding implied something she wasn '' t willing to accept ."
"`` where are we going ? ''"
"she asked but wasn '' t too worried since her grandmother would be there with her ."
"`` you '' ll see , '' he said and pressed the code to make the elevator move ."
"`` and there '' s nothing i can do to make you tell me , is there ? ''"
"she asked , her anger ramping up a notch at his high handedness ."
"were there no end to the sins this man could impose on her ?"
"`` not really , '' he said absently as his phone rang ."
"he lifted it out of his pocket and answered it , speaking a different language she couldn '' t identify ."
"they slipped into the limousine with her grandmother calmly sitting next to her and they drove to the airport ."
"electra was only mildly concerned when the police escorted their entourage through the streets and directly onto the tarmac of the airport ."
"they boarded the plane under heavy security and as soon as they were seated , the plane taxied down the runway ."
"electra sat in her seat next to her grandmother , discussing the latest village gossip but not really paying attention to anything she said ."
"she knew some of her answers seemed a little ridiculous when she caught a few curious glances from the elderly lady ."
"electra sighed and leaned her head back against the back of the chair , closing her eyes in frustration and exhaustion ."
"`` i '' m sorry , gram ."
"i know i '' m not making any sense , am i ? ''"
"her grandmother laughed softly and patted her granddaughter '' s hand gently ."
"`` no ."
"but i can understand why you don '' t really care about betty '' s pregnancy or jennifer '' s blueberry pie when you have a few other things on your mind ."
"this is all very new and exciting for you and i can understand why you '' re a little overwhelmed by all the fuss . ''"
"electra bit her lower lip slightly and looke d down at her hands ."
"`` i don '' t understand , gram ."
"and i don '' t want to be here ."
"this isn '' t just new , it '' s different and i just want to be normal ."
"why can '' t i ever have that ? ''"
"she asked ."
"edna chuckled softly and shook her head ."
"`` electra , dear , you '' ve never been normal ."
"and i hate to break it to you but you probably never will be ."
"i know it is one of your fondest hopes , but it just isn '' t in you to be part of the crowd . ''"
"`` that '' s not true , gram ."
"i am normal ."
"i just need everyone to back away and leave me alone ."
"then i can blend in . ''"
"electra fought the tears once again , hating the small sign of weakness ."
"edna shook her head in denial ."
"`` no , my dear ."
"i hate to be the one to break this to you but you '' re special ."
"and the reason you '' ll never blend in is because people perceive that special quality within you ."
"when you were in kindergarten , you used to pack the toy trucks with sticks and mud then made little log cabins . ''"
"electra pulled back slightly , confused ."
"`` what '' s wrong with log cabins ?"
"i liked building those . ''"
"edna smiled fondly ."
"`` nothing was wrong with them ."
"in fact , they were very creative ."
"i was impressed that you were building a little village , even naming it and making a wall around to protect the villagers ."
"you were very careful to make sure they had everything they needed ."
"but the other kids would put sand in the trucks and move the sand from one spot to another . ''"
"electra let out an indignant snort , remembering the boys and how silly they were ."
"`` that was pointless , '' she replied with a disgusted grimace ."
"even now , the memory of how her friends had played such meaningless activities amazed her ."
"edna took her granddaughter '' s hand and forced electra to look into her eyes ."
"`` dear , you '' ve just proven my point ."
"you thought it was pointless and went your own way ."
"all your friends were running trying to catch up with you ."
"you were never mean to them , and loved having them around ."
"but face it , honey ."
"you '' re friends didn '' t really understand you ."
"you had ideas they just couldn '' t grasp ."
"not one of your class mates could have thought of building a village with sticks and stones ."
"now you have a man who is dynamic and charming and excites you as no other man has ever done ."
"and i think he genuinely understands the real you . ''"
"she huffed and crossed her arms over her stomach ."
"`` i wouldn '' t know about that , '' she sighed ."
"`` i wasn '' t ever able to experience other men ."
"how would i know that no other man could excite me ? ''"
"edna had to laugh at her granddaughter '' s disgruntlement ."
"`` oh , i know you occasionally tried to sneak out and experience a little of their romance ."
"but you never did it , did you ? ''"
"`` that '' s because of those silly body guards , always shadowing me ."
"good grief , gran !"
"did you know they used to hang out underneath that tree by my window trying to catch me sneaking out ? ''"
"her grandmother nodded , a twinkle in her eye ."
"`` who do you think warned them you would do that ? ''"
"electra '' s mouth dropped open in horror ."
"`` you gran ?"
"you betrayed me ? ''"
"she shut her mouth and looked at the cabin of the plane to see if anyone was close enough to hear their conversation , then quickly back to her grandmother ."
"`` how did you know what i was doing ? ''"
"edna patted her granddaughter '' s hand gently ."
"`` guess who used to have that room before you ? ''"
"electra '' s eyes widened ."
"`` you ? ''"
"grandmother , did you sneak out at night to meet with boys ? ''"
"she asked , knowing that the tree outside her window was at least a hundred years old with large , sturdy limbs that could easily hold a body ."
"`` why you little rebel , '' she laughed , the first laugh she '' d had for several hours ."
"edna smiled , obviously proud that she wasn '' t just an old fuddy duddy in her granddaughter '' s eyes any more ."
"`` of course i slipped out ."
"why do you think your grandfather and i married so young ? ''"
"she asked , primly straightening her cardigan more securely over her shoulders ."
"`` if you '' d done it all those years ago , then why did you warn the guards about me ?"
"why couldn '' t i have had those experiences as well ? ''"
"edna sighed heavily ."
"`` because you were too strong and too wild , my dear ."
"i loved you so much but after your father died , you were in so much pain and were lashing out at anyone and everyone , including yourself ."
"i was terrified of what you might do . ''"
"she looked down at her weathered hands ."
"`` and i couldn '' t face the idea of losing you as well . ''"
"a lump formed in electra '' s throat , making swallowing difficult ."
"she put an arm around her grandmother '' s shoulders and hugged her frail body gently ."
"`` oh , gran ."
"what a pair we are , '' she sniffed ."
"ednareached up and embraced electra as well ."
"`` yes , well , that brings us back full circle ."
"your current predicament . ''"
"electra sighed and pulled away ."
"`` yes ."
"so how do i get out of this tangle ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` and why i should even be in a tangle is beyond me . ''"
"`` perhaps it '' s because you dive into things with all your heart and mind , embracing life first with curiosity and enthusiasm ."
"the questions generally come a little later . ''"
"electra could see the worry and concern underlying her grandmother '' s gentle remonstration ."
"`` but you always land on your feet and that '' s what has happened now . ''"
"`` i don '' t think this constitutes landing on my feet ."
"i '' m in a plane going who knows where with a man i thought i ... '' she was about to say love but stopped herself in time , `` admired and respected but now i find out he '' s a stranger ."
"and he resents me because i '' m not who i presented to him either and have made him a laughing stock with the press . ''"
"putting her head in her hands she shivered ."
"`` how can one life get so tangled and messed up ? ''"
"edna laughed and squeezed electra '' s shoulder ."
"`` i don '' t think things are as messed up as you believe , dear ."
"i think you '' re just following the plan god has made for you ."
"after all , how can you veer from the path ?"
"it '' s inevitable . ''"
"electrashook her head ."
"`` i don '' t believe in letting fate decree my future ."
"i prefer to establish what is ahead of me myself . ''"
"her grandmother smiled ."
"`` do as you wish , dear ."
"you can '' t fight it , so you might want to just relax and enjoy the ride of your life . ''"
"with that , her grandmother picked up her mystery book and proceeded to read , leaving electra to her troubled thoughts ."
"eventually , she fell asleep and woke up several hours later with her feet propped up , the seat completely reclined and a soft blanket covering her ."
"the chair had turned into a bed that was almost more comfortable than the one she had at home ."
"trust dharr to have all the little luxuries , she thought angrily and tossed off the blanket ."
"the plane had stopped , she realized and looked around warily ."
"the other occupants of the plane were packing up their briefcases efficiently , all nodding politely to dharr as he walked forward ."
"`` are you ready ? ''"
"he asked , bending down to help her out of the chair ."
"`` where are we ? ''"
"she asked , looking out the window but all she saw was darkness and the normal airport runway lights which meant they could be anywhere in the world ."
"`` we '' re home , '' he said uninformatively ."
"electra shook her head and smiled sarcastically ."
"`` dharr , i can guarantee that we '' re not at my home because mine doesn '' t have a runway down the center of it ."
"so that must mean we '' re at your home , '' she replied , tapping her foot impatiently as she waited for him to answer her original question ."
"in response , he took her hand and led her out of the plane down in to a waiting limousine ."
"the night air didn '' t tell her anything either but she inhaled sharply fifteen minutes later when she saw the city lights outside the limousine window ."
"there were lights everywhere and she could tell that the streets were laid out in neat rows ."
"the shops were all closed at this time of the night but there was obviously a thriving cottage industry as well as many skyscrapers in the distance ."
"but what caught her attention the most were the lights in the distance that seemed to be lighting a building more magnificent than the taj mahal ."
"the place was enormous and seemed to be made almost completely of gold but she knew that wasn '' t possible ."
"it glittered in the night sky , the windows twinkling and the colors shining as if covered with jewels ."
"`` oh , dharr , your home is magnificent , '' she breathed ."
"`` thank you , '' he responded ."
"`` it is now your home as well ."
"the announcement of our engagement has already been released and the festivities planned for the next ten days . ''"
"she had a hard time pulling her eyes away from the mind boggling building but his words did the trick ."
"`` engagement ? ''"
"she asked , focusing on the one word that seemed to feel like a punch in the stomach ."
"`` what engagement ? ''"
"`` ours ."
"the announcement of our imminent wedding ."
"we '' ll be married in ten days time . ''"
"she blinked , hoping that he would smile as if he were teasing ."
"`` are you kidding ? ''"
"she asked , when he only looked back at her seriously ."
"`` i '' m afraid not , my dear . ''"
"`` we '' re getting married ? ''"
"she asked slowly , the concept not really coming through to her fatigued mind ."
"`` of course , '' he said ."
"she latched onto the only question that might make sense to her ."
"`` why of course ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` because of our relationship over the past couple of months ."
"you were my ward and it is now common knowledge that we were lovers ."
"being responsible for you has made it imperative that we marry as quickly as possible ."
"it is the only right thing to do . ''"
"electra felt deflated ."
"of all the romantic marriage proposals , that had to rank as the lowest of them all ."
"`` well , do i have anything to say about this ?"
"i mean , what if i don '' t want you to make the ultimate sacrifice and marry me to save my ruination ? ''"
"she asked , the sarcasm coming through loud and clear ."
"dharr raised one eyebrow but the astonishment was written on all his other features ."
"`` you would deny me ? ''"
"he asked , incredulous ."
"electra raised one shouldercasually ."
"`` i don '' t know ."
"since no question has been asked of me , its irrelevant , isn '' t it ? ''"
"`` you want me to ask you for your hand in marriage ? ''"
"he asked but it was more of a statement than a question and she could tell he was laughing at her again ."
"turning away from him , she crossed her arms over her stomach and stared out the window ."
"`` don '' t bother ."
"i can pretty much tell you what my answer will be , '' she said and blinked back the tears that started to form in her eyes ."
"his black eyes immediately hardened with her comment ."
"`` good to know , '' he said sharply ."
"`` i wouldn '' t want to waste my time on silly questions we both know the answer to , '' he snapped back ."
"the car pulled to a stop outside the immense front gates and dharr exited first , then turned to help her out of the car ."
"for appearances sake , she allowed him to help her out , but as soon as she was on the sidewalk , she dropped his hand as if it were a bomb ."
"she walked forward as if she were already queen , completely ignoring the man behind her but she smiled brightly to her grandmother who walked from the limousine that had been traveling behind them ."
"arm in arm , she walked into the palace with her grandmother , pretending the man who had just shattered her dreams was not two paces behind her ."
"she could feel his angry gaze boring into her back but didn '' t care ."
"she hoped she '' d hurt his feelings because she was about to shrivel up and die of shame and disappointment herself ."
"all those feelings she '' d been harboring for the man had been pointless ."
"all the dreams she '' d built up during the nights she couldn '' t sleep because she '' d been thinking of him , weaving fantasies about what a wonderful life they could have together and how much she loved him , were all shattered now ."
"he only wanted her because of duty !"
"because of obligation !"
"`` good evening , your highness , '' a man in a long white robe said , stepping around electra and her grandmother ."
"`` i trust your flight was comfortable ? ''"
"`` very ."
"please see that ms. knight and her grandmother are comfortable in their suites ."
"and send jamil to my office as soon as he arrives . ''"
"turning to electra he said , `` this is my chief of staff ."
"he '' ll make sure your rooms are to your liking ."
"please excuse me , '' he said , bowing slightly ."
"`` i have some work i need to attend to . ''"
"without another word , he walked stiffly away ."
"electra watched him walk away and , if she didn '' t know better , she '' d think he was hurt ."
"but that was impossible ."
"being hurt would mean that the man had feelings but everyone knew monsters and robots didn '' t have feelings , she told herself ."
"she followed the other man down several long hallways ."
"when he stood in front of one door , he allowed both of them to enter ."
"`` mrs. knight , this suite has been assigned for your pleasure ."
"ms. knight , if you '' ll follow me , i believe the suite next door is for you . ''"
"electra walked into a beautiful room done in soft whites and azure blues and yellows ."
"the windows were covered in long drapes but she pulled them back , gasping in pleasure at the twinkling night lights in the distance ."
"`` you just need to lift the receiver on the phone if you wish anything ."
"your luggage has already been delivered and hung up , '' he explained before bowing out of the suite ."
"electra watched him go with stunned silence before looking around ."
"there was every conceivable luxury in the room , including a huge television screen that dropped from the ceiling , an expensive stereo system , dimming lights and a bathroom with a pink , marble sunken bathtub ."
"unfortunately , she was so tired , she could barely keep her eyes open in order to investigate the rest of the room ."
"strolling to the closet , she opened the door , wanting to pull on one of her tee-shirts and dive into the comfortable looking bed ."
"but all she found were silk negligees and lace teddies ."
"no comfortable pajamas or large sleep shirts around ."
"angry at the man '' s presumpt ion , she stomped over to the phone and lifted the receiver ."
"all her fatigue was instantly gone , replaced by more fury ."
"when the line was immediately answered , she said , `` i need to see dharr immediately . ''"
"seconds later , a knock sounded on the door ."
"electra looked at the phone oddly , then shrugged and slammed it down ."
"pulling open the door to her suite , she stared at the man lounging against the door frame ."
"`` you ! ''"
"she snapped ."
"she could see the fatigue on his face and almost relented , but the tiredness quickly disappeared , to be replaced by his normal arrogance ."
"`` yes ."
"me ."
"i came by to make sure you had everything you need . ''"
"without asking permission , he pushed his way into the room and looked around as if he '' d never been in the suite before ."
"`` no , as a matter of fact , i don '' t have everything i need . ''"
"his eyes turned back to her but his face was completely impassive ."
"`` i '' m sure the staff will be able to fulfill any of your needs . ''"
"`` i need something better and more comfortable to sleep in that these , '' she stated firmly , her hand gripping the lace and silk pieces disdainfully ."
"dharr '' s eyes traveled from the silk crumpled in her hands to her face , a smile forming as he said , `` i can suggest many ways to be comfortable in bed ."
"would you follow my advice ? ''"
"electra shivered as her body remembered how easily he could make her decidedly uncomfortable ."
"`` no ."
"i wouldn '' t , '' she said firmly ."
"he took a step forward ."
"`` would you like to wager on that ?"
"i '' m pretty sure i can make you forget wearing either ofthose . ''"
"`` no , '' she whispered and took a step back ."
"his eyes flared and he nodded slightly ."
"`` yes . ''"
"taking a deep breath , she planned her escape , knowing it would have to be quick ."
"darting to the left , she dashed out of his reach , running at full speed for the open doorway ."
"she had no idea where she would go or what she would do when she got there , she just knew that she couldn '' t let dharr reduce her to a puddle of desire , which was exactly what he intended to do ."
"she could see it in his eyes ."
"but before she '' d gotten two steps , she felt the steel-like arms wrap around her waist and her body was flung up and over his shoulder ."
"`` put me down ! ''"
"she yelled , uncaring of the open door to the suite or who heard her screams ."
"she wasn '' t going to be this man '' s play thing !"
"`` with pleasure , '' he replied and a moment later , she was unceremoniously dumped onto the bed ."
"she didn '' t have a chance to escape before his strong , hard body covered hers ."
"she shook her head back and forth , avoiding his kiss but he didn '' t care ."
"he simply used his mouth in other places ."
"when his lips captured her breast trough the thin silk of her shirt , she gasped out and tried to push his head away , but he was merciless ."
"within moments , she was no longer pushing him away but was pulling him toward her , urging him to move faster ."
"in the end , they both found satisfaction ."
"electra '' s last thought before she tumbled into oblivion was , `` this still doesn '' t mean anything , '' she mumbled ."
"electra woke the following morning to chaos ."
"her bedroom was still , ominously so when she turned her head on the soft , cotton pillow ."
"but deep inside her , she could feel impending doom ."
"a moment later , the noise outside her bedroom hit her ."
"sitting up in bed , she held the sheet to her naked chest and looked around , trying to orient herself ."
"sliding out of the bed , she quickly found a robe and pulled it on , tying the silk sash tightly at her waist before venturing out into the living room of her suite ."
"she heard the word `` wedding '' and `` reception '' all within the same breath as her name and dharr '' s. shrinking back into the bedroom , she leaned heavily against the doorway , wondering how she was going to get out of this mess ."
"each time dharr touched her , she simply melted into his arms ."
"last night was evidence enough that she couldn '' t count on her body to obey her mind '' s orders ."
"stumbling to the bathroom , she showered quickly and changed into a pretty pink dress , finding a matching pair of shoes that were both comfortable and stylish ."
"she looked pretty and feminine but inside , she was a roiling mass of nerves ."
"she had to get out of here ."
"she had to leave this mess ."
"dharr didn '' t love her , he only wanted to marry her out of obligation ."
"that was a problem she '' d have to avoid at all costs ."
"she couldn '' t marry a man who didn '' t love her ."
"especially when she lo ... ."
"her stunned eyes caught her reflection in the mirror , horror at what she '' d just realized ."
"she was in love with dharr !"
"she was in love with the man who had been making her miserable all her life ."
"well , not all her life , she corrected with complete honesty ."
"she '' d been deliriously happy for the past six weeks ."
"spending each weekend with the man had been blissful , challenging , fun , hilarious and adventurous ."
"she '' d never met a man who could make her feel so much , so intensely ."
"how could she not have fallen in love with him , she asked herself when she thought about all they '' d done together ."
"no man had ever touched her before dharr but if she thought about it , she '' d never really met a man who she '' d thought was worth the effort to fool her guards ."
"on that point , her grandmother was correct ."
"if push had come to shove , she would have had her way and gone out on a date with any guy that had piqued her interest ."
"sitting on the edge of her bed , she let her head fall into her hands ."
"she would not marry a man who didn '' t love her ."
"of that , she was sure of ."
"yes , he might like her body and they were sexually compatible ."
"last night had proven that beyond a doubt ."
"even when she was angry with him , he could still reduce her to a quivering mass of need ."
"but she wanted more from life ."
"she wanted to be happy and know , deep down inside her that the man she was married to worshiped her for who she was inside ."
"not just for the body everyone else saw ."
"was that too much to ask for ?"
"no , she thought to herself ."
"it all came down to the fact that she wanted what everyone else in the world had ."
"she wanted a normal marriage ."
"and that couldn '' t happen if she was married to dharr ."
"love was the basis for a long lasting , satisfying and fulfilling marriage ."
"not obligation ."
"with grim determination she stood up and walked out of her bedroom to confront the bevy of women in the next room who were planning her wedding without consulting her in any way ."
"it was as if she were superfluous to the entire process ."
"hiding her shaking hands behind her back , she looked across at the ladies who were diligently discussing the wedding plans ."
"`` excuse me , '' she said and waited until all eyes were upon her ."
"`` i was wondering if it would be too much trouble for me to escape for a little while and walk through the markets ."
"i '' ve never been to this beautiful country and , it doesn '' t appear that i '' m needed here . ''"
"she hoped none of the ladies with kind eyes noticed the slight edge of sarcasm behind her words ."
"the group of ten women simply stared back , astonished that electra would make such a request ."
"finally , the woman in the back of the room holding a sketchpad cleared her throat and stood up ."
"`` if you desire something , you have only to ask and it will be delivered to you ."
"there is no need to go shopping on your own . ''"
"the woman had a superior air to her that just grated on electra '' s nerves ."
"it didn '' t help when the rest of the group nodded their heads in agreement ."
"obviously , a future queen going out into the marketplace like a commoner was simply not done ."
"gritting her teeth in frustration she said , `` that '' s very nice of everyone but i don '' t have anything in particular that i '' d like to purchase ."
"i simply want to look around , discover what '' s being sold and experience a little of the culture ."
"as the future queen , i '' d like to see what the country is like . ''"
"she paused for a long moment , praying the title and her use of it wouldn '' t damn her in hell ."
"it smacked of hypocrisy ."
"`` is that too much to ask ? ''"
"she questioned , making the request more of a challenge ."
"the woman who appeared to be a dressmaker shrank back down into her chair and the rest of the women looked around at each other ."
"electra decided that a mor e direct approach was needed in this situation ."
"`` perhaps i should rephrase my comment , '' she said and straightened her shoulders ."
"`` i '' m going to explore the marketplace ."
"if any of you would like to join me , i would be delighted but i understand that each of you is diligently working on the king '' s orders ."
"since i '' ve been taken out of the wedding equation , i find myself redundant to the activities and will therefore occupy myself in some other way . ''"
"with that , she turned on her heel and walked out of the suite of rooms , leaving ten stunned faces behind ."
"she would have laughed if she weren '' t so terrified ."
"she had to continue with this brave facade , otherwise everything would be ruined ."
"feigning a confidence she didn '' t feel , she walked up to gerrard who was still assigned to be her guard ."
"`` i '' m going to visit the marketplace , '' she said and turned toward what she hoped was the exit to the palace ."
"she felt more than heard gerrard walking behind her and as she approached one hallway , she heard him sayingsomething into a hidden speaker ."
"she '' d seen things like that on television in the movies , especially in the american movies where the secret service guards would communicate about the american president through hidden microphones , but she '' d never thought she would be part of that process ."
"when she reached the exit , by luck more than her sense of direction which was generally backward at best , she breathed a sigh of relief when she saw a limousine already positioned outside with an suv in front and behind it ."
"a guard was holding open the door and she smiled to the strange man as she stepped into the darkened interior ."
"she sat still as the car drove her through the streets of the city and when they stopped , she was fascinated by the market place ."
"it was like an old world bazaar ."
"there were tents with brightly colored fabrics protecting each vendor '' s face from the harsh sun ."
"about half of the women were wearing the burka while the other half were dressed in western clothing , the teenagers even exposing navels and wearing earrings while the spoke on cell phones or listened to music through headphones ."
"good , she thought to herself as she smiled to each of the vendors , pretending to ignore the guards that were surrounding her ."
"this was exactly the type of environment she was hoping for ."
"it suited her purposes perfectly ."
"`` that looks lovely , '' she said to one vendor who was displaying several long , colorful robes ."
"`` how much ? ''"
"she asked and instantly the vendor smiled , bowing slightly as he gave her a price ."
"electra smiled tentatively and looked at micha who was standing behind her ."
"`` is that a good price ? ''"
"she asked ."
"the angry expression on micha '' s face told her the answer before he spoke , furiously waving his hands and gesturing toward other stalls lined up down the main aisle of the marketplace ."
"after several comments , the vendor blushed , bowed deeply and nodded his head ."
"`` what did you say to him ? ''"
"electra asked as she watched the vendor hand the neatly wrapped robe to micha ."
"`` he quoted a price three times the usual for you . ''"
"electra was horrified ."
"`` really ? ''"
"she asked , looking back at the man ."
"`` why ? ''"
"`` because he knows you are the bride and therefore , wealthy ."
"he was ripping you off . ''"
"micha tried to take the bag but electra maintained it in her own hands ."
"`` that '' s okay ."
"if i can '' t carry something , i shouldn '' t buy it , right ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` we '' re here to serve you , '' he said , bowing slightly and reaching for the package ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she snapped a little too loudly ."
"noticing the stunned look o n his face , she smiled quickly to appease him ."
"`` i '' m sorry , micha ."
"i know you '' re just trying to do your duty but its been only one dayand i '' ve been waited on , pampered and basically coddled so much , i '' d just like to do something for myself for once ."
"youknow how independent i '' ve been in the past ."
"soon , all of this will be taken away from me and i '' ll be hidden in the palace with nothing better to do but figure out which outfit i '' ll wear to dinner that night ."
"i need something that tells me i '' m not going to perish ."
"if that something is simply carrying my own bag , what '' s the harm ? ''"
"her explanation seemed to sooth his concern and he bowed again but stepped back , signaling that he would allow her to carry her own purchases ."
"breathing a sigh of relief th at her plan wouldn '' t be spoiled by overly attentive servants , she turned and looked down the rest of the aisle ."
"there were so many vendors and obviously word of who she was had spread ."
"many people were looking in her direction , smiling brightly and some even bowing ."
"electra '' s heart sank ."
"if she was known to everyone , how was she going to slip away unnoticed ?"
"this might be harder than she '' d thought ."
"taking a deep breath , she squared her shoulders and pasted a bright smile on her face , then continued down the aisle toward the next stall ."
"she bought one item from each vendor , including a large bag that would hold all her purchases ."
"acting as if she didn '' t want to leave any vendor out , she continued to purchase at least one thing from all of them , delighting the vendors and the populace alike ."
"slipping behind one of the brightly colored fabrics at one stall , she stayed hidden long enough to determine how many seconds it took for her guards to become concerned ."
"they were perfectly vigilant so she calculated she had only a few seconds ."
"one or several of them had an eye on her at all times ."
"this wasn '' t good , she thought ."
"she needed more time , at least a minute in order to disappear into the crowd ."
"then an idea struck her ."
"she '' d never be able to melt into the crowd in her own garb ."
"her appearance was known all over the country now and she '' d easily be recognized ."
"besides , each person in the marketplace was watching her , eagerly anticipating making a sale of their own so they could brag about how each had sold a coveted trinket to the future queen ."
"it took several more stalls before she found what she was looking for ."
"the long , black material looked hot and uncomfortable and the veil was thick , made to cover all of her hair and some of her face.she '' d have to wipe off her makeup , she thought , biting her lower lip as she figured out her new strategy ."
"but glancing back at gerrard and micha as well as the other guards who were surrounding her , she figured she could duck behind something , throw on the burka and basically vanish from everyone while being in plain sight ."
"it would work , she told herself ."
"it had to ."
"she hadn '' t been able to come up with another idea ."
"glancing backwards , she noticed that several of the guards were now being used for crowd control ."
"one of them was talking into his microphone , possibly calling for backup as the crowds started to increase now that word of her presence and patronage spread ."
"it was now or never , she thought ."
"if extra guards arrived , she '' d be doomed and would arrive back in the palace with efficiency and the nauseating decorum she '' d been dealing with for the past several days ."
"looking back one more time , she caught micha '' s eyes ."
"the look lasted longer than normal and she sent the silent message of apology ."
"she noticed the guard '' s expression change so she shook her head , telling him that everything was okay ."
"he turned away , watching the crowds but she knew that there was added tension in his shoulders ."
"she '' d have to work fast and she slipped behind one of the sheets , her voice exclaiming with feigned delight ."
"a moment later , she ducked down behind a pile of fabric and threw the black material over her head ."
"she could feel her heart beat increase and the sweat on her back start to drip ."
"the tension would make her fail if she wasn '' t careful ."
"hearing the murmurs of the crowd , she tied the veil as efficiently as she could ."
"then on her knees , she crawled to the opposite end of the stall ."
"peeking over the top of the table piled with fabrics , she noticed with relief that most of the people were still watching the area in which she '' d disappeared ."
"with a sigh of relief , she stepped up and walked down the aisle , back toward the cars ."
"she kept her head down and pulled the veil as low over her forehead as possible , hoping no one would notice her ."
"there were a couple of men who watched her , one even pointed in her direction and her heart almost stopped in fear that they might call out and alert her guards ."
"by the time she was back at the cars , she bit her lower lip in indecision ."
"there was obviously an alert raised as one of her guards ran by her , stepping into the suv and speaking rapidly on a radio ."
"but moments later , he gave her the ideal exit strategy ."
"he raced back to the crowd , his eyes swerving from side to side , obviously looking for her ."
"with a stealth she hadn '' t felt since she was twelve years old , she walked casually over to the open suv and stepped inside ."
"the keys were gone , but old memories about hotwiring quickly came back to her ."
"pulling the wires out from underneath the dashboard , she quickly determined which wires would work ."
"her fingers were shaking violently and she was breathing so rapidly , she wasn '' t sure if she '' d be able to ever catch her breath again ."
"but surprisingly , within moments , she was able to tap the correct wires together , sparking the ignition into start ."
"slamming the door shut behind her , she glanced back ."
"amazingly , all was still clear , the guards were milling about quickly while the crowd watched in confusion ."
"shifting the truck into gear , she pulled away from the curb with as little panic as possible ."
"electra was still watching in her rear view mirror a half hour later , wondering how she '' d been so successful this time when she '' d failed miserably all her teen years ."
"she continued to drive , relieved that the tank was full of gas ."
"that meant she '' d be able to drive without having to stop and figure out how to purchase gas ."
"since she had little money , she wasn '' t sure how that would be accomplished ."
"by the time night fell , she was hungry , but still too terrified of being caught to stop and purchase food at some of the smaller villages ."
"she kept driving , not even becoming sleepy since the adrenaline was still pumping through her body ."
"by midnight , after twelve hours of driving , she made it to the border ."
"she saw the signs but no guards ."
"pulling over to the side of the road , she paused ."
"in great britain , the borders were all water but she '' d heard of how protective other countries were of their borders ."
"if she drove over that line , would guards come racing up to arrest her ?"
"would she be instantly identified ?"
"electra remembered reading about the american and canadian borders ."
"there were electronic devices that alerted the border guards that someone was crossing ."
"if the car didn '' t arrive at the guard station , they would come out and find the culprit ."
"looking around her , she didn '' t see any potential devices , nor were there any signs directing her to check in with a border guard ."
"taking a deep breath , she pressed the accelerator and moved forward ."
"as her tires crossed over the border , her body tensed , her ears came alert , trying to sense the slightest movement which would alert her to border guards coming down on her ."
"as her back tires crossed the border , she waited , actually breaking , prepared at any moment for someone to stop , for machine guns to be pointed in her direction and swarms of sirens to go off ."
"still nothing ."
"it was odd , she thought ."
"where was everyone ?"
"she pressed the accelerator again and drove toward an unknown destination ."
"she had only a little cash left after filling the tank up about four hours ago ."
"so she kept driving , worried that she '' d be stopped at any point ."
"still , nothing happened ."
"she was fifty miles passed the border when she finally allowed herself to think she '' d gotten away with her escape ."
"well , not completely , she told herself ."
"she was still in a foreign country where she didn '' t speak the language , she had very little cash , but thankfully still had her passport with her ."
"that was one obstacle she didn '' t have to overcome she thought gratefully ."
"food was her next crisis ."
"once she had something to eat , she '' d be able to think through the next step ."
"airport , security , finding a place to hide while she figured out what she was going to do with her life ."
"electra shut off her mind ."
"it was too much and she needed to think only of the next step ."
"everything else would fall into place once she had some sleep and found some food ."
"chapter 10 three days later , electra put the truck into park , she simply laid her head down on the steering wheel , unable to move for several long minutes ."
"the only reason she was able to move her sleep deprived body was the knowledge that a comfortable bed with warm blankets waiting for her less than ten yards away ."
"since she had no luggage , she shut off the motor and walked up the pathway to the beach house ."
"her mind absently noted the sea scented air but her limbs could barely carry her up the wooden stairs to the front door ."
"since it was early fall , the area was basically deserted except for the birds flying overhead on the lookout for late season clams and fish ."
"thankfully , the key was under the mat where her friend had told her it would be and she unlocked the door ."
"electra wanted to cry and bang her fists against the injustice of the whole situation , but she was just too tired to do anything other than find the bedroom and curl up ."
"she didn '' t even have the strength to make the bed ."
"instead , she kicked off the dime storeshoes she '' d been wearing for the past two days , then just curled up , wrapping the blanket around her ."
"her last thought before closing her eyes was how much she missed dharr and wanted his arms around her as she slept ."
"electra slept for over twenty-four hours ."
"that was partly due to the lack of familiar sounds that would alert her that a new day was starting , but it was mostly due to her lack of sleep for so many days ."
"when she finally did wake up , she looked around and sighed with relief ."
"she was still alone , still in the beach house and still unmarried ."
"that was the most important part , she reminded herself ."
"she had to avoid marriage to dharr ."
"that would be the ultimate defeat of who she was ."
"she '' d already lived under his author ity all her life ."
"the body guards and lack of normalcy had been completely unfair and he '' d never accept that she had been perfectly safe without the guards ."
"oh , electra knew she might have done some stupid things , but that was part of growing up ."
"one had to learn to walk and run , take a few scrapes in the knees , possibly a few broken bones , to know how to live and become an adult ."
"and now he wanted her to bind her life to him , be simply a part of his palace accessories ."
"she '' d be taken out when the need was appropriate and bear his children but that would be her role for the rest of her life ."
"she wanted more than that ."
"she deserved more ."
"she '' d been denied so much all her life ; first her mother , then her father , then her freedom , then a job where she could find self worth , identity and accomplishment ."
"but she wouldn '' t fall into a marriage with a man who didn '' t love her ."
"no matter how much she loved him , she thought sadly ."
"pushing the blankets away , she walked stiffly to the bathroom ."
"when she saw her reflection in the mirror , she gasped in horror ."
"the dark circles under her eyes were just the beginning ."
"her skin was pale , her eyes were swollen and her lips were almost white with the stress of the past week ."
"turning away from her image with a grimace , she turned on the hot shower , determined to start to turn her life around and decide what she was going to do ."
"but instead of making decisions , she simply stood under the warm water and cried , terrified of never seeing dharr again , terrified of him finding her and every scenario in between ."
"but how could he find her ?"
"she '' d never spoken of her friends before and if he made the odd connection to the woman who had given her the job and the beach house , then she '' d be surprised ."
"would someone at the school talk ?"
"could someone possibly know about her friend '' s beach house ?"
"it was small and lori said she rarely rented it out because it was so isolated ."
"not many people wanted to holiday in this remote part of the beach ."
"it was too far from the restaurants and bars , dance clubs and night life ."
"she bit her lip as she made a pot of coffee , wrapped in a fluffy white robe her friend had left in a closet ."
"there were a few other clothes she '' d borrow until she could get to the store but for right now , all she wanted to do was snuggle down into the terry cloth , drink coffee and try to feel alive again ."
"the day turned into a week and she found herself falling into a rhythm during the days ."
"she '' d wake up with the birds chirping outside her window , shower and make coffee ."
"then she '' d take her coffee and a blanket out onto the wooden deck to slowly come alive ."
"she bought several books to read , but by the end of the week , she hadn '' t even read the first chapter of the first one ."
"she '' d simply stare out to sea , wondering what she was going to do with her life now ."
"by the early evening , when she realized that she '' d accomplished nothing during the day , she '' d angrily pull out the note paper from an old , worn desk and start making lists ."
"they weren '' t complicated lists , just things that occurred to her ."
"one was a list of the things she '' d like to learn , another was all the personality traits she hated in dharr ."
"they were harsh things like his arrogance , egotism , selfishness , high handed way he '' d just dumped her into the assigned suite at the palace and ignored her ."
"when that list was finished , she started another that listed all the character traits she wanted in her ideal man ."
"this one was more comprehensive and started off with the ideal that the man she married would love her completely ."
"he would also be kind , considerate , tolerant , treat her with respect and would never assume she '' d become his mistress !"
"the last one was underlined several times ."
"when the second list was finished , she realized it was just more of the first list but she stuck it up on the refrigerator anyway ."
"on the morning of the seventh day , she decided that she had to do something more than just drink coffee , then write about how angry she was with dharr ."
"perhaps it had just taken her the week to overcome the exhaustion , both physical and mental , that had overwhelmed her during her escape , but she woke that morning feeling much better ."
"and then it struck her ."
"today was her wedding day !"
"would dharr have called off the wedding ?"
"or had he simply postponed it , assuming that he would have found her by now ?"
"her fingers twitched slightly over the remote that would turn on the television , but in the end , she decided against listening to the news ."
"she didn '' t want to know ."
"that wasn '' t her life ."
"she didn '' t know what her life was anymore , but she '' d figure it out somehow ."
"chapter 11 dharr prowled the london penthouse , snapping orders at anyone who dared to come into his presence without word of electra '' s presence ."
"he was out of control of a situation for the first time in his life and he didn '' t know how to handle it ."
"usually , he would discuss the situation , form a plan and battle all the obstacles in order to achieve the desired goal ."
"but in this case , the goal was the obstacle ."
"when her guards had first reported her missing , his stomach had fallen out of his body ."
"the worry that had eaten at him during that horrible twenty-four hours had been the worst period in his life , bar none ."
"he '' d even been able to handle his father '' s death with more composure than the thought of losing electra ."
"and when the reports finally came through that she was fine but had escaped , simply driven away in one of the guard vehicles , he '' d been furious ."
"he honestly couldn '' t imagine feeling that furious before and if she '' d shown up at that moment , he would have happily rung her pretty little neck ."
"how dare she run from him ?"
"from what they have together ?"
"she loved him , dammit !"
"he knew she did ."
"so what was the problem ?"
"they were to be married ."
"today in fact !"
"of course , he '' d postponed the wedding last week when no reports of her whereabouts had surfaced after the last sighting in heathrow airport ."
"he '' d told the eager reporters and well wishers seven days ago that electra was too nervous of disappointing the people and had requested a delay so she could learn their culture more ."
"everyone had loved that excuse , loving her even more for that ."
"of course there were rumors that she '' d run away but he '' d quashed them quickly ."
"but if he didn '' t get her back soon , some people were going to start to wonder ."
"hell , he was starting to wonder ."
"`` are you okay ? ''"
"edna knight asked softly ."
"dharr '' s angry eyes looked across the room at the one woman who had been his saving grace during this whole ordeal ."
"electra '' s grandmother was sensible and realistic and he '' d gone to her several times over the past week , asking her for more information about electra , trying to gain some insight into why she '' d run away ."
"he thought he understood now , but until he found her and spoke to her , he would never be sure ."
"and not being absolutely sure of anything tore dharr up ."
"he '' d been raised to be sure , to analyze every situation and come to a realistic solution ."
"`` where is she ? ''"
"he growled , prowling around the breakf ast room as if he could tear open the walls and search for her with his bare hands ."
"edna sighed , angry herself with her granddaughter but showing that frustration and disappointment wouldn '' t help this situation ."
"`` i would guess someplace quiet so she can think . ''"
"`` yes , you '' ve said that ."
"how much time does she need to think ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"edna laughed ."
"`` it will take her a while just to see how silly she '' s being ."
"but don '' t give up . ''"
"his eyes burned into the older woman '' s and he lit upon the one thing he thought he was confident about ."
"`` you know she loves me too , don '' t you ? ''"
"edna nodded sagely ."
"`` yes ."
"and she probably knows it as well . ''"
"`` then why the hell did she run ? ''"
"he asked for the millionth time ."
"`` and how can you be sure she hasn '' t been kidnapped ? ''"
"`` two reasons ."
"the only reasons she would be kidnapped is to be ransomed for money or influence ."
"neither of those probabilities havecome to light , have they ? ''"
"she only waited a moment for the shake to confirm her point before continuing ."
"`` besides , if i know you , and i '' m starting to if just a little , then i '' d wager you '' ve already tested the kidnapping waters and no one is claiming responsibility ."
"am i correct with that assumption ? ''"
"dharr had indeed had his agents out searching for possible ransom activists but none were even aware that his fiancee had slipped away ."
"there were no worries in that front ."
"at least no political worries , he clarified ."
"`` since that '' s not the case , and you '' ve mentioned seeing electra in london , then she probablyis hidden away somewhere trying to work out of being in love with you . ''"
"`` is that a possibility ? ''"
"he demanded , walking towards her with fury in his eyes ."
"edna held up her hand gently to slow his progress ."
"`` no ."
"not with my granddaughter ."
"once she gives her heart , it is well and truly in love ."
"she has loyalty down to a science . ''"
"`` then where the hell is she ? ''"
"he asked , running his fingers through his hair ."
"he heard a discreet cough at the doorway and swung around ."
"`` what is it ? ''"
"he demanded , his black eyes boring into one of his aides ."
"`` tell me quickly and then get the hell out of here . ''"
"`` there '' s news , your highness , '' he started off warily ."
"`` tell me now ! ''"
"he growled , pulling the man into the breakfast room and reading the report quickly ."
"whenhe was finished , he shoved the papers back at the man ."
"`` get the plane fueled and ready to depart immediately . ''"
"`` already done , your highness , '' he said , bowing low ."
"`` all is ready and waiting for your arrival at the airport . ''"
"electra pulled the paper toward her once again but this time , it was simply to make out a grocery list ."
"she felt better , but she had to take things one step at a time ."
"food was one of the most basic things in life and she '' d been living off of coffee , cheese and crackers for the past two days ."
"when she finished with that trip , she would start calling people , making plans and seeing if there was a small town somewhere that needed a teacher ."
"she '' d need some place that needed help and wouldn '' t ask too many questions ."
"it would have to be small , she thought , thinking through the small villages she knew of ."
"and it would have to be far away from london ."
"grabbing the keys to the jeep off the hook , she opened the front door , only to inhale sharply when she saw the man standing on thefront stoop ."
"`` dharr ! ''"
"she gasped , backing into the room as he entered ."
"`` good morning , my dear , '' he said , walking into the small beach house , his eyes sweeping through the place quickly before coming to rest on electra ."
"`` i wish i could say otherwise , but you '' re really not looking well . ''"
"she was torn between two reactions ."
"part of her wanted to throw herself into his arms and cry out with joy , thinking for the past ten days that she '' d never see his handsome face ever again had been devastating ."
"the other part of her wanted to run and hide , terrified of what he was already making her feel ."
"her determination to fall out of love with this man was already disintegrating ."
"`` how did you find me ? ''"
"she asked , deciding to start with the most basic issue ."
"h er hands were shaking so she hid them behind her back , holding onto the kitchen chair for support ."
"`` my agents started tracking you when you crossed the border ."
"we found out you '' d come back to london seven days ago , but then you '' d dropped out of sight again . ''"
"`` and ? ''"
"she prompted ."
"`` you went grocery shopping two days later ."
"it took my agents that long to determine where you might be staying . ''"
"`` oh , '' she said , looking down at the floor ."
"she hadn '' t thought anyone had recognized her at the small store ten miles away ."
"`` well , then ."
"where does that leave us ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` where do you want it to leave us ? ''"
"he asked , walking into the small galley kitchen ."
"he was looking around , his eyes latching onto her lists that were tacked upon the refrigerator ."
"`` that '' s nothing , '' she said , quickly moving towards him in an effort to grab her lists out of his hand ."
"but he simply raised it higher , out of her reach while he read through the lists ."
"for the first time , his firm mouth eased into a slight smile ."
"he glanced down at her ."
"`` interesting list ."
"i assume these are my character traits ? ''"
"he asked , then went on to the next one ."
"he actually chuckled as he read through her list of things she wanted in a man ."
"when he was finished , he looked at her again ."
"`` liar , '' he simply said ."
"`` what do you know ? ''"
"she asked and walked away , crossing her arms over her chest in defiance ."
"he quickly read through the final list ."
"she '' d made that one yesterday and wished she '' d burned it instead of tacking it up with the others ."
"it was the one that listed all the things she liked about him ."
"all his finer qualities ."
"at the bottom of the long list , she '' d written , `` great lover '' ."
"he laughed at that one ."
"`` i '' m surprised great lover '' is at the bottom of the list ."
"i would have thought it would rank higher . ''"
"`` that just goes to show how much you know me , dharr ."
"i don '' t consider sexual compatibility one of the finer features of a man . ''"
"he put the lists down on the table and walked toward her once again ."
"`` obviously ."
"there are abouttwenty other things on the list that you love about me . ''"
"`` like , '' she clarified defiantly ."
"`` the list says love about dharr '' , '' he challenged ."
"`` it '' s a mistake , '' she countered , her chin inching up defiantly ."
"`` but we '' re not , '' he responded ."
"her eyes clouded over and she shook her head ."
"`` yes ."
"we are . ''"
"`` why do you think so ? ''"
"`` because of all the things on the first list . ''"
"`` that '' s just window dressing and you know it ."
"want to know yourfaults ? ''"
"he suggested ."
"`` you '' re too stubborn for your own good , you '' re too independent for my good and you aren '' t very honest with yourself ."
"if you were , you '' d admit that you '' re in love with me . ''"
"she turned away from him , not wanting him to see her face which would surely reveal that he was right on target ."
"`` what '' s the point ? ''"
"`` perhaps because i love you and not having you by my side or at least knowing where you are has driven me insane this past week ? ''"
"she swung around to look at his eyes and her mouth fell open with his admission ."
"it was so unlike him to admit a vulnerability ."
"`` really ? ''"
"she whispered , a small glimmer of hope sparked in her heart ."
"he nodded for emphasis , his dark eyes holding her gaze , not letting her look away from him ."
"`` really ."
"add to that the idea of you being in another man '' s arms makes me a little murderous so don '' t ever cheat on me . ''"
"`` never , '' she said and didn '' t resist when he pulled her into his arms ."
"`` and you '' re going to marry me in one week and you '' ll say you love me every day until and after that time . ''"
"`` will you also say that to me ? ''"
"she asked , hurt and pain of the previous ten days coming to the forefront ."
"`` absolutely . ''"
"he kissed her gently before saying , `` and as for number three on the don '' t like about dharr '' list , you '' ll have plenty of freedom ."
"i won '' t be taking you out like some sort of trophy wife . ''"
"he chuckled and hugged her close ."
"`` in fact , the whole world is eager to know what kinds of reforms you '' d like to start making in my country ."
"so you have a great deal of responsibility ."
"you '' ll have to make sure to save some time for me once in a while , '' he teased when she snuggled up against his massive chest ."
"`` oh , dharr ."
"do you really mean all of this ? ''"
"she asked , thinking it was all too much of a fantasy ."
"`` all of it ."
"especially the part about me loving you . ''"
"`` oh , dharr !"
"i love you too ! ''"
"`` please don '' t ever leave me , '' he whispered against her hair ."
"`` i don '' t think i can take that kind of fear again . ''"
"`` you were scared ? ''"
"she asked , pulling back slightly ."
"`` terrified ."
"i thought i '' d lost you ."
"and i was willing to tear up the world in order to find you . ''"
"he looked around the tiny beach house and smiled ."
"`` but i guess i should have considered a place like this instead of a luxurious hotel somewhere ."
"you '' ve always kept me on my toes , haven '' t you ? ''"
"electralaughed and stood up on her toes to kiss him ."
"`` no more than you do for me , '' she whispered ."
"chapter 1 dana stared at the elderly chief of staff with growing horror ."
"`` but ... .i really do n't want to be promoted , '' she said through stiff lips that could barely move from the fear caving in on her , the metallic taste of terror overwhelming the sandalwood and coffee scents that normally permeated this man 's office ."
"`` i 'm perfectly happy in my current role . ''"
"even the normal low hum off office noises faded as the blood pounded through her brain , blocking out everything but the panic ."
"this was really bad ."
"her current position as an office assistant was perfect , keeping her in the background and giving her the anonymity she craved , a state of being she had n't had in a long time and something she desperately needed ."
"forget the extra pay , dana thought anxiously ."
"she wanted to be invisible ."
"she needed to be just a face in the crowd that no one noticed , no one looked at twice ."
"her assistant 's position was challenging , interesting and , what was more important , it did n't give her any visibility ."
"being promoted to a senior assistant 's role was a much more obvious position ."
"because of the previous year , being noticed meant danger , something she 'd traveled halfway around the world to avoid ."
"she was n't going to give it up without a fight ."
"unfortunately , the chief of staff was n't a man one could argue with ."
"he laid down the rules and the rest of the staff followed ."
"that had been fine before but she had to really think hard to come up with a good reason to not accept that promotion ."
"`` i 'm really not qualified for this role , sir ."
"there are so many people more deserving of this promotion that ... '' omar suleiman , the sheik of odar 's chief of staff , interrupted her impatiently , waving his hand in front of him as if the conversation were over ."
"he 'd made his decision and he rarely allowed arguments , much less discussion from office personnel ."
"`` you 've earned it ."
"your work is excellent , you 're attention to detail has been noticed not to mention your fluency in arabic , english and french , an important asset to his highness ."
"the role comes with a significant increase in salary , of course , not to mention prestige and a great deal of travel . ''"
"her head was spinning , and not from excitement but from the overwhelming urge to run and hide ."
"`` what happened to mr. kingsley ?"
"he 's been doing this job for the past twenty years ."
"i thought he was happy in the role . ''"
"`` he has done an excellent job for the kingdom ."
"but he has requested retirement and since he is now over seventy years old , we have granted this request . ''"
"this was said as if to inform dana that she too would be expected to remain in the role until well after her expected retirement ."
"her mind swam with the various possibilities or arguments against this promotion , anything that would get her out of this role ."
"`` i really do n't think ... . ''"
"omar 's eyebrows went down in irritation at her continued resistance to his plan ."
"`` enough , '' he said emphatically ."
"`` i know this is a bit much for you , but you will take the role if his highness agrees that you fit the requirements ."
"and you will continue to do an excellent job because i believe it is in your nature to be meticulous in your responsibilities ."
"if you have any questions about anything that comes up , you may come directly to me for assistance . ''"
"he stood up from behind his desk , his long , white robes flowing behind him ."
"`` come with me , '' he ordered and walked out of the well appointed office , expecting dana to simply follow because he 'd ordered it ."
"and of course , she followed ."
"one simply did n't ignore the sheik 's chief of staff ."
"that was , until he started to lead her into the sheik 's office ."
"`` why would we be going in there ? ''"
"she asked , her voice choked and she hesitated before entering the room where decisions were made that could change the economy of massive countries ."
"she peered inside , half expecting to see ... .well , she was n't sure what she was expecting , but it certainly was n't an innocuous office setup ."
"since the office was empty except for omar , she entered and looked around , amazed at how gorgeous the office was ."
"there were tall windows that let in sunshine and bookcases along one wall that went from the floor to the ceiling with a ladder that swung along a rail so a person could select books on any shelf ."
"the furniture was dark and heavy , very masculine but it fit the man who ruled this oil rich , powerful country ."
"she 'd seen the sheik many times of course ."
"who had n't ?"
"he was one of those men that women did internet searches on just to gaze at his rugged , handsome looks ."
"she 'd never seen him close up though ."
"he was much too powerful for anyone at her level to get close to but she knew him to be tall , was rumored to be charming and he worked out regularly with his guards , although she had no idea what that meant ."
"perhaps they all just competed to see who could lift the most weights or maybe they battled each other until someone was bloody ."
"she did n't care , and did n't want to know ."
"all she wanted was her tiny office in the back hallway where she could do her work and remain safe and unnoticed ."
"`` his highness will be with you shortly , '' the chief of staff said , before walking out of the office ."
"dana stared after him for a long , terrified moment before she started pacing ."
"her mind worked frantically , trying to come up with reasons why she was n't the best candidate for the position ."
"she just could n't risk having that kind of spotlight but she also did n't want to leave her current role ."
"she loved her job , but more importantly , she loved the security of the palace ."
"no one was getting to her while she worked within the palace walls , especially not to see a lowly secretary ."
"the role of assistant to the sheik would require her to work outside the palace much more often , to be at his side during travel , official visits and various other events ."
"possibly even social events that would be publicized although maybe she could remain hidden in the shadows during those functions ."
"dana had no idea what the protocol might be and the lack of knowledge made her even more frantic ."
"no , she 'd just have to be brilliant and come up with a fabulous , valid , irrefutable reason for why she was completely inappropriate for the job ."
"she spotted a pad of paper on the corner of the desk and picked it up , selecting a pen as well ."
"she paced back and forth in the office as she thought about different reasons why she was n't right , writing them down in a list ."
"some of the ideas were ridiculous and she crossed them out , but others were very valid ."
"of course , she did n't write the main reason ."
"no , that one would have to remain a secret since it might get her fired from her current role and probably tossed out of the country ."
"sheik hassan bin faisir-al-takar watched in fascination as the lovely woman walked back and forth across his office , mumbling something under her breath before scribbling on his note pad ."
"she also had his favorite pen but since she looked so earnest in whatever she was trying to think of , he did n't want to disturb her ."
"besides , she was definitely a sight to behold ."
"she was wearing a wrap around dress that hugged her in all the right places and he enjoyed it both when she was heading towards him so he could see her lush breasts that tapered to a tiny waist , or when she was walking away from him and he was presented with her cute derriere that moved underneath the fabric with each step she took , drawing his eyes to the enticing flesh underneath ."
"he wondered how long her brown hair was since it was contained in a neat chignon at the base of her neck but her eyes were a warm , sexy brown that seemed to dance with whatever was on her mind ."
"this woman was so intent , she did n't even realize that he was there , leaning in the doorway watching her ."
"but after several moments , his curiosity got the better of him and he wanted to know what could possibly be troubling a woman as lovely as this little one ."
"he knew this was the woman he was supposed to be interviewing for the role of his executive assistant but she was completely inappropriate for the role ."
"her porcelain skin and her rosebud lips , not to mention that knockout figure , meant she would be too much of a distraction ."
"beautiful women were lovely to have around , but not during business hours ."
"the work of the kingdom had to be accomplished and with this one flitting in and out of his office and meetings , he would be hard pressed to concentrate ."
"omar must be getting old if he thought this little beauty was the perfect candidate ."
"dana turned around , trying to come up with at least three more reasons why she would n't work out when she spotted the man standing in the doorway ."
"goodness he was tall !"
"and getting taller as he came closer !"
"the top of her head barely reached his shoulder and she shrank back slightly as he approached ."
"at his dark , intent look , she cringed slightly , intimidated despite herself ."
"when he was a few feet away , she remembered palace protocol and dropped her pen and note pad while she dipped into a deep curtsy ."
"`` your highness ! ''"
"she gasped and looked down at the ground , wondering how one was supposed to gracefully curtsy and then pick up a stolen pen and pad of paper without looking like a fool ."
"probably too late for that , she thought with an inward grimace ."
"he smiled slightly at her genuflection , done with enthusiasm , but very little practice ."
"`` you 're here to interview for the role of my executive assistant ? ''"
"he stated , moving to a seating area away from his desk that contained two large , brown , leather chairs and an enormous brown , leather sofa ."
"`` please , have a seat and let 's discuss the possibilities . ''"
"dana smiled gratefully , glad that he was n't going to sit behind that massive desk and look even more daunting ."
"she thought it would be less intimidating if they were sitting away from a symbol of his absolute power in this country ."
"but as they sat down , his long , muscular legs coming much too close to her own , she realized that she 'd been wrong ."
"this man was n't intimidating because of some external symbol of power ."
"he was just terrifying as a man !"
"as his intelligent , grey eyes looked at her , she had to glance away or get lost in their sensuous depths ."
"she 'd always thought of those lines as a crock when she 'd read them in books but now she understood what it meant when a man had `` bedroom eyes '' ."
"she literally could n't focus when he looked at her like that and once again , the idea of running and hiding someplace was very tempting but for completely different reasons now ."
"first things first , she reminded herself ."
"get her old job back and then she could worry about all these silly little feelings she had for a man she 'd met thirty seconds ago ."
"`` about the job , '' she started to say , `` i think that your chief of staff might have been a bit too hasty about submitting my name for the position . ''"
"`` why do you say that ? ''"
"he asked , already confused by her approach ."
"he 'd been expecting her to immediately begin listing all of her experience and how she would be perfect for the role ."
"after which , he would have to gently tell her that she would n't work out , but that he would see what other options might suit her better within the palace ."
"the opposite approach to this interview certainly had his attention ."
"`` well , for one , i 'm definitely too young and inexperienced ."
"i certainly do n't have all the skills necessary to be your executive assistant . ''"
"he tried not to show the surprise on his face as she stated the first thing that had come to his mind ."
"but with her comment , he was somehow forced to challenge her assertion ."
"`` it 's my understanding that you 've already met all the skills requirements for this role and they 've been amply demonstrated ."
"otherwise , omar would n't have suggested you for the position . ''"
"that stumped her ."
"`` i ca n't imagine that my experience could surpass the skills of your last assistant ."
"he 'd been with you for years . ''"
"`` you 've been helping my previous assistant for the past six months , is that correct ? ''"
"`` yes , but ... '' `` so you have the requirements . ''"
"he stated that with emphasis and a slight shrug that told her he was n't going to argue her skill set any longer ."
"`` but ... . ''"
"she scrambled and looked down , focusing her mind to regroup and quickly go over the notes she 'd scribbled minutes ago ."
"`` i do n't know palace protocol well enough ."
"i could make some pretty horrible errors and offend someone ."
"even my curtsy is pretty pathetic and that 's just the beginning of my lack of knowledge . ''"
"he nodded his head , about to say something , but she stopped him again with what she considered another mark against her ."
"`` i do n't know all of the personnel who would be useful so if something needed to be done quickly , i might go to the wrong person to ask for help , thereby slowing down the efficiency of everyone in the office ."
"the things you do for this country are much too important to be delayed simply because you have an assistant who asked the wrong person or question ."
"not to mention the security risks associated with asking someone a question that might be outside of their clearance area ."
"the work you do is completely confidential and revealing something to the wrong person , even accidentally , could be a serious breach in security . ''"
"she was really getting into the swing of this , she thought ."
"that last comment was on the fly , not from her notes , but it sounded really good ."
"hassan sat back , amused but trying to hide it ."
"he 'd never interviewed someone who was trying to dissuade him from hiring them ."
"`` please continue . ''"
"she glanced down at her notes , looking very earnest and confident that she should n't do the job ."
"`` i do n't know the first thing about diplomacy ."
"you work with so many people and my honesty might slip out and ruin a plan you 've been working hard to develop . ''"
"she realized that he was listening to her and not getting angry ."
"was she convincing him ?"
"`` i really do n't get out much , i 'm a horrible introvert and you need someone who is good around people , someone who prefers to be surrounded by others and gets energized by being around people ."
"i actually avoid crowds , preferring a good book ."
"or even a not so good book , '' she said with complete honesty and a grimace because most of the books she read were what she called `` brain candy '' and dana was unapologetic about her reading preferences ."
"`` so all the parties and functions you need to attend , well , i 'd be trying to get out of them as much as possible not to mention being unable to converse intelligently on the latest best seller or cerebral tome of which the media thinks is the next best mind game to success . ''"
"`` is there anything else ? ''"
"`` my language skills are only passable , '' she explained lamely , worried about the amusement she was starting to detect in his voice and those damnable grey eyes that kept luring her out of her focus ."
"`` i 'm pretty good in french and english and of course i can speak arabic , '' she admitted ."
"`` but other languages i struggle with . ''"
"hassan nodded , paying more attention to her dancing brown eyes than her words , although he was still amused by her approach ."
"`` anything else ? ''"
"`` well ... '' she could n't think of anything else ."
"glancing down , she read through all of her notes and nothing else made sense ."
"she glanced up at him , wishing this were true but it was all she could think of ."
"`` i do n't really like you . ''"
"hassan was stunned at first ."
"then threw his head back and laughed , delighted with her refreshing attitude ."
"dana grimaced and thought quickly ."
"`` okay , so it is n't that i do n't really like you so much as i disagree with several of your policies ."
"number one is the fact that your country 's wealth is resting on the oil underneath your ground and that 's a fossil fuel that is changing the whole weather pattern of the earth and i 'd much rather drive an electric vehicle than damage the environment any longer ... '' she knew she was n't getting through to him and her voice slowly faltered to an awkward halt ."
"`` you start immediately , '' he said and stood up ."
"`` there are several meetings this afternoon ."
"you will sit in on them and take notes ."
"talk to omar about the other issues with the meetings and he 'll fill you in , '' he replied ."
"with that , he walked over to his desk , picking up several documents and handing them to her with instructions on what to do with each ."
"dana listened , stunned and horrified for several minutes before she realized that she should be writing down everything he was telling her ."
"she 'd already missed the first few instructions but scrambled quickly to turn things around , writing as fast as her fingers could move ."
"ten minutes later , she walked out of his office with her arms filled with files , contracts and instructions that she dumped onto her already crowded desk in her miniscule office ."
"as she stood back and looked at everything , she was stunned that the man had so much to do ."
"okay , so he ran a country ."
"literally ran a country ."
"but does n't he delegate anything ?"
"and why in the world had he hired her ?"
"had n't he listened to anything she 'd said ?"
"she was completely inappropriate for the job ."
"good grief , she 'd more than convinced herself that she was an idiot so why had n't he even blinked at the problems she 'd presented to him about her taking on the role ."
"with a sigh , she started with what she thought were the highest priority items and worked her way through each , referencing his instructions over and over again , unsure what to do in several situations but since she could n't find anyone to ask , apparently everyone was in some important , private meeting , she was on her own ."
"she 'd have to catch him when he 's thinking more clearly and then maybe he would let her step back into her previous position ."
"dana did the best she could but knew that she was probably missing the mark on several issues ."
"lunch time came and went and she did n't even realize that it was almost dinner time until hassan came out of the meeting ."
"with barely a nod in her direction , he disappeared once again into his office with his advisors and she clenched her teeth in an effort to not scream out that she had n't asked for , nor wanted , this job that was now making her stay late to get through all the worked he 'd piled on top of her narrow shoulders ."
"by nine o'clock that night she finished the last of his instructions ."
"as she turned off her computer , she poked her head out of her office and looked at the other desks , wondering when everyone else had left the office ."
"`` you 're here very late , '' hassan said from the doorway to his office ."
"he slowly walked down the hall until he was standing in front of her ."
"`` i hope you had dinner . ''"
"dana glanced down at her watch and sighed , all her hunger suddenly appearing now that she was n't frantically trying to get the work accomplished ."
"`` i 'll grab something when i get home . ''"
"he pushed away from the doorway and shook his head ."
"`` one of the perks of this position is having the kitchen on speed dial . ''"
"he looked down at her phone and lifted the receiver , pressing a button ."
"a moment later , he instructed that a sandwich be delivered immediately to her desk ."
"she tried to protest , not wanting to hang out here any longer , especially if he was going to be here as well ."
"all she wanted was to go home , curl up on her soft bed and fall asleep ."
"she did n't even care if she had dinner , because fatigue was her overwhelming issue right at the moment ."
"`` tell me what you 've accomplished today ."
"where are you on all the items we discussed this morning ? ''"
"dana picked up her notebook and glanced down at her notes , with all the additional scribbles she 'd notated throughout the day and accepting that she was n't getting out of here very soon ."
"she went through the issues , describing what she 'd done for each ."
"when she was finished , she took a deep breath and set her notepad back down on her desk , then glared back up at him , daring him to tell her she 'd done something wrong after all that ."
"she saw the surprise on his face but was n't sure what it indicated ."
"`` you finished everything from this morning ? ''"
"she blinked , confused ."
"`` of course . ''"
"he smiled slightly and shook his head ."
"`` the deadline for most of those items was the end of the week . ''"
"her mouth dropped open , shocked at the news that she 'd worked this hard for nothing ."
"`` are you kidding me ? ''"
"he laughed softly ."
"`` i never joke about work . ''"
"a knock on the door revealed a man with a tray and dana 's mouth immediately started watering at the sight of food ."
"`` that looks delicious , '' she sighed happily ."
"the man set the tray on the desk and dana ignored the gorgeous man standing there watching her eat ."
"she was too hungry to care at this point ."
"`` why did n't you tell me that stuff did n't need to be done by the end of today ? ''"
"`` you 'll start to understand the deadlines a bit more as you gain experience . ''"
"`` in the meantime , i 'm just going to have to guess ? ''"
"`` or ask . ''"
"`` who was i supposed to ask ?"
"no one was here . ''"
"`` you are my personal assistant now , dana ."
"feel free to interrupt me for further guidance . ''"
"she watched him carefully , wondering where that interruption line would be drawn ."
"her cell phone rang and she glanced down at the number but did n't recognize it ."
"she tucked it back into her purse , then wrapped up the rest of the sandwich after eating only a few bites ."
"`` thank you for dinner ."
"that was delicious . ''"
"it really had been a crazy day and although the sandwich had n't filled her up yet , it at least pushed the hunger pains away until she could create some space between herself and this man who made her body tremble slightly ."
"as she stood up , she was struck again by how tall the man was ."
"`` i 'll try very hard to do a good job . ''"
"`` even though you do n't like me . ''"
"she blushed and glanced down ."
"`` okay , so maybe i do n't really know you and i admitted that it is n't you that i disagree with but some of your policies . ''"
"she grimaced and shook her head again ."
"`` and maybe i 'm just too tired to realize that this is one of those moments when i really should n't speak out loud because i 'm too tired and worn out and i 'll probably say something i should n't ."
"i apologize your highness ."
"i was out of line . ''"
"he smiled , watching the soft pink blush stain her porcelain cheeks ."
"`` i 'd like to hear what you disagree with besides burning fossil fuels ."
"we 'll discuss those and other topics another time ."
"you look exhausted from today 's efforts but i 'm impressed that you finished an entire week 's worth of work in one day ."
"just goes to show that omar was right in selecting you for the role , '' he said and chuckled at her grimace as he started walking out the door ."
"when her phone rang again , she glanced at the number and frowned , pressing the `` ignore '' button ."
"it was the same number as before ."
"she looked up nervously and stuffed her phone into her purse ."
"`` boyfriend wondering why you are so late in coming home ? ''"
"hassan asked ."
"dana shook her head ."
"`` i do n't have a boyfriend , '' she said and stood up ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"she stepped around her desk , pretending to be busy looking for something in her purse ."
"`` i was just promoted and my boss is a slave driver , '' she joked ."
"he did n't laugh ."
"`` you 're a beautiful woman ."
"i ca n't believe that a man has n't captured your attention . ''"
"another blush , she really wished she could stop doing that ."
"if it were anyone else other than this man with his dark , mysterious eyes , she might be able to brush off the questions ."
"but this man made her nervous , which made her mind clumsy ."
"`` oh , i 've dated in the past . ''"
"`` just not anyone special right now ? ''"
"hassan was both intellectually and personally intrigued that some man had n't already snatched up a woman with dana 's spirit and beauty , not to mention her intelligence and integrity ."
"`` no ."
"definitely not , '' she replied , thinking of all the men who were chasing her , unfortunately not for the reason she wanted ."
"`` i 'd better get home ."
"you start work pretty early each morning . ''"
"hassan watched her leave , his eyes appreciating her slender waist and cute bottom once again ."
"there was just something about her bothered him ."
"he could tell she was hiding something , although what that was , he had no idea ."
"he was n't concerned that she was doing something illegal or unethical ."
"in order to work in the palace , all employees had to go through a rigorous background check so if there was a criminal or even questionable past , she never would have been considered for employment , much less allowed to enter the palace grounds ."
"shrugging away the mystery for now , he called the front gate ."
"`` make sure dana miller is escorted home safely , '' he said ."
"then as an afterthought , `` she might not like the interference so make sure she 's unaware of the escort . ''"
"he had no idea why he 'd done that ."
"employees and guests left the palace late all the time and he never ordered an escort for any of them ."
"why he 'd chosen to do that for his new assistant was yet another mystery he was too tired to figure out at the moment ."
"chapter 2 her cell phone rang once again and this time she was too distracted by the chaos of the morning to be cautious ."
"instead of checking the number first , she reached for it automatically ."
"`` hello , '' she said and grabbed the next contract for review , slapping it onto the center of her desk ."
"`` you 're a hard woman to find , '' a masculine voice whispered in her ear ."
"`` where have you been , little girl ? ''"
"dana 's fingers froze and she dropped the highlighter she 'd been gripping ."
"her hand clenched the cell phone and her lips tried to form a reply , but she was too frightened ."
"`` so are you going to tell me where you 're hiding ?"
"or am i going to have to do this the hard way ?"
"the more i have to wait , the worse it 's going to be for you , dearie . ''"
"dana snapped the phone closed and tossed it onto her desk , pushing away from her desk and staring at the phone as if it were poisonous ."
"`` dana ? ''"
"hassan asked as he was walking out of his office ."
"since she 'd been promoted , her office was now right outside of his and he stopped by often when coming or going from meetings to inform her of the next step or to give her additional instructions ."
"today , he stopped in front of her , concern in his eyes ."
"she did n't notice his look though since she was still staring at the phone ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"he demanded , his voice strong and confident ."
"dana reacted to the tone , her mind reaching for the strength and authority ."
"she needed him right now , so much she had to restrain herself from running into his arms and asking that he hold her tightly in his strong arms ."
"that would be completely inappropriate as an employee , she told herself even as she looked up at him longingly ."
"hassan had never seen her so frightened ."
"except in battle , he 'd never seen anyone as frightened as she was at the moment ."
"he tossed the papers he 'd been carrying onto her desk and walked around , taking her in his arms and holding her tightly against him ."
"he stood there until the shivers stopped and he heard her breathing return to normal , rubbing her back and soothing her with soft words and reassurance that everything would be okay ."
"this woman , with all of her feminist logic and soft heart , had gotten under his skin over the past two weeks ."
"every time she walked into his office , carrying the files in front of her like a shield and her soft cheeks blushing that gorgeous color when he looked at her , he wanted to pull her into his arms and kiss her ."
"he 'd never dared , reading the signals she was sending out that she was trying to be very businesslike about the situation ."
"and he respected that ."
"at least intellectually he respected that ."
"his body did n't really like it a whole lot though ."
"his body had very different ideas about the kind of relationship he wanted with her and lately , his body 's priorities were gaining in ascendancy while his mind controlled the situations only by a thread ."
"holding her like this , with her slender waist , soft breasts and silky cheek pressed against his chest and her unthinking trust that he would keep her safe , was making his gentlemanly instincts hard to maintain ."
"when her shaking settled down and he felt her arms loosen slightly , he looked down at her , but did n't release her ."
"he knew that he should probably step back and give her space , but she just smelled too dam good !"
"not to mention the way she curled into him and he did n't want to give that feeling up ."
"`` what happened ? ''"
"he asked softly ."
"dana almost told him ."
"he was so strong and so competent , surely he could keep her safe ."
"but at the last moment , she remembered the others whose entire career it was to keep people like her safe ."
"they were dead now and she 'd barely escaped ."
"she simply could n't tell him what had happened for fear that he could be hurt as well ."
"`` i saw a spider , '' she said lamely and pushed her cell phone into her pocket so he would n't guess that it had been a phone call ."
"hassan stared at her , knowing she was lying but not sure why ."
"`` a spider ? ''"
"he asked gently ."
"`` you are that terrified of spiders ? ''"
"he sat down on the desk behind him so his eyes were at her level ."
"she was achingly lovely even with no color in her skin and her lips being bitten painfully ."
"he reached up and touched her lip gently where she 'd been biting them a moment ago ."
"`` you really want me to believe that you react that strongly to a spider ? ''"
"she took a deep , shaking breath and looked away , hating lying to him ."
"`` i 'm sorry , that was very silly of me ."
"arachnophobia is n't pleasant . ''"
"he thought about challenging her claim , but knew that she was too stubborn ."
"whatever had caused this kind of fear had come through on the cell phone she was now hiding in the pocket of her slacks ."
"`` okay , '' he sighed and stood up , putting a hand on her shoulder ."
"`` i do n't see the spider around here any longer , but if another one comes around , do n't confront it , '' he said earnestly , hoping she would get the message that he did n't care if it was a spider or something much more malicious , he would help her ."
"`` call me for help and i will fix this , no matter how big or ugly the spider . ''"
"dana nodded and crossed her arms over her stomach protectively ."
"otherwise , she was likely to throw herself into his arm and sob out the whole horrific story and beg him to take care of the situation ."
"she thought she was safe here , had thought she 'd gotten far enough away that they could n't find her ."
"but now they had her cell phone and she 'd confirmed her identity by answering it without a thought , giving them her location ."
"`` thank you ."
"i 'll make sure to call you . ''"
"he walked away then ."
"he was too tempted to pull her into his arms and kiss her until she was delirious enough to tell him what was bothering her ."
"he shook his head as if that could actually happen ."
"she seemed a bit too logical for any man to be able to make her delirious ."
"he tossed the papers onto his desk and ran a hand through his hair ."
"something was wrong and he wanted to protect her but he did n't understand the problem ."
"it drove him crazy to not know ."
"picking up his phone , he dialed his head of security ."
"`` a call just came in to dana miller 's cell phone ."
"find out who it came from and let me know , '' he ordered ."
"dana enjoyed the morning sun on her face and rolled over on her bed , luxuriating in the fact that she could do so ."
"it had been a painfully hard week but today was sunday and she did n't have to work ."
"she was going to relax today and pretend that the calls had n't happened , that the man at the other end of the phone a few days ago had n't really found her and that she was a completely free and normal person who finally had day off and was loving the unexpected liberty ."
"deep inside , she accepted that she truly loved her new job ."
"and her feelings for her boss were a wee bit inappropriate ."
"she snuggled under the covers and groaned ."
"okay , they were more than a wee bit inappropriate ."
"she was fascinated by the man ."
"now that she sat in on meetings with him , she understood both the power he wielded as well as the enormous responsibility he had for his people and this country ."
"and it was a responsibility he took very seriously ."
"he was fair , but would n't let other countries take advantage of his people and he worked extremely hard to make sure odar 's growth continued and his goals were met ."
"she might be exhausted from the work schedule , but every time she felt tired , she looked over at hassan and knew that he worked even harder than she did and had much longer hours ."
"she arrived early each morning for work and left late , but no matter what time she got to her desk , he was already sitting at his own and there were several notes on her desk with instructions , which meant he 'd been up earlier than she was , and had most likely worked later than her the previous night ."
"there were many social events coming up next week so she hoped he would take some time to relax and enjoy the events ."
"the man worked much too hard , she thought and pushed the pillows behind her back ."
"she 'd heard him laugh twice this week ."
"and that sound had been so wonderful , it had made her stomach quiver with excitement and her heart had melted slightly ."
"she was definitely getting too emotionally involved and would have to work to keep things in perspective ."
"this was a sheik , a ruler who had a great deal of responsibility and did n't need her puppy love to get in the way of his daily routines ."
"ever since that day when he 'd held her in his arms , she 'd wondered what it would be like to be held by him in different ways ."
"inappropriate ways ."
"her heart raced as she pictured hassan slowly undressing her and making love to her ."
"she wished she had permission to touch his muscular body and explore ... .stop it !"
"this was getting completely out of hand , she told herself sternly ."
"she was his executive assistant , nothing more !"
"her new cell phone rang and she picked it up , glancing once more at the phone number ."
"she sighed and bit her lower lip , worrying about the fact that whoever was on that phone number had called her cell phone about ten times over the past several days ."
"this was n't someone who just kept dialing the wrong phone number ."
"or was she being silly ?"
"could someone just keep on trying the number ?"
"the message that answered was a computer and not her own voice so if they were calling erroneously , they 'd never know they might be reaching the wrong person ."
"the call went to voice mail again and she pushed the issue aside ."
"no one knew where she was right at the moment so she was being silly to think that someone had tracked her down so far away ."
"just in case , she made one call to her instructor , a man she 'd engaged to help her learn an essential skill for someone in her situation , and arranged to meet him for a lesson this afternoon ."
"by evening , she was exhausted , but in a different way ."
"the week had created a mental exhaustion but this was physical ."
"and every muscle in her body ached from overuse , some of which she had n't ever used before ."
"in fact , she had n't even known some of these muscles existed , she thought as she slid her sore body into the tiny tub of her apartment bathroom , sighing with happiness as the heat seeped into her muscles , relaxing and evaporating some of the pain ."
"or at least pushing it to the side ."
"her instructor had taken her through several new moves which could help in an attack ."
"she 'd made him go over the moves again and again until she 'd perfected them and could do any of them until she had them exactly on target and would hopefully become instinctive ."
"two years ago , she never would have considered learning hand to hand combat or defensive techniques ."
"but now it was an essential part of her life , something she honed each day and she also made sure she was aware of what was going on around her ."
"she hoped never to have to use any of the moves , but the phone calls were making her wary ."
"maybe she was n't as safe here as she 'd thought ?"
"perhaps she should move on ?"
"was she just being silly ?"
"could her job at the palace keep her out of the hands of the people she was trying avoid or was she just putting herself into a more dangerous situation ?"
"she was several thousands of miles away from home , away from the incident that had put her life in danger ."
"she just needed to relax and let herself enjoy life once again ."
"three days later , she was walking through the market , feeling excited and free since hassan had a dinner meeting with a group of diplomats tonight so he 'd sent her home early ."
"early meant she was gone by dinner time and was now strolling through the market , picking up the various fruits and vegetables for sale ."
"she had no idea what she wanted to make for dinner tonight , but she was going to chop and slice and dice and cook and her whole apartment would smell delicious ."
"she loved cooking but since her promotion , she 'd been at the palace until way after dinner , sometimes arguing with hassan about one policy or another and debating her opinion against his own ."
"the first time she 'd done that , she 'd been horrified that she 'd been so forward as to express her opinion to hassan ."
"but he 'd told her to take a seat and expound ."
"so she had ."
"and he 'd argued right back and she had lost track of time , enjoying the arguing with him too much ."
"but tonight , she was alone and she refused to become depressed about that situation ."
"she could n't believe that she was actually sad that she was n't at work , slaving away for the man ."
"the dichotomy of being excited about cooking but sad that she was n't working made no sense ."
"she should be exultant that she had the night off and could do whatever she wanted to do ."
"she picked up more vegetables , thinking of a rice and chicken dish her mother had taught her so many years ago might be a good idea ."
"the market might not have some of the spices though ."
"she bit her lip in concentration , trying to consider alternatives that would be more available in this part of the world ."
"she was picking up apples from a fruit vendor , putting some of them into a sack when something to the side of her made her glance right ."
"but when she did n't see anything , she shrugged and moved to gather pears and persimmons ."
"again , there was a strange movement , but when she looked , nothing was there ."
"was she being paranoid ?"
"she looked around , scanning the crowd and trying to see something that did n't fit ."
"dana knew when her instincts were warning her about something and right now , her gut was telling her to ... ."
"she did n't have time to finish that thought since two men approached her from opposite sides ."
"thankfully , she had been training for just such an event and did n't hesitate ."
"at the last moment , just as one of them reached out intending to swing at her , she ducked , then swung up with her arm in perfect form , catching one with her elbow just under the rib cage and the other man she smacked with her fist into his nose ."
"both men roared backwards , obviously unprepared for her to react like that ."
"as she looked around , she realized that one had a bloody nose and the other was clenching his oversized gut ."
"and both were furious with her ."
"she did n't wait around for introductions but swung her leg out , tripping one man and forcing him sideways ."
"the other had enough time to realize what she was doing and jumped at the last second ."
"so dana spun around and kicked with all her might , throwing him off balance ."
"and then , without compassion , she kicked upwards , aiming for and hitting a man 's most sensitive area ."
"the big man doubled over in pain which gave her enough time to focus on the other man who was now getting up from his tumble of moments before ."
"they glared at each other , both assessing the other 's next move ."
"dana knew that it was never good to wait ."
"with one hand , she reached out and grabbed the apples that were in the basket behind her ."
"as missiles , they were ineffective ."
"as distractions , they were perfect ."
"the man was too busy dodging the apples to attack , which gave dana the ability to get into position ."
"with his bleeding nose still gushing , she aimed one more apple at his head which caused both his hands to go up , protecting his face ."
"that gave her just enough time and she swung around for momentum , slamming her elbow into his kidney with as much strength as possible ."
"with both men doubled over in pain , she turned and was shocked to see a crowd of people standing there staring at her ."
"no time to wait around and explain , she dug into her purse and put some money on the vendor 's table , then dashed out of the market as fast as she could ."
"when she reached her car , she slammed it into gear and headed for the palace , trying to calm down enough to get through security ."
"by the time she reached the gates , she was able to at least present a calm facade even though her heart was racing overtime ."
"as she parked her car in the normal spot , she looked over at her passenger seat and had to laugh ."
"she 'd at least gotten through the marketplace with her groceries !"
"biting her lip , she looked at the employee entrance and tried to figure out what she could do ."
"she was here , inside the palace gates so she was safe at least for the moment ."
"the men obviously did n't know where she lived since they 'd attacked her in the busy market instead of at her apartment so that was a plus ."
"she 'd just have to be extra careful about getting to and from work for a while until she could figure out what to do and where to go next ."
"she 'd have to give notice to hassan , she thought and her heart cried out against that plan ."
"she could n't imagine going the rest of her life without seeing his stern expression or hear his chuckle when someone said something funny or ridiculous ."
"even if that comment was from her because he disagreed with her politics ."
"she did n't mind his amusement since every once in a while she was able to change his mind ."
"he would never admit that she 'd done so though ."
"she took a deep , shaky breath and focused on her current problem , pushing hassan and his humor out of the way so she could figure out her next move ."
"even though she did n't want to , leaving really was her only option ."
"she had to do it regardless of her feelings for the man himself ."
"he already had enough danger in his life , he did n't need her problems added onto them ."
"besides , she was fully capable of hiding from those men and she could n't hide in the palace forever ."
"pretty soon , they were going to find out where she lived ."
"if it meant running for the rest of her life , at least she 'd be alive to run ."
"it was n't much , but things could be worse ."
"at least this way , she 'd have a chance to see the world and experience more adventures ."
"however much she loved the desert and the brutal beauty of it , the amazing life that scurried throughout the desolate sands , it was time to move on ."
"she looked at the time and realized it was the early evening ."
"maybe she could use the palace kitchen tonight to make her dinner ."
"she would n't need a great deal of space , just a corner would work ."
"the meal was pretty simple and cooking always calmed her down ."
"she remembered several times when she and her mother would bake up a storm , the whole house smelled like cookies or garlic or whatever it was they decided to make that night ."
"it might have been a bad test grade or a traffic ticket ."
"it did n't mater the issue , cooking and baking always soothed the soul ."
"she stepped out of her car and locked it , actually shaking her head that she was concerned with someone stealing her car when her life was in danger ."
"she was in one hundred degree heat , she 'd probably short changed a fruit vendor after pinging a bad guy with his apples and she had two murderous thugs on her trail ."
"but do n't let anyone steal her precious car !"
"walking through the employee entrance , she greeted all the guards by name , asking about their wives or children and laughing when they told her cute stories ."
"as she walked by each check point , and heard about each new baby tooth or school grade , it gave her a sense that she was not only surrounded by security , but also by friends and that meant a great deal to her ."
"as she walked into the kitchen , she greeted one of the chefs nervously ."
"`` excuse me , but would you mind terribly if i used a small bit of space ? ''"
"the assistant looked her up and down and smiled , `` you 're the assistant to his highness , correct ? ''"
"she asked deferentially , appearing nervous to even ask the question as she bowed slightly , as if hassan 's position seemed to transfer to his staff in some way ."
"dana 's heart lifted ."
"perhaps there were some advantages to her new position after all ."
"besides being close to hassan , that is ."
"`` yes ."
"i just started a while ago ."
"i do n't know who has been doing it , but someone has been keeping me stocked with delicious foods recently ."
"it 's been wonderful to look up in the early afternoon and find a delicious meal all ready for me . ''"
"`` we are all happy to help out whenever his highness needs assistance , '' the kind woman said ."
"`` we would be happy to make you anything you 'd like , '' she said and glanced at the bag of vegetables in dana 's arms ."
"dana shook her head , hugging her precious parcels closer as if they were the crown jewels ."
"`` thank you so much for offering , but if it 's okay , i 'd like to just find a corner and lose myself in the process ."
"i do n't want to disturb anyone though ."
"if you 're busy trying to get things ready for a big event , '' she said , trying to think of who might be coming to the palace for dinner tonight , `` i 'll stay out of your way . ''"
"`` there 's plenty of room , '' the other woman said and led her to one of the tables in the corner , out of the way of the other palace food preparations ."
"`` there are utensils and knives over there , '' she said , pointing to a large wall filled with various knives , `` and the pots and pans are behind you ."
"any ingredients you might need can be found in the store rooms over to the left . ''"
"dana sighed with happiness as she pulled all of her vegetables out of her bag and sorted them in the order for chopping ."
"she selected a frying pan , a knife and cutting board and went to work , humming the latest hit to herself as she worked ."
"she felt good , she thought ."
"powerful even ."
"the men had found her and she 'd escaped with both men down ."
"she almost laughed at the expression on the one man 's face right after she 'd ducked and the two clowns had just about run into each other ."
"okay , so they were n't clowns ."
"and the guns she 'd seen under their jackets had been real and very deadly ."
"if she 'd been in a more isolated place , she had no doubt that she 'd be dead by now ."
"the men who had attacked her did n't appear to be the kind who would hesitate to kill a person if given the opportunity ."
"she had the impression that they would do whatever they needed to in order to get what they needed , which was why she was in this position in the first place ."
"-- - hassan looked up as two of his security forces walked into his office ."
"he 'd been expecting them as soon as he 'd gotten the phone call a half hour ago telling him that dana had been attacked in the market ."
"`` explain , '' hassan said to fudar , his jaw clenched and his anger simmering ever since that call ."
"his dana was in danger and he was furious that he had n't been there to protect her ."
"nor had these men been in a position to help her either , a further irritant that he meant to resolve as soon as he had enough information to form a plan ."
"the two men bowed but then straightened and looked their king in the eyes ."
"`` she was magnificent , your highness ."
"two men were coming at her from opposite sides and she knew exactly what to do ."
"she 's trained , although not very experienced . ''"
"fudar stood up straighter ."
"as the more senior of the two guards , it was his duty to relay the situation and he went into details about the attack and how they 'd apprehended the men who had dared to attack the woman under their care ."
"they finished the recitation by explaining , `` she had them on the ground in less than two minutes , sire . ''"
"`` she was hesitant to hurt them , sir , '' the second man said ."
"`` she 's a very gentle warrior . ''"
"`` fudar , '' hassan said , standing up and rubbing the bridge of his nose , `` explain to me how she was even allowed to be in danger . ''"
"`` you asked that we follow her but not let her know we were there , sir ."
"we were following her throughout the market and were busy detaining the other two men who had been following her initially ."
"we did n't know that there were four of them until the other two attacked her by the fruit vendors ."
"the two we currently have in custody are n't talking yet ."
"but they will . ''"
"`` fine . ''"
"he looked around , trying to calm down and hating the worry that was on him right now ."
"he wanted to announce to the world that this woman was his , but he had no claim on her other than as an employee ."
"regardless of how much his body wanted to possess her , she was off limits ."
"and then it hit him ."
"she 'd overcome two armed men ?"
"his sweet , gentle dana , the woman who had been crying about seeing a spider under her desk had won a fight with two men ?"
"he had to smile at the idea , not really able to imagine it happening ."
"`` tell me about her moves , '' he commanded and glared at the two men while he listened ."
"as they went through their descriptions , the simmering anger he had been feeling transformed slightly into pride ."
"the anger was still there , but it was tempered by the fact that she had come out of it unharmed ."
"`` and you say there 's not a bruise on her ? ''"
"`` no , your highness ."
"she was very good and kept them from even touching her in any way , '' fudar confirmed ."
"`` you escorted her home ?"
"and there 's a guard outside her apartment ? ''"
"fudar was already shaking his head ."
"`` she came right back to the palace , your highness ."
"she did n't veer towards her apartment in any way ."
"it was as if she knew that the palace was safer than her apartment ."
"she did well , thinking through the options , your highness . ''"
"his chest swelled with pride ."
"not only was his little woman a good fighter , she was also cool under pressure and thought through a tactical retreat ."
"`` she 's here ?"
"where is she ? ''"
"`` she is in the kitchen sir ."
"two guards are stationed outside each doorway and one is in the kitchen itself watching her ."
"we are still under orders to be inconspicuous , sire . ''"
"`` good ."
"do n't let her know we saw what happened in the marketplace ."
"i do n't know why , but she does n't want me to be aware that she 's in trouble ."
"any luck on tracking the call she received the other day on her cell phone ? ''"
"`` it came from new york city but the phone was a throw away , paid with cash at a small store ."
"untraceable . ''"
"`` no other leads ? ''"
"`` we are looking into her background , trying to find a reason someone would want to hurt her ."
"as yet , we do n't have any clues but we 'll continue to look . ''"
"`` good ."
"keep at it and let me know what you find out . ''"
"he rubbed his hand over his face and sighed ."
"`` in the meantime , i 'm going to try and find out who this spider is that is trying to get to her ."
"if i find out anything , i 'll convey the information to you as well . ''"
"the two men bowed themselves out of hassan 's office and he took a moment to consider his approach ."
"he needed to be careful and see what she might know ."
"he had to be gentle and understand how her mind worked so he could get around her defenses , but he would definitely get around them ."
"he did n't understand why , but this woman with her gregarious nature , her superior intelligence and her soft , innocent eyes that echoed in his heart had become important to him ."
"he might not like that fact , but it was his reality and he had learned to listen to these feelings ."
"she was very important to him and he meant to protect her , even if it meant protecting her from herself ."
"ten minutes later , he was striding into the kitchen ."
"he heard several pans drop and startled gasps but he ignored them , intent on finding his prey ."
"he found her in the corner and , as he approached , he enjoyed the gentle swaying of her hips that instantly made his body react ."
"he would have groaned if it was n't such an enjoyable sight ."
"`` what are you making ? ''"
"he asked as he watched the knife move expertly through some sort of green vegetable ."
"dana gasped and dropped her knife , looking around and finding the man who had been on her mind for the past thirty minutes ."
"`` what are you doing in the kitchen ? ''"
"she asked , horrified that he 'd caught her after the tough days he 'd had recently ."
"he definitely did n't need her problems , no matter how broad those magnificent shoulders were ."
"her hand automatically went up to her hair , wondering if the fight with those men had disturbed her appearance ."
"she probably looked like a mess ."
"she certainly felt like it , she thought with resignation ."
"he watched her carefully , looking for signs that she 'd been hurt but when she appeared to be okay , no bruises or scrapes and her eyes looked more worried about him than anything else , he relaxed slightly ."
"`` i heard you had a bit of a scuffle today . ''"
"she blinked in surprise ."
"`` how did you hear about that ? ''"
"he shrugged and came closer , stealing a piece of cucumber ."
"`` it 's my kingdom ."
"you 'd be surprised at what i find out . ''"
"she laughed and shook her head , her body still in fight mode but she tried to pretend otherwise ."
"`` no i would n't ."
"i type up your security briefings so i know exactly what 's going on ."
"and i do n't know how your mind does n't explode with the pressure . ''"
"she tried to distract him from his question ."
"it was a lame effort since the man never forgot anything and was only distracted if he wanted to be , and in those cases , he only allowed the person to think he was distracted until he came around to the problem again , from a different angle and with a different tactic ."
"he chuckled at both her worried expression and the relief he was feeling now that he could see that she genuinely was n't hurt ."
"`` what are you cooking ? ''"
"she nervously looked behind her at the table ."
"`` i was making stir fry , '' she explained ."
"`` i 'm sorry to be invading your chef 's space like this ."
"i just thought that your kitchen might be more equipped than my own . ''"
"she bit her lower lip , hoping to stop the trembling she knew was coming as he looked down at her ."
"she 'd never been a good liar and this was no exception , especially with those dark , sexy eyes looking down at her as if he knew what color underwear she was wearing ."
"hassan nodded and watched her pretty white teeth bite down on her lip ."
"a lip he 'd like to be biting , he thought ."
"and tasting ."
"and doing a whole lot more with ."
"regardless , it was a big indicator that she was lying to him ."
"her eyes were telling him the same message ."
"`` mind if i help ? ''"
"he asked and walked over to the wall of knives and picked one for himself ."
"she was astonished that he actually wanted to assist her in food preparation ."
"`` um ... okay , '' she thought quickly , trying to figure out how to get him away ."
"it was n't that she did n't want him to help her , but hassan being this close , and this strong and sturdy and confident and ... .well , just magnificent , she was afraid she might break down and tell him everything and ask him for help ."
"which would be foolish and selfish ."
"he waved his hand towards one of the other helpers in the kitchen and immediately a young man raced over , wiping his hands on his apron even as he bowed to hassan ."
"`` how can i be of assistance , your highness ? ''"
"`` tell the chef to bring a bottle of wine that would be appropriate for stir fry and two glasses , '' he said and the man nodded quickly and raced away , eager to do the sheik 's bidding ."
"`` do you even know how to cook ? ''"
"she asked as she pulled out another cutting board for him ."
"`` i know how to use a knife , '' he replied and spun the blade around in his hand , setting it twirling around and around until it stopped impressively with the handle securely in the palm of his hand ."
"`` how hard can it be ? ''"
"he asked and stole another piece of cucumber ."
"`` it looks like all you do is chop until you 're bored out of your mind , then ask someone else to do the rest . ''"
"she tried smacking his hand away but he was too fast and he only winked at her as she rolled her eyes ."
"`` how did you learn to use a knife ? ''"
"she asked , handing him some peppers ."
"`` combat training , '' he said as if everyone in the world knew that and also took lessons ."
"`` all sheiks learn to throw a knife with deadly accuracy in preschool ."
"while other kids are learning their alphabet , we 're learning to defend our country . ''"
"he was just about to cut the pepper when she snatched it away , glaring back at him ."
"`` what do you mean , combat training ? ''"
"he shrugged and twirled the knife around again , then stabbed it , point down , into the wooden cutting board ."
"`` sometimes we use knives , other times sticks or whatever weapon is handy ."
"sometimes all of them . ''"
"despite herself , dana was fascinated ."
"she handed the pepper back to him ."
"`` can you dice this up into small squares ? ''"
"`` of course . ''"
"he took it back and glared at the vegetable as if it were an alien ."
"but he refused to back down from his confident declaration and she was amused despite the afternoon she 'd just endured ."
"she watched him for a moment but had to laugh as he immediately started chopping it up , seeds , core and all ."
"`` wait , '' she said and came around to his side of the table to show him how it was done ."
"`` here , you have to take the insides out ."
"they are n't edible . ''"
"she stepped to his side and took the now dissected pepper and showed him how to cut out the top and seeds and all the white parts inside ."
"`` why are they in there then ? ''"
"he asked impatiently ."
"`` that 's the secret to cooking i guess . ''"
"she shrugged and tried to scoot away since his nearness was making her nervous ."
"a completely different nervousness from earlier today ."
"`` where are you going ? ''"
"he asked softly and both his arms came around her as he took the pepper in one hand and the knife in the other ."
"`` show me , '' he said , his head bent low so that his deep voice was directly in her ear ."
"she shivered and looked up at him , noticed the waiting , expectant look and took a deep breath ."
"wrong idea , she thought as her head filled with his delicious , sexy scent and she had to concentrate hard to figure out what she was supposed to be doing ."
"pepper !"
"right , dicing the pepper , she reminded herself ."
"`` here , you have to do it like this , '' she explained and sliced neat lines from the top to the bottom of the pepper , `` then turn the slices and cut them up into squares , '' showing him how to dice the vegetable ."
"`` like this ? ''"
"he asked softly and took the knife and pepper out of her hands , his fingers sliding along her skin and causing another shiver to ripple along her arms and spine ."
"he took it and almost expertly started dicing it up ."
"she stepped away quickly and nodded ."
"`` yes , that 's exactly it , '' she said , wishing she did n't sound so breathless ."
"she moved back around to her side of the table and started cutting up the onions , moving quickly so she did n't start tearing up ."
"it would be just wonderful if , on top of her crazy hair and whatever else she looked like , she cried and smeared her makeup so she had black streaks coming down her face ."
"`` where did you learn to cook like this ? ''"
"he asked and took another vegetable , chopping that up the same way ."
"dana watched him , suspicious now that he was doing this so expertly ."
"`` my mother and i grew up cooking together ."
"we loved experimenting with different types of foods and meals . ''"
"she watched him for several moments , then put her hands on her hips , glaring at him ."
"`` you 've done this before , have n't you ?"
"that whole 'show me ' thing is just a plot to ... '' she was n't sure how to phrase it since it was probably just a mild flirtation on his part but in her mind , it had been so much more sensuous ."
"`` where is your mother ? ''"
"he asked , and by the stunned look on her face , he already knew the answer ."
"he wished he 'd never asked the question because all the laughter was gone , replaced by a sadness that made him want to take her into his arms and kiss away whatever pain she was dealing with ."
"`` my parents both died in a car accident while i was in college . ''"
"she said it quietly and picked up her knife , chopping up the celery into careful , even slices ."
"she put all of her effort into not crying in front of hassan ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he said softly ."
"she shrugged and shook her head ."
"`` it was a drunk driver , a stupid kid who thought he could have a few beers and make it home ."
"he 's fine , by the way ."
"off in college and having a good time ."
"probably still drinking and then getting into a car . ''"
"`` that 's horrible ."
"it was murder , no matter how one looks at it and i 'm truly sorry that this happened to you , dana . ''"
"she took some broccoli and started chopping it up , his sympathy truly did help ."
"in others , it had been a burden , but hearing those words from hassan made her feel better ."
"less alone , somehow ."
"`` it was a long time ago . ''"
"she missed her college friends , sasha and jenna who had been there for her every step of the way while she arranged the funeral and worked through all the details ."
"it had been horrible but having them there , like sisters always willing to offer a shoulder to cry on , had been her saving grace ."
"she really needed both of them now , but she would n't dare contact them for help ."
"he raised his eyebrow at that , knowing she was only twenty five so `` in college '' meant only a few years ago ."
"`` they would be proud of the woman you 've turned out to be , '' he said and grabbed a red pepper , chopping that up the same way as the green one ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"she felt awkward after that and struggled for something to say ."
"instead , she focused on cooking which always soothed her ."
"`` okay , so let 's put everything into the pan and grill it up . ''"
"she tossed all the vegetables into the center of the pan and took it over to one of the burners ."
"she 'd already set the rice to boiling before she started the vegetables so that was almost done ."
"with a bit of spices , a little oil and soy sauce , along with a secret ingredient she and her mother had worked on together , she tossed the vegetables around in the center of the pan , quick frying them all together until they were the perfect crunchiness ."
"throughout all this , she had to keep pushing hassan 's hand out of the way since he continuously tried to swipe the chopped vegetables or just get in her way ."
"she thought about putting her hands on his waist or shoulders and moving him out of the way , but that was much too forward ."
"she did n't have the courage to touch him in that way ."
"which was n't to say that she did n't want to ."
"that was a no brainer !"
"when the meal was finally cooked , she placed it on a plate with a heaping serving for him ."
"`` are you sure you want this for dinner ?"
"i 'm sure whatever the chef is cooking for you would probably be better . ''"
"`` come along , '' he said and took the bottle of wine and glasses in one hand and his plate in the other ."
"he led the way out of the kitchen , down one of the ornately decorated hallways and into a small sitting room she 'd never seen before ."
"`` what is this ? ''"
"she asked and hesitated to sit in one of the luxurious looking chairs ."
"`` this is my private sitting room ."
"relax , '' he said and gestured for her to take a seat in one of the large , overstuffed chairs ."
"`` let 's eat , '' he sat down across from her and poured both of them a glass of white wine ."
"the meal was just as delicious as she remembered it but she was worried when he took his first bite , wondering how anything she could cook could possibly compete with something one of his cordon bleu trained chefs would prepare ."
"but the surprised look on his face told her that he genuinely liked the meal and she relaxed into the velvet chair , taking a bite herself ."
"`` this is incredibly good , '' he said and took another bite ."
"`` thank you . ''"
"he asked her about her parents and she told him funny stories about christmases and halloweens from her past ."
"she then got him to open up about his parents and she felt sad that he seemed to have such a lonely childhood , filled with tutors and trainers , but not very many hugs and kisses while he grew up ."
"he had funny stories to tell of some of the servants and before she knew it , she 'd finished off most of her plate and he was completely done ."
"he kept pouring her wine and she relaxed even more as she sank into the chair , slipping her shoes off and tucking her feet underneath her ."
"they talked until well into the night and dana had never realized what a funny man hassan could be ."
"it was like he was a different person when he was outside of the office and as she looked across at him , after her third glass of wine , she thought she must really be falling hard for this guy ."
"with that thought came a horrifying realization ."
"there was no way she could fall for hassan ."
"she was on the run and had to find a new place to hide out ."
"hassan was off limits ."
"good grief , even if she was n't trying to hide away from people attempting to kill her , she still should n't fall for a man like hassan ."
"he was a sheik !"
"he ruled a country while she was a lowly secretary with no family and no ties to anyone who could help him ."
"she sat up straight and looked at her watch ."
"`` goodness , it 's after ten o'clock ."
"i really need to be going home ."
"i work for a horrible man who wo n't allow any slackers in his midst . ''"
"he laughed at the joke but shook his head ."
"`` you ca n't drive home tonight , '' he said and took her glass of wine , setting it on the table beside her ."
"he took her hand and pulled her out of the chair ."
"`` you 'll stay here tonight , '' he said softly and put an arm around her shoulder ."
"`` i know your employer would n't like you driving home after all the wine you 've consumed . ''"
"`` i 'll catch a cab , '' she argued ."
"even sleeping here in the palace was too close to hassan ."
"the idea just seemed too intimate ."
"besides , what would the others in the palace say tomorrow when they heard hassan had been cooking with her in the kitchens , then they disappeared into his private domain only for her to have to spend the night in the palace ?"
"not to mention she did n't have any other clothes here to change into for tomorrow 's work day ."
"but he was already shaking his head , denying the possibility ."
"`` a cab would n't be allowed into the compound ."
"you 'll stay here . ''"
"she thought frantically , really not wanting to stay here tonight ."
"her own bed would be much better ."
"much more appropriate ."
"`` could n't one of your security guys drive me home ? ''"
"`` they 're all asleep by now , '' he lied ."
"`` you 'll sleep in one of the guest suites and i wo n't hear any more arguments . ''"
"`` but how will i get a change of clothes for tomorrow ? ''"
"`` i 'll have one of the guards head over to your house and pack you a bag , '' he explained , completely refuting his claim that the guards were all asleep by this point in the evening ."
"dana tried to concentrate , but his arm was around her waist and she was being led to the next room where a large , beautiful bed was waiting for her ."
"`` i do n't have anything to sleep in , '' she said lamely ."
"hassan instantly pictured her sleeping in the nude and his body was not impressed with the torture it was going through ."
"`` you 'll find everything you need in the bathroom ."
"just relax and get a good night 's sleep . ''"
"he closed the door and dana sighed as she sank down onto the soft bed ."
"she was asleep before she could tell him she had a second thought ."
"chapter 3 the following day , things were their usual crazy pace ."
"she scurried to keep up with hassan 's work schedule , completing all the issues as quickly and efficiently as possible while still following behind him so she could sit in on his meetings and take notes ."
"she did n't want him to think she was taking advantage of last night 's dinner conversation by slacking off now so she worked extra hard to make sure things were right and he was prepared for whatever meeting was coming up next before he even asked for the information ."
"by the end of the day , she was exhausted , but also terrified of going back to her apartment ."
"surely those guys had discovered where she lived by now ."
"if they 'd found her at the market , it was just a hop , skip and a jump to her apartment complex ."
"she was determined to head back there though , not wanting to be intimidated by men even though they were trying to kill her ."
"she realized it was a silly thought since , if there was anyone she should be afraid if it was a group of guys with guns pointed at her ."
"it was essential that she head home though so she could figure out her next step ."
"she had to get onto her personal computer and figure out where she might go next ."
"she also needed to draft up her letter of resignation , although what she could possibly say in that she had no idea ."
"`` thank you for the most exciting few weeks of my life but i have to move on because goons are trying to kill me . ''"
"that just did n't sound like the right note for her departure ."
"she also doubted hassan would allow her to leave if he ever found out she was being chased by bad guys ."
"she might be just an employee , but he was very protective , she 'd discovered recently ."
"she thought about how concerned he was after she 'd gotten that phone call and smiled , pleased that he was willing to give her a shoulder to cry on , even if it was only because of a ridiculous spider story ."
"she shut down her computer and packed up , grabbing her purse and digging through the pockets to find her keys ."
"`` where do you think you 're going ? ''"
"hassan demanded , hands on his hips as he glared at her through her doorway ."
"she looked confused and glanced down at her bag , wondering if she was taking something she should n't ."
"`` i was going home for the night . ''"
"he immediately shook his head and stepped closer , his face looking furious that she would dare something so insane ."
"`` no ."
"you 're staying here . ''"
"she was so surprised by his command that she stepped back ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"he stepped into her office , refusing to back down ."
"`` you heard me ."
"you 're staying here ."
"after the battle in the marketplace yesterday , you 're not leaving until my men can track down what 's going on . ''"
"he leaned his hands on the desk and looked down at her ."
"`` you could save us all a lot of time if you 'd just tell me what 's going on . ''"
"she pushed her chair back slightly , needing the space ."
"`` nothing is going on ."
"how did you know about the guys yesterday ? ''"
"she looked up at him warily , wondering what he knew and how he had found out ."
"the marketplace was on the other side of town and she had typed up his security notes ."
"the brawl in the marketplace had n't even rated a footnote ."
"his eyes accidentally glanced down at her breasts which were pushing against the fabric of her suit ."
"he did n't mean to , but in her nervousness , her breathing had intensified and her breasts were heaving , an issue he did n't mind , but he wished it were for a different reason ."
"he softened his tone , but would n't budge on her leaving the palace ."
"that was an absolute not-going-to-happen idea ."
"`` i told you yesterday , i know a lot more than you think . ''"
"she was n't leaving here unless he could be assured of her safety , and her return on the following day ."
"and if there was some way he could keep her here inside the palace walls , even with the assurance of her safety and return , he was going for that scenario , liking it a whole lot better ."
"he had n't slept well last night , knowing that her soft body was curled up in the bedroom next door ."
"hell , he 'd wanted her soft body curled up next to him ."
"and he wanted to disrupt her sleep ."
"over and over again as he made love to her while she was curled up next to him ."
"`` what do you know ? ''"
"`` i know that four guys tried to attack you and you beat them down . ''"
"`` four guys ?"
"but there were only two of them yesterday . ''"
"`` so you admit you were attacked ?"
"and that was why you were so upset that you were in my kitchen cooking ? ''"
"`` i told you , i was in your kitchen because it was better equipped than mine . ''"
"he sighed and glared down at her ."
"`` you were in my kitchen because it was inside the palace walls and you knew you were safer here than anywhere else ."
"which was brilliant of you , by the way ."
"if i 'd found out you 'd done anything else , i might just paddle you . ''"
"she started to say something but he stopped her with a hand in front her ."
"`` and you were in the kitchen cooking because that activity makes you feel better ."
"it makes you feel in control and it soothes you so do n't even try and tell me that yesterday 's attacks did n't frighten you because i know you better now and i wo n't permit you to deny it . ''"
"she shook her head , her hands fisted at her sides as her mind worked frantically to come up with a reason he might accept for yesterday 's attacks ."
"something that would n't make him angrier , or keep her inside the palace walls for her protection ."
"`` they were just trying to get my wallet . ''"
"he was livid that she was trying to lie to him , but tempered that emotion by trying to figure out why she was lying ."
"dana was too kind and generous to be malicious in anything she did ."
"`` what were the other two men doing ? ''"
"she looked back up at him ."
"`` what other two men ? ''"
"`` i told you there were four of them ."
"only two thugs reached you and tried to attack you by the fruit stands ."
"the other two brutes that my security detail caught just as they were about to enter the fight were out of your line of sight , but no less dangerous if they had n't been stopped in time ."
"do you honestly think you could have fought off four armed men yesterday ? ''"
"the idea sent shivers down her back but she resisted the fear that started to invade her mind ."
"`` i sure could have tried . ''"
"her comment infuriated him because it was so ridiculous ."
"she could have been hurt , captured , kidnapped or raped and she was still thinking she could take on a gang of men trying to take her down ?"
"`` think so , huh ?"
"okay , come with me , '' he said and grabbed her hand , pulling her out of her office and down a long hallway ."
"she released her purse , quickly letting it fall back into her desk drawer ."
"`` where are we going ? ''"
"she asked , almost out of breath since his legs were much longer than hers and she could tell he was extremely angry ."
"in fact , she did n't think she had ever seen him this furious before ."
"hassan had always been the epitome of control and self-discipline ."
"`` we 're going to my gym . ''"
"he pushed through a large door and dragged her into the middle of the padded floor ."
"`` okay ."
"show me what you 've got . ''"
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"she stood there , her heels sinking into the blue padding and the bright lights shining down onto his furious facade ."
"he shook his head ."
"`` do n't be polite ."
"i 'm about to attack you ."
"show me what you did to those men yesterday . ''"
"she backed up a step and clasped her hands in front of her ."
"`` hassan , i 'm not going to attack you . ''"
"`` you 're not leaving the palace tonight then ."
"or any night until you can prove to me that you can fight off four men ."
"i 'm only one man ."
"if you can pin me down , we 'll talk . ''"
"he was so furious that she was going to put herself in danger that he had to do something , to show her that she was n't as invincible as she thought she was ."
"`` i 'm not going to fight you , '' she whispered ."
"just the idea of putting her hands on him made her stomach flutter wildly ."
"`` then prepare to spend a lot of nights here , '' he said , circling around her ."
"she 'd had enough ."
"she flipped off her shoes and picked them up , heading towards the door of the gym ."
"`` i 'm going home . ''"
"he quickly stepped in front of her and she stopped immediately ."
"`` only if you can get around me . ''"
"she shivered and backed up again ."
"`` hassan , this is silly . ''"
"he leaned down and shook his head , trying to emphasize to her what kind of danger she might be facing ."
"he knew since he 'd been in those situations before ."
"and the thought of her beautiful skin being marred even slightly by someone out to hurt her made him just a bit crazy with worry and anger ."
"`` no , what 's silly is you trying to take on two burly men intent on killing you ."
"and ridiculous is you not telling me about it as soon as you 'd returned to the palace last night ."
"i even asked you about it while we were in the kitchen and you still would n't confide in me , which makes this whole thing worse and leads me to think that even you know how dangerous this situation is ."
"what 's further insane is you not asking me for help so i can fix this for you . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` please , just let me go , '' she whispered , unable to look him in the eye ."
"she loved the fact that he was offering her help , that he cared enough to stop her from leaving ."
"it was so sweet that he was being strong for her , but she could n't burden him with her problems ."
"no matter how much she wanted to ."
"he was so strong , so powerful and so incredibly handsome ."
"all she wanted to do was lean her head against his muscular chest and cry out her fear and frustration ."
"but she had to be strong and rely only on herself ."
"`` not a chance , '' he said and came closer , his tone not softening even as he saw how upset she was becoming ."
"he had to make her realize that she was n't safe outside the palace walls ."
"`` what 's wrong , dana ?"
"think you 're bullet proof ? ''"
"`` of course not . ''"
"now he was just making her angry ."
"the concern she could handle ."
"the taunting , that just irritated her ."
"he pushed her shoulder slightly and she fell back ."
"`` are you afraid of me ? ''"
"she got angry with that push and glared back at him ."
"`` hassan , stop this ."
"there 's nothing you can do . ''"
"`` i can stop you from leaving the palace . ''"
"that pushed her anger into fury ."
"no one was going to control her ."
"no matter how handsome and sexy he was !"
"`` no you ca n't . ''"
"he leaned forward ."
"`` want to bet ?"
"the only way you 're getting out of here is if you can beat me ."
"and i definitely am not going to let you win . ''"
"she stood up straighter , fighting down the insecurities that were pressing against her ."
"`` please , '' she gasped ."
"`` you 're making me nervous . ''"
"`` good ."
"so you 're going to admit that you ca n't fight me and stay here ? ''"
"she stepped back again ."
"`` i wo n't fight you . ''"
"he pushed her again ."
"`` would it help if i made you angry ?"
"because i 'm pretty angry myself right about now . ''"
"`` stop pushing me , '' she said and backed up another step ."
"`` no , '' he replied with outward calm and pushed her shoulder again ."
"dana stumbled and tried to push down the rising anger ."
"`` leave me alone , hassan ! ''"
"she said and tried to walk around him ."
"`` make me , '' he countered and easily stepped in front of her ."
"she glared back ."
"`` this is ridiculous ! ''"
"she tried to push past him but he stepped in front of her again ."
"he grabbed her arm and twisted her around ."
"`` what 's ridiculous is you thinking you can solve this problem on your own . ''"
"`` i 'm not trying to solve it !"
"i 'm just ... . ''"
"`` you 're just trying to put yourself in danger and i 'm not going to allow that . ''"
"he pinned her back up against the wall and glared down at her ."
"`` come on , dana ."
"give it your best shot . ''"
"she glared right back up at him , wanting desperately to show him what she could do ."
"it was now a matter of pride ."
"`` i do n't want to hurt you , hassan , '' she said , giving him one last warning ."
"hassan was so surprised that she honestly thought she could hurt him that he threw back his head and laughed ."
"she was such an innocent and had no idea of what really happened in this world ."
"she thought she understood only because she had n't had enough experience of how cruel the world could be ."
"a moment later , he was lying on is back , staring up at her worried face with her fingers tangled in his ."
"`` are you okay ?"
"i 'm so sorry !"
"i did n't mean to hurt you , '' she hurriedly said and tried to feel his head to make sure he was okay ."
"with a quick flick of his wrist , he 'd flipped her over so she was lying on top of him but they did n't stay that way ."
"she nudged him in the elbow and he let her scramble away ."
"but he jumped up , coming at her with a determined look on his face ."
"`` hassan , i think i 've proven that i can take care of myself ."
"so just back away , '' she claimed and he caught her glance towards the doorway ."
"`` i would n't advise that plan , '' he said and instantly caught her attack , his arm catching her around her waist as she tried to zip past him ."
"dana 's breath was knocked out of her , not because of anything he 'd done but by the fact that he was much faster than she 'd anticipated ."
"`` okay , you asked for it , '' she said and twisted around , trying to knock him back down ."
"unfortunately , her plan backfired and she was twisted around so that her back was pressed against his chest and her arms were twisted around her stomach ."
"she was trapped ."
"`` are you giving up ? ''"
"he asked , his voice dangerously close to her ear ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she gasped and kicked her legs out ."
"he 'd anticipated that and with one quick move , he lifted her a few inches higher so that her feet kicked out to thin air ."
"`` give it up , dana ."
"the suite you slept in last night is at your disposal . ''"
"`` you 're not making me stay here ."
"it is n't ... . ''"
"she was about to say safe , but that would mean admitting that she was in danger and he 'd never let her out of the palace ."
"`` you 're hurting me , '' she said with a gasp and a softer tone ."
"as predicted , he instantly released her and she took advantage of his soft spot by grabbing his arm and twisting it around ."
"she could have elbowed him or even kneed him at that point , but she honestly did n't want to hurt him so she went for a weak third option she 'd only tried twice with her instructor ."
"and failed miserably ."
"with a quick flip , she was laying on her back , her legs held captive by his and her arms up over her head where they could n't do any more damage ."
"in fact , she could barely breathe with his body pressing her against the mat ."
"`` give up , '' he said , his voice husky as he looked down at her ."
"`` even that last move was n't performed well , dana ."
"and you knew of several other ways to hurt me but you 're too sweet and gentle to have done that ."
"admit that you 're in danger and let me help you . ''"
"dana was n't sure what to say ."
"she could feel all of him , his whole body pressed against hers and her mind screamed out for more ."
"she looked into his eyes and saw the desire flare in his eyes ."
"she could n't hide her own response and he saw her give in at exactly the same moment that his body realized that he was being cushioned by her soft warmth ."
"her breathing increased , but not from exertion ."
"it was all because of the heat racing through her , the hot , almost painful desire that made her body arch slightly , causing his hardening body to press exactly in the right spot ."
"her legs , which were already slightly apart because of his pinning , now pressed against his thighs , holding instead of resisting ."
"hassan saw all the signs and felt her body 's response and he could n't deny his own body 's need to have this woman ."
"just one kiss , he told himself ."
"and if she resisted at all , he 'd back off and apologize ."
"he tentatively touched her lips , feeling her softness , the tenderness of her full lips ."
"and when they moved underneath his , he denied himself no longer ."
"the kiss that had started out tentative , exploring , changed to something much more demanding ."
"he could n't hold back , had been doing that for several weeks now and his body was demanding total submission of this woman underneath him ."
"with a groan , he shifted slightly , changing his position subtly from imprisoning , to capturing , shifting just so and he loved her gasp of pleasure and the way her body arched up into his , pressing her softness more firmly against him ."
"he deepened the kiss and moved against her mouth , demanding that she open to him , his tongue tasting , coaxing until her lips opened and he could fully taste her ."
"when her tongue tentatively touched his own he went wild with desire and victory that she was feeling the same things he had been enduring ."
"dana was no longer thinking ."
"she was only feeling , amazed at how perfectly his body fit against hers ."
"she wanted this man like she 'd never wanted any other man before ."
"she 'd never felt like this and was going on instinct , moving against him , feeling him respond and reveling in the power she had to make this powerful man move ."
"she shifted again and he pulled her hands down , dropping her wrists so he could pull his hands on her waist , pressing her body against him ."
"his hands moved up and down her back , rolling her to her side so he could pull her leg up against his hip , pressing his erection against her heat more closely ."
"her fingers against his skin were like a feather caress , tentative , exploring and exciting in their softness ."
"he did n't hesitate to pull her blouse out of her slacks , his one hand moving and feeling her perfectly soft skin , amazed at how she reacted with each new piece of skin he discovered ."
"when his hand moved higher , she not only did n't resist , she turned slightly in unspoken invitation ."
"he did n't reject that invitation , pressing his hand higher , feeling her firm breast encased in lace and he groaned out loud with how perfect she was ."
"her breast fit perfectly in his hand , not too small and just slightly too large ."
"when his thumb found her nipple and flicked against the hard nubbin , she cried out and grabbed his wrist , holding very still for a long moment , her eyes closed and her teeth clenched ."
"hassan watched in fascination as she worked through that sensation ."
"he almost lost control though when she relaxed slightly , and then pressed his hand against her breast again , telling him without words to do it again ."
"she released his wrist and waited ."
"when his thumb flicked her nipple again , her fingers were in his hair , pulling against him while her hips arched against his erection ."
"his hand moved down her body , cupping her bottom and pressing her more closely against him and he rubbed her , mimicking the movements of making love and he swore when he realized they were both fully clothed ."
"with a smooth movement , he stood up with her in his arms ."
"dana was n't sure where he was taking her ."
"all she cared about was the fact that she was still in his arms and she could see the desire in his eyes ."
"when he pushed his way through a large door , she did n't care where they were ."
"he did n't stop until they were in a bedroom , not her own , but one that she did n't recognize and did n't care at all about the owners ."
"he was letting her legs fall down and she did n't like that at all , until he pulled her into his arms again , his hands sliding under her shirt once again and finding both breasts , his thumbs flicking against her nipples and she grabbed hold of his shoulders while her head fell backwards in reaction ."
"`` do n't stop , '' she begged and pressed her breast against his hand , wanting more ."
"`` do n't worry , '' he replied raggedly and swiftly unbuttoned her shirt , tossing it behind him ."
"when her breasts were finally revealed , he stared for all of five seconds , amazed at her perfection ."
"`` you 're beautiful , '' he said and bent his head to take the first one in his mouth ."
"if dana thought that his fingers could work magic , she was shocked by the heat of his mouth against her breast ."
"he pulled the lace of her bra out of the way and his mouth covered her hard nipple , his tongue flicking , his teeth nibbling and then sucking against her , making her scream with the need for more ."
"her hands were desperate themselves , pulling at his shirt and almost ripping the fabric in a desperate desire to find his skin , feel him like he was doing to her ."
"`` not yet , '' he said and pulled her hands away ."
"he tossed his shirt off himself then unbuttoned the snap on her slacks ."
"when they fell to the floor around her feet , he simply lifted her up and placed her in the center of the bed , leaving her black heels on while he tossed his own slacks off ."
"moments later , he joined her on the bed and dana was disappointed that she did n't have a chance to look at him , to see what she 'd been feeling all this time ."
"but then his hands and mouth were back , traveling down her body and she did n't care anymore ."
"he was here , he was touching her ."
"that was what was important ."
"his mouth traveled down her body , stopping each time he found a spot that made her shiver and giving it extra attention ."
"when he reached her thighs , she held them closed and grasped his shoulders but he shook his head ."
"`` not yet , '' he said and kissed the top of her right thigh ."
"`` open up for me , dana , '' he rasped and kissed her left thigh ."
"`` come back up , '' she said and shivered when he kissed a spot right near her hip bone ."
"`` you 're trying to win again and it wo n't work any better than it did earlier ."
"just let me have my way , '' he said and his hand moved to her knees , caressing her skin and making her shiver ."
"he bit her on her thigh , not hard enough to hurt , but enough to surprise her and when she jumped , her legs moved ."
"it was all the space he needed and he shifted his large body so he was exactly where he wanted to be ."
"`` see ?"
"i always have my way , '' he replied with a smile a moment before his mouth kissed the inside of her thigh , giving her fair warning of what he was going to do ."
"when he smelled her scent , he almost could n't slow down ."
"but he could feel her nervousness and tried to be patient , to ease her into something she was obviously uncomfortable with ."
"but he was n't going to relent ."
"he was so turned on by her scent and he was n't going to give in until he could taste her and watch as she achieved an orgasm with him ."
"his mouth kept moving closer to his goal and he ignored her fingers that were clutching at his hair , trying to move him away ."
"he was n't going to allow it though and when he finally achieved his goal , dana cried out and stopped fighting him , terrified of what she was feeling ."
"what he was doing to her was so intense , so intimate that she gasped with the shock of it all ."
"a moment later , her body was shifting about , trying to get more and a desperate , tearing need to find something was making her writhe under his fingers ."
"when he simply grabbed her hips and did what he wanted , she could n't hold out any longer , her body exploding and shaking , arching up against his mouth as her eyes closed and her body came to life as she never knew it could ."
"long minutes later , she opened her eyes and looked up , right into the smiling , satisfied features of hassan as he watched her orgasm subside ."
"`` wow , '' she said in a reverent whisper ."
"he laughed softly and nodded ."
"`` wow , indeed . ''"
"she felt awkward and uncomfortable , wondering what she should do or say ."
"instead of worrying about it though , she simply spoke out , uttering the question that was utmost on her mind ."
"`` did you ... ."
"? ''"
"she could n't finish the sentence because he was roaring with laughter ."
"he buried his face in her neck and shook his head ."
"`` ah , dana , my sweet ."
"i 'm afraid that the only reason you need to ask that question is because i 'm about to create a bit of pain for you ."
"if i could stop it from happening , i would , but i ca n't hold back any longer , '' he said and gently his hand moved down her leg , lifting her knee ."
"dana 's chest ached with tenderness for this man who was being so generous and gentle ."
"`` i 'll be okay , '' she said with determination and gripped his shoulders once again ."
"he chuckled again and bent to nibble on her ear ."
"`` you 'll be more than okay , '' he replied and moved down to her shoulder , sending more shivers along her body ."
"his hands smoothed down her waist , then up again to cup her breasts ."
"`` do you have any idea of how beautiful you are right at this moment ? ''"
"he asked and his thumb flicked against her nipple ."
"dana could n't reply as her body , which had been sated only moments ago , came roaring back to life with his touch ."
"the man knew exactly how to touch her , where to move and how to get her body back in the swing of the moment ."
"`` hassan ? ''"
"she asked and opened her eyes , biting her lower lip to try and control her trembling ."
"`` i do n't ' think i can ... '' `` you can , '' he countered and lifted her hips ."
"as his body slowly entered hers , he watched her eyes , moving in slightly , then out ."
"back in again just a bit deeper , measuring how deep to go with each thrust by her face and the way her body moved against his ."
"sweat broke out on his forehead as he grasped at his control , something he 'd never had a problem doing before this slender woman underneath him ."
"he wanted this to be perfect for her , but she was so hot , so tight and so wet , he could barely stop himself from slamming into her warmth , burying himself to the hilt and finding his release ."
"when he heard her gasp of surprise , he knew he 'd finally gotten her almost back to where she 'd been before ."
"just a little bit more , he thought ."
"and then he felt the resistance and his suspicions proved accurate ."
"he gathered her close and put his forehead against hers ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he said a moment before he pushed through the barrier of her virginity , catching her gasp of pain in his mouth and kissing her , moving against her to soothe the pain as best he could ."
"when he felt her legs move higher , taking him deeper , he knew he 'd won this battle ."
"this slender , incredibly passionate woman was now his and he intended to show her exactly what that gift meant to him ."
"with incredible slowness , he moved against her , increasing the pressure as she moved , using her cries of delight to gauge when to go faster or move in a different way ."
"she was so free with her passion that he almost lost control several times but it was all worth it when he felt her body arch against his , felt her muscles clench around his erection as she tumbled over the edge ."
"only then did he allow himself the freedom his body was demanding , pounding against her , holding her hips where he needed them until he found his own incredible release ."
"a long time later , he felt her fingers in his hair , smoothing down his back and shoulders and he shuddered with the intense pleasure he got from her touch ."
"`` you 're alive ? ''"
"she asked and he moved to her side , taking her with him and enjoying her teasing ."
"`` i could say the same for you , '' he countered and pulled her leg so that she was still against him , feeling her softness and enjoying her touch ."
"she lifted her head and looked around ."
"`` where are we ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he laughed slightly ."
"`` in my bed . ''"
"she took it all in , the dark colors and the luxurious appointments ."
"`` i should have guessed . ''"
"`` do n't even try to convince me that you 're used to trying to figure out where you are after the fact ."
"first of all , i know better and have proof that it would be a lie ."
"secondly , the blush that 's covering your very lovely cheeks is giving me a whole different story . ''"
"she pressed her face against his chest and sighed ."
"`` no ."
"i ca n't even go down that road ."
"i 've never found myself in any other sheik 's bed before , i can guarantee that . ''"
"he swatted her bottom and she shrieked , a moment before she laughed and tried to move out of his range ."
"`` okay , so i have n't found myself in anyone 's bed before ."
"sue me . ''"
"`` how in the world could someone as gorgeous as you are be a virgin at the age of twenty-five ? ''"
"she shrugged and kissed the middle of his chest , loving the taste of his skin , just a little bit salty , musky and oh , so male ."
"`` i mentioned yesterday that my parents died when i was in college ."
"by the time i 'd recovered from the grief of losing both of them , i was almost graduating ."
"and i had to focus on studying instead of the male species in order catch up and graduate with my class . ''"
"he suspected there was more to the story , but sensed it was a painful subject ."
"one he would eventually get to , but her hands on his chest , fluttering about , were driving him a bit crazy ."
"`` i think there 's a bit of catching up to do right here , '' he said and nibbled on her shoulder ."
"`` you do ? ''"
"she asked and let her fingers move across his back , loving the muscles that shifted under her hands ."
"`` absolutely , '' he replied ."
"`` do n't lose your focus . ''"
"`` i wo n't , '' she sighed happily as he kissed her neck , moving down her body and setting her nerve endings on fire ."
"chapter 4 dana woke up feeling sore and more exhausted that she 'd felt for a long , long time ."
"glancing around , she could n't see the clock on the side of her bed , and then realized she was n't in her bed ."
"this one had softer sheets , almost like satin and it was enormous ."
"then the night slowly came back to her ."
"the passion and crazy need for hassan , that even now came roaring back to life ."
"he 'd made love to her until she could n't think any longer , was begging him for release ."
"and after he gave it to her , he 'd give her a few minutes to recover before he started it all over again ."
"the man had the stamina of an ox , she thought ."
"as much as she wanted to snuggle up against him , press her back more closely to his strong chest , she knew it would be better if she left ."
"not just his bed , but the whole palace ."
"this had been a wonderful , amazing interlude , but it had to end ."
"tonight ."
"with a sigh , she looked up at the ceiling and thought about the small things she needed to pack before heading out of the country ."
"she could just pack up her car with clothes and water , the little bit of food she still had in her refrigerator and a few blankets ."
"that should get her through the night at least , and she could find a place to sleep when she became too exhausted to drive any longer ."
"it was probably better to leave in the middle of the night for her next destination ."
"first of all , she suspected that the men following her would n't expect her to be courageous enough to travel at night , preferring the security of daylight so she could make a better get away ."
"and secondly , she did n't have any direction , so she could more effectively get out of town , then retrace her direction to make sure she was n't being followed ."
"it was easier to see if someone was following you at night because of the lack of traffic ."
"of course , if she got out into the desert and someone was following her , she would be in a worse position because there would n't be anyone around to help her ."
"but it was worth the risk , she decided ."
"carefully , she lifted his hand off her waist and slid to the edge of the bed ."
"she had trouble finding her clothes in the darkness but eventually , she was able to gather most of them up and scurry to the bathroom ."
"she wanted to just slip out , but she was desperate for a shower so she jumped into the stunning black marble shower and soaped up as quickly as she could ."
"drying off , she buried her face in the soft , scented towels , wishing she could just let out her sorrow about leaving him and have a good , long cry ."
"or maybe call jenna or sasha ."
"they would know exactly what to say to her and how to get her to laugh despite her misery over the last twelve hours ."
"unfortunately , now was not the time , she reprimanded herself ."
"get out of this mess , then figure out her next step ."
"and avoid hassan at all times since he seemed intent on keeping her here in the palace ."
"she forced her fingers to work the buttons on her clothes and , even though she looked like a mess with no makeup on and her hair all over the place , she turned off the light and slipped out of the bathroom ."
"she quietly made her way out of his private suite and back to her office , praying no one else in the palace saw her ."
"dana thought she saw a couple of men in one of the hallways , but assumed they were just the palace guards doing their normal rounds ."
"but after her experience in the marketplace , she did n't want to risk it and the whole way down the hallway to her office she was jumping at every movement and each shadow , even if it did n't move ."
"in her office , she grabbed her keys and purse and quickly made her way out the employee entrance , smiling stiffly to the guards on duty ."
"she did n't recognize these men , never having been here in this hallway at this time of the night ."
"but they all looked extremely competent and she was glad for their presence as she made her way to her car ."
"there were very few left in the employee lot and she felt extremely conspicuous leaving like this ."
"the streets were dark and vacant , only a few cars behind her as she drove back to her apartment ."
"as she drove , she tried to be aware of what was happening around her , glancing in her rear view mirror to make sure she was n't being followed ."
"she felt a bit silly when she tried to spy cars behind her with their headlights off , just like in the television shows she 'd watched , but she did n't care ."
"better safe than sorry , she told herself ."
"she was working through all the details of how she was going to get away while still scanning the area , looking for odd places people might hide ."
"so when the taxi cab came from the left and she was looking to the right down a dark street , she was n't as prepared as she should have been ."
"she was still able to avoid a major collision because she 'd been hyper aware , but her car was still hit , if only on the front bumper ."
"the cab driver immediately got out of his car and started apologizing and dana breathed a sigh of relief that it was truly an accident and not those guys out to get her as she left her work site ."
"she almost chuckled to herself that she 'd thought someone would have waited outside the palace at this time of the night just to get her ."
"in the distance , she heard sirens indicating that the police had already been notified and was surprised that they were on the way ."
"she never got this kind of service back home !"
"the cab driver looked behind him , obviously worried that the police were here so quickly ."
"his eyes frantically scanning the side streets as if waiting for someone to appear out of the darkness ."
"dana was searching through her purse , trying to find her identification when the police officer pulled up , his car angled directly to the side of hers while another one pulled up behind the cab driver ."
"she was just about to pull her wallet out when the police officer approached her ."
"`` everything is okay , ma'am ."
"please just go on back to your car , '' he said politely ."
"the officer approaching the cab driver did n't appear to be as polite and dana wanted to argue that it had only been an accident ."
"`` oh , but do n't you need ... . ''"
"she started to say but the officer was already shaking his head , putting his body in front of her and looking around quickly ."
"it was almost like he was protecting her from the cab driver , but that seemed ridiculous ."
"of course it was the cab driver 's fault , but that did n't seem like a good enough reason to arrest the poor guy ."
"`` no need , '' the police officer said , his arms spread wide as he moved in front of her , blocking her view of the cab driver ."
"`` we 'll take care of this . ''"
"dana heard another accident a couple of blocks away but the officers near her did n't appear surprised or even concerned about the accident ."
"two car accidents so close together ?"
"and at this time of night ?"
"she glanced over at the cab driver and a funny feeling invaded her mind ."
"something was definitely wrong here ."
"`` you 're free to go ."
"you must return to the palace , '' the officer said ."
"he nodded to the other officer who approached the cab driver ."
"a moment later , the officer was handcuffing the man and putting him into the back seat of the police car and oddly , the cab driver was accepting this as normal ."
"no , something definitely was n't right ."
"the officer bowed with deference and gestured for her to get back into her car ."
"he was painfully polite as he said , `` please , ms. miller ."
"you must return to the palace ."
"sheik faiser-al-takar himself is waiting for you at the entrance ."
"he will explain . ''"
"`` hassan is waiting for me ? ''"
"she asked , her head spinning with the events unfolding around her ."
"the thought of hassan knowing already that she was gone was a huge problem ."
"but when he found out that she 'd been in an accident , he was going to be completely livid !"
"no , it was better if she just continued on her way as if nothing had happened ."
"she 'd figure out how to deal with the legal issues of this accident later on ."
"as it was , she was already delayed from her goal of getting out of town since this whole scene had taken up more time than she had tonight ."
"she had been hoping to be over the border before he woke up this morning ."
"`` please ma'am ."
"you must move quickly . ''"
"she really did n't want to go back to the palace but she was n't sure she was going to be given a choice ."
"the police officer seemed intent on getting her back to safety and , in his mind , the palace was her only destination ."
"dana put a hand to the roof of her car and considered how she was going to explain her absence to hassan ."
"she knew he would n't be pleased and if the roles had been reversed , she would be pretty hurt if she 'd woken up after having sex with someone only to find they had spirited off in the middle of the night ."
"well , this was n't her fault , she thought with more than a touch of defensiveness ."
"in fact , the whole reason she was here this late , or early depending on one 's perspective , was because he 'd been adamant that she not leave the palace grounds ."
"it was his fault that she was out here in the dead of night and had gotten into an accident ."
"he had no right to be unhappy about this turn of events , she told herself in an effort to try and wiggle out of his upcoming tirade ."
"okay , so it was n't that he was n't going to be happy ."
"he was going to be downright furious with her ."
"with shaking fingers , she put her car in gear and drove slowly back to the palace ."
"it was only a few miles , but the sight of headlights behind her made her nervous ."
"what if someone had followed her the other day ?"
"if they knew she worked at the palace and ... ."
"she did n't have time to figure that out ."
"she had to focus all of her attention on getting through this interview with hassan ."
"the guards would n't let anyone inside the walls without authorization and she had bigger things to worry about at the moment ."
"she had to find a way to convince him that she could n't stay here , that it was better if they just acted as if last night were a casual event and she should be on her way ."
"but last night had n't been casual for her ."
"it had been the most magical night of her life ."
"she wanted him again even now as she parked her car but knew that she had to be strong ."
"she had to make sure he was protected ."
"those men would n't care if he were a ruler , would n't care if she might be his mistress ."
"they had a job to do and that was to protect their boss from prosecution ."
"their businesses , albeit illegal enterprises , were international and any disruption to their supply would cause a ripple effect that could equate to a major tsunami when it was finally over ."
"no , not even hassan had the power to protect her in this situation ."
"as she entered the palace , she looked around and the same guards who had watched her leave , were looking at her curiously now ."
"then she saw him ."
"the man standing at the end of the hallway was a mass of barely contained fury ."
"he might look calm and controlled , the epitome of the mighty ruler of all he surveyed but she could tell the difference in the way his feet were braced a bit farther apart than normal and how his shoulders were tense , his whole body still while his eyes watched her walk down the hallway ."
"she approached cautiously , worried about what to say to ease the anger within in him ."
"`` where the hell did you think you were going ? ''"
"he demanded , glaring down at her with his arms crossed over his chest ."
"she was n't fooled by the low tone of voice ."
"this man was seething ."
"`` i was going home ."
"that 's my usual plan at the end of each day . ''"
"he took a step closer , their toes almost touching ."
"`` i do n't think either one of us could classify this as a normal end of the day ."
"and i dare you to tell me otherwise ."
"i dare you to even try and convince yourself of that , dana . ''"
"`` hassan ... '' his hand sliced up into the air , cutting off her explanation ."
"there was nothing she could say that would justify her actions tonight ."
"he would n't admit that he was also furious that she 'd left him after such an a amazing interlude , one of the best of his life ."
"perhaps it had n't meant as much to her , which only made him angrier ."
"`` do n't patronize me , dana ."
"you put yourself in danger and i will not permit that . ''"
"she realized that approach was n't going to fly so she tried a different angle ."
"`` i 'm not completely sure why you 're so furious with me ."
"it was n't as if ... '' `` do n't finish that sentence , '' he ordered and was almost shouting ."
"`` as i said , you put yourself in danger ."
"when we started this several hours ago , i told you that i would n't permit you to leave the palace unless you could take me down with your fighting skills ."
"since you were unable to do that , you went against a direct order . ''"
"her mouth fell open with that outrageous statement ."
"`` that 's not really fair ! ''"
"he was making it sound like she 'd committed treason by walking out on him ."
"he leaned down so she would n't be mistaken in his declaration ."
"`` i do n't deal in fair or unfair ."
"i gave you an order and i expect it to be obeyed . ''"
"she stiffened at his order , wanting to fight back but not sure exactly how to do that ."
"`` i 'm not your ... '' `` do n't even try to put a definition on what you are to me , '' he said , cutting off her argument ."
"`` i 'm too furious with you for what you did tonight to listen to you try and belittle our evening . ''"
"since she 'd been about to do just that , she shut her mouth and glared right back at him ."
"`` wise choice , '' he said with a nod ."
"`` now explain to me why you found it imperative to leave in the middle of the night . ''"
"`` i had to get back to my apartment . ''"
"he raised an eyebrow when she said that and stopped , as if that meant something more than just running an errand ."
"`` and it was okay to not only put yourself in danger , but those of your security detail ? ''"
"she blinked , not sure what he meant by that statement ."
"`` i do n't have a security detail ! ''"
"`` you do as of two days ago ."
"and this little incident tonight proves that i was right in getting that in place . ''"
"she gasped and leaned back , her hands fisting at her sides ."
"`` you had me followed ? ''"
"he bent down lower , his finger poking her in the shoulder to emphasize his point ."
"`` i had you protected !"
"there 's a significant difference . ''"
"`` not in my mind . ''"
"`` what would you call tonight ? ''"
"she threw her hands up in the air , waving them as if he was being obtuse about the events of the past hour ."
"`` it was an innocent accident ."
"that cab driver did n't mean to run into me ."
"he was just tired . ''"
"hassan glanced behind him , saw the shake of the guards head and stared at her ."
"`` it was n't an accident , dana . ''"
"he spoke the words carefully , wanting her to understand exactly what was happening ."
"`` of course it was . ''"
"he lowered his voice and she saw a great deal of the anger leave his body ."
"it was still there , just tempered by her innocence of how this violent world works ."
"he gently shook his head , letting her down easy ."
"`` it was n't just an accident ."
"it was a carefully orchestrated plan to get you out of the car so you were vulnerable . ''"
"she stopped talking at that point ."
"was that true ?"
"had someone deliberately set a trap for her ?"
"`` why would someone ... '' she shook her head , denying what he 'd said ."
"`` no way ."
"the people ... .i mean , why would anyone ... . ''"
"she stopped again , shutting her mouth for fear that she might reveal something she should n't ."
"`` why would someone want to kill you ? ''"
"he finished for her ."
"`` maybe to get you out of the way ."
"it could be because you already have too much influence over me ."
"or maybe it was the same people who tried to grab you in the marketplace two days ago ."
"whatever the reason , you will be staying inside the palace until this is figured out ."
"and after this is over , you will still be protected ."
"do you understand ? ''"
"he explained firmly , not allowing her any room to argue about his precautions ."
"`` you 're being ridiculous ! ''"
"she snapped right back , scared that she 'd been so naive and embarrassed that she probably had put other men in danger ."
"she did n't like thinking she was self-centered , but that was exactly what she 'd done tonight and she was having trouble coping ."
"he smiled at her argument , but there was n't any amusement in the look ."
"`` that 's my right , my love ."
"i can be as arbitrary as i want and there 's nothing you can do about it . ''"
"he said the words and knew he was digging himself in deeper , but he could n't help it ."
"the idea of her being in danger made him sick with fury ."
"he could n't let anything harm her now ."
"she was his and he protected what was his , even if they fought that protection ."
"her mind whirled about his words , frantically trying to make sense of everything that was happening ."
"but there were too many questions and definitely not enough answers ."
"besides the fact that she was exhausted since she 'd basically been up most of the night ."
"`` i need to go home and get some sleep , '' she said wearily ."
"he moved closer , his eyes angrily glaring at her ."
"`` you were asleep ."
"why did you leave ? ''"
"she held her breath , realizing that he was n't just furious about her being in danger ."
"she 'd left him and she 'd known he 'd be upset about that ."
"just as she would be if she were in his position ."
"`` look hassan , about that ... '' she started to say but he interrupted her ."
"`` we will not discuss this now ."
"you 're tired and need some sleep ."
"go back to my suite and get some rest ."
"when you wake up , we 'll talk . ''"
"she was already shaking her head by the time he finished , looking around to see if anyone had heard him , horrified at the idea of the other palace employees knowing that she 'd slept with the sheik ."
"`` i ca n't sleep there ! ''"
"she whispered , her head bent and her eyes glancing to the right and left ."
"he had to control his anger at her reply ."
"he counted to three before he responded but even then it came out as almost a shout ."
"`` why the hell not ? ''"
"she grimaced at his loud voice but tried to get him to understand ."
"`` because , people will start to gossip !"
"they 'll think something is going on between us . ''"
"`` there is something going on between us ! ''"
"he put his hands on his hips , wondering if she was really so naive to think that their interlude last night had gone unnoticed ."
"not only were his personal body guards aware of her whereabouts , but he 'd also assigned a team to her , and they 'd been outside his door the whole time ."
"not to mention the police force who had to be brought in because of the accident and the investigation , the arrests of the men who had been sent to kill her and all the support staff for those issues ."
"there were so many people who were in the loop about this that it was ridiculous to consider that the whole palace would n't know by tomorrow afternoon ."
"or today , he corrected as he glanced at his watch ."
"`` fine , '' he snapped , allowing her the fantasy of thinking she 'd escaped notice ."
"he waved over one of her guards who had been standing behind her at attention and pretending they were n't hearing everything that had been said ."
"`` bring ms. miller to the suite next to mine and let her sleep ."
"make sure no one disturbs her . ''"
"hassan had lived in the palace his whole life so he knew that the guards were fully aware of all conversations ."
"and most of the time , they needed to know in order to understand what kinds of issues they might face ."
"in this case , he did n't really want to wound her pride , so he went along with the pretence that the guards been far enough away to not have overheard ."
"dana was having none of that ."
"`` not the one next to yours ! ''"
"she hissed ."
"`` everyone will still wonder why i 'm sleeping so close to you ."
"i 've already been in there one night ."
"two nights will really be fodder for the palace gossip . ''"
"hassan rolled his eyes and turned away ."
"`` the farthest suite from mine , '' he replied and turned away , walking towards his office and trying very hard to ignore the woman who was driving him crazy ."
"if he were in his right mind , he would simply toss her over his shoulder and carry her back to his own bed ."
"but he knew he would n't get any sleep if that happened ."
"nor would she , he thought and turned the corner to head towards his office ."
"`` where are you going ? ''"
"she called out to him ."
"`` i 'll be in my office ."
"go to sleep , '' he replied and turned out of her sight ."
"dana stared at his back , worried that he was n't getting any sleep either ."
"she 'd done this to him , she thought ."
"if she 'd been smart about this whole thing , she never would have gotten involved with him ."
"but he 'd goaded her in the gym ."
"and then he 'd done ... .goodness what he 'd done to her !"
"she shivered and took a deep breath to get herself back under control ."
"facing the large , bulky man standing silently beside her , she smiled and said , `` okay , where 's the farthest bedroom from the sheik 's where i can freshen up a bit ? ''"
"he bowed and led her down a long hallway ."
"he pushed open an ornate door that led to a lovely room filled with gauzy fabrics and long sofas ."
"`` this is really nice , '' she sighed and smiled up at him ."
"`` i 'll just freshen up and head into has ... i mean , the sheik 's office to help him with whatever he 's working on . ''"
"the man bowed and retreated as he closed the door and dana was uncomfortable with the idea that he was probably standing outside her doorway waiting for her ."
"she was n't sure if he would be keeping her safe , or making sure no one else got into the room ."
"or ensuring that she did n't leave the palace again ."
"probably all of the above , she thought with resignation ."
"what would the guard do if hassan tried to enter the room , she wondered ."
"dana was pretty sure the guard would n't stop the ruler of his country ."
"she went to the bathroom and found several toiletries and took another shower , this one longer and more thorough in an effort to revive her muddled mind ."
"there was a hair dryer and some makeup , but much better brands than what she was used to ."
"most of the colors would work for her , but she experimented with some others ."
"she used extra foundation to hide the dark circles under her eyes and applied several coats of mascara to help her eyes appear more awake and alert ."
"lipstick and powder finished it off and she smoothed down her wrinkled blouse and slacks ."
"they 'd been on hassan 's floor for a bit too long to look professional any longer ."
"nothing a good dry cleaning could n't fix , she told herself and splashed water on her wrists to revive her a bit more ."
"she was back in her office twenty minutes later , but did n't disturb hassan who was already writing notes on some contract or document ."
"he looked very intent , and not tired at all ."
"how he managed that , she 'd like to know as she wilted into her chair ."
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"he asked a half hour later ."
"dana jumped and spun around to face him ."
"`` i 've finished these documents and they 're ready for your approval ."
"your speech for the conference this afternoon is on the top in case you 'd like to make any changes . ''"
"he took the papers and set them down on her desk ."
"`` i told you to get some sleep ."
"not get in here earlier than normal , dana . ''"
"`` i heard you , '' she replied and turned to her computer ."
"`` so why are you here at your desk instead of in bed sound asleep ? ''"
"she turned worried eyes up to his face and smiled gently ."
"`` you got just as much sleep as i did last night , '' she whispered , glancing around since others were starting to arrive for work and she did n't want them to hear ."
"`` if you can be here in the office , so can i. i want to help and you need some rest so if you 'll go to sleep , so will i . ''"
"he sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose ."
"`` but i gave you a direct order to get some sleep . ''"
"she looked up at him and smiled brightly ."
"`` like i said , i will if you will . ''"
"he leaned forward and braced his hands on her desk ."
"`` is that an invitation ? ''"
"she pushed back , shaking her head emphatically even as her body reacted in a completely different way ."
"`` certainly not !"
"i do n't like ornery men who like giving orders . ''"
"she was lying ."
"all she wanted to do was throw herself into his arms and feel those muscles close in around her , making her feel all soft and feminine ."
"she loved the way he touched her and ... .stop it , she told herself ."
"time to concentrate on work and not on making love with this very amazing man ."
"he smiled sensuously , his eyes straying down from her face to her breasts , watching as they reacted to his visual touch ."
"`` you liked me fine last night ."
"shall i repeat some of your comments ? ''"
"she put a hand over his mouth in case he wanted to proceed ."
"`` that was different . ''"
"he pulled her hand away and smiled wolfishly down at her ."
"`` how so ? ''"
"gone were all those gentle feelings she 'd had towards this man a few moments ago ."
"now she was just irritated that he was being inappropriate in the office environment ."
"it did n't matter that her own mind had already gone down that road ."
"she 'd stopped it and he needed to do the same !"
"`` that was before i knew what an arrogant , domineering jerk you can be when you order me around ! ''"
"`` i 'm keeping you safe , '' he countered , not offended at all about her words ."
"she was touching him , and he liked it even if she was being treasonous by covering his mouth or punching him in the arm ."
"hell , he even liked the way she did n't obey him , but he was n't going to tell her that ."
"with all the people who bowed and scraped to him , it was nice to have someone speak openly ."
"it was probably because he wanted her so badly that he put up with her kind of insolence ."
"`` you 're going to sleep . ''"
"`` i will as soon as i get these notes transcribed for your lunch meeting , '' she said and walked out of her office , leaving him still leaning against her desk ."
"he stood up and watched her leave , his hands burning to grab her and ... well , he had lots of things he wanted to do ."
"a good spanking was at the top of his list at the moment ."
"and then he 'd rub the redness away , soothing the skin and kissing it until she purred just like she had last night ."
"it occurred to him that she might be thinking that last night was a one time deal ."
"if she was worried about others in the palace gossiping , he 'd have to be a bit more subtle , but he was damned if he was going to give her up ."
"no way , he thought and grabbed the papers she 'd handed to him and stormed off to his next meeting ."
"by four o'clock that afternoon , dana was almost in tears with fatigue ."
"but she was determined to continue on if hassan was still going strong ."
"she was n't going to be weaker than he was and she wanted to help him through his day as much as she could ."
"besides , she needed to give him her resignation and she had n't had a chance to do that yet ."
"he 'd been so busy that he 'd been rushing around from one meeting to another , or his advisors would show up and want to discuss one issue or another ."
"the poor man really had a tough life , she thought as she pulled out yet another submission for assistance ."
"a sandwich had appeared at her elbow at some point during the day , but she 'd been to tired to finish it ."
"when she almost knocked it off her desk , she gave in and dumped it into the trash can ."
"it was dinner time now and hassan had gone to yet another endless meeting so dana gave in and shut down for the day ."
"she was so tired she actually ached ."
"she thought about going to the kitchen for something to eat , but she discarded the idea in favor of just crawling into bed and sleeping for the next twelve hours ."
"glancing at her watch , she noted that even if she were to get into bed now , she still would n't have twelve hours before she needed to be back at her desk ."
"in the suite she 'd been given the night before , she smiled to the guard who stood outside the door before closing it ."
"she showered and dried her hair , then slipped between the sheets in the large , comfy robe she 'd found in the bathroom ."
"she still did n't have her night clothes so she did n't have an alternative ."
"good grief , she thought before she slipped off to sleep ."
"she did n't even have anything different to wear tomorrow !"
"later that night , hassan looked down at the woman lying amid the sheets ."
"she looked so achingly beautiful with her hair spread out against the satin pillow that he was hard pressed not to strip off his clothes and climb in beside her ."
"the only thing that stopped him was the dark circles under her eyes that he could see even in the dim light ."
"she needed a good night 's sleep and she definitely would n't get it if he slept with her ."
"there would be very little sleeping , he thought as his body hardened while he looked down at her breast that was only barely covered with the fluffy , white robe ."
"he could still see the gentle curve and he wanted very much to pull the material away and taste her breast , to feel her softness and taste the nipple , feeling it peak in his mouth as she moaned with pleasure ."
"instead , he turned around and walked out of the room ."
"`` make sure she 's safe , '' he ordered the two guards standing at attention outside her room ."
"both men saluted him an instant before he turned and headed back to his private suite ."
"it would still be a long night , but at least he knew where she was and that she would n't be kidnapped or shot at ."
"chapter 5 dana shuffled the papers around , filed several away and pulled more out which hassan would need later in the day ."
"she slapped them onto her desk and glared at the tower of paperwork still waiting for her attention ."
"she told herself she was n't disappointed that hassan had n't come to her bed last night ."
"she 'd gotten a good night 's sleep , one of the guards had even brought her a new suit to wear , a sophisticated black number with lots of pretty buttons up the middle ."
"thankfully , the suit had come with a sexy pair of black pumps , which made her feel oh so sophisticated !"
"she might feel better physically , but for some reason , she was not a happy camper today ."
"and she could n't quite figure out why she was so snippy ."
"`` i 'm here to see hassan , '' a sexy , female voice announced from her doorway ."
"dana looked up from her files and noticed the gorgeous woman standing in front of her desk ."
"her long , black hair was smooth and silky , curling just slightly at the ends ."
"her eyes were almost black but the eye liner that edged each eye made her look sultry and very chic ."
"dana hated the woman on site and wished she had a brighter outfit like this woman 's ."
"the creamy yellow sundress was perfectly cut to enhance this woman 's curves , low cut in the front in order to show just the right amount of cleavage to be alluring without being slutty ."
"`` i do n't have an appointment , but he 'll see me , '' she replied , laughing softly ."
"in her wildest dreams , dana could n't pull of a laugh as sexy and sophisticated as that and she clenched her teeth in frustration ."
"`` his highness has a very busy schedule today , '' she said , trying very hard to be polite , but it was difficult since all she wanted to do was reach across the desk and scratch the other woman 's eyes out ."
"instinctively , dana knew that this woman with her cloying perfume and perfectly styled hair , sophisticated makeup and all the mannerisms of a supremely confident woman , was `` the competition '' ."
"not that she wanted hassan , she reminded herself ."
"she did n't like him ."
"at least not at the moment ."
"and then a thought occurred to her that made her feel as if she 'd been punched in the gut ."
"was this woman the reason hassan had n't come to visit her last night ?"
"had he been wrapped in her long arms and sexy legs ?"
"had he done to this woman all the wonderful , magical things he 'd done to dana the previous night ?"
"dana had to concentrate on breathing , her anger so overwhelming as she pictured her handsome hassan and this woman doing what she and he had shared together ."
"there was an instant hatred that she had trouble suppressing ."
"`` just tell him farida is here ."
"he 'll come running ."
"just wait , '' the woman said and winked ."
"dana picked up the phone and transferred the information that farida was here to see him ."
"`` i 'll be right out , '' hassan replied and hung up the phone ."
"dana wanted to lash out at him but controlled herself ."
"`` he 's on his way , '' she replied with a forced smile ."
"farida grinned right back ."
"`` i told you so !"
"i love it when my fiance is so prompt and attentive ."
"do n't you ? ''"
"she did n't wait for a response but turned on her perfectly shod foot and walked out of dana 's office in hassan 's direction ."
"dana saw him meet her halfway but had to look away when farida lifted her face in anticipation of hassan 's kiss ."
"dana could n't endure the scene and busied herself with the files that had been piling up on her desk ."
"dana glanced at his schedule and was furious that he was throwing it all off for a woman like that ."
"he had to know that his meeting with the minister of defense had been on the schedule for weeks !"
"of course , if he was going to throw off his day , it might as well be with someone like farida ."
"she was perfect ; sexy , sophisticated , probably wealthy and knew how to go about in his world ."
"why would he want to be with someone like dana ?"
"she played hot and cold , afraid to let anyone know that she 'd actually been with him ."
"farida was n't embarrassed ."
"good grief , she practically announced it to anyone who would listen ."
"and even those who did n't want to listen !"
"at six o'clock , hassan still had n't returned and dana was too furious to work any longer ."
"she 'd done enough for the man , she thought and shut down her computer with more force than was necessary ."
"ignoring the stack of files that needed to be worked as well as all the transcription and little details that had piled up because dana had been too distracted this afternoon to be efficient , she closed her laptop and pressed the button on her phone that would send her calls to the palace operator ."
"she was walking down the hallway , trying desperately hard to get her emotions under control but had no way of doing that ."
"her two body guards were walking behind her which meant she could n't go home since they 'd probably stop her ."
"or would they ?"
"she turned around and opened her mouth to ask , but the taller one just said , `` no , '' shaking his head to emphasize his point ."
"she grimaced and looked back at him ."
"`` you do n't even know what i was going to ask , '' she said , her hands fisted by her side ."
"he shrugged his massive shoulders ."
"`` you were going to ask if you could go back to your apartment , '' he replied as if his assumption was the most obvious thing in the world ."
"since that had been exactly what she was going to ask , there was no response she could offer so she closed her mouth and turned around , heading back to the suite she 'd slept in last night ."
"she could n't help but nod her appreciation to the guards , who nodded politely back as they walked into her rooms and looked through all the closets , behind the doors and curtains and in all the nooks and crannies possible , then took their sentry positions outside her door ."
"she was a bit exasperated with their thoroughness , but did n't begrudge them taking their responsibilities so deeply ."
"they were dedicated to keeping hassan alive , and apparently she now fell under that category ."
"she did n't mind actually ."
"she had n't slept so well in over a year ."
"she had n't realized how lightly she 'd been sleeping but knowing she was inside the palace walls along with two men outside her door , she had rested deeply and thoroughly ."
"in her apartment , she woke to any kind of creak or groan , her mind sifting through the sound until it was categorized and classified as non-threatening ."
"she had n't even realized she 'd been doing that until she did n't have to while sleeping here where everything was silent and she had people outside her door protecting her ."
"that did n't mean she liked being confined ."
"she paced back and forth in her room , not sure what to do with herself ."
"she could watch television , but she hated that pastime , thinking it sucked up a person 's life so she avoided it as much as possible ."
"she could put in a movie , knowing that there was a whole series of movies available to stream from any television or computer for hassan and any guest in the palace ."
"but she did n't think she could sit still to watch a movie ."
"she was feeling restless and irritable , and not sure why ."
"she needed an outlet for her nervous energy ."
"she could n't exercise because she was afraid she 'd run into hassan and he was the very last person she wanted to talk to right now ."
"it would be better if she confronted him once she 'd calmed down a bit ."
"of course , she would n't really confront him ."
"she had absolutely no claim on the man , except for their one night together ."
"which probably did n't count in his mind ."
"he probably had one night stands with a number of women ."
"dana knew there were some types who threw themselves at available , wealthy , powerful and handsome men like hassan ."
"she snorted in the silence of the suite as she realized that she 'd probably throw herself at hassan after describing him in that manner ."
"which actually hurt even more ."
"she hated the idea of hassan being in the arms of another woman when she wanted him so much ."
"but she disliked the idea that she was one of many ."
"knowing he enjoyed the company of other women made their night together seem sordid and tawdry ."
"cooking , she thought ."
"yes , that was her outlet ."
"her reliable relaxation for anything that was bothering her ."
"it had gotten her through worse times than this , she thought ."
"she did n't have any other clothes and as amazing as these shoes were , they were higher than she was used to and the marble hallways of the palace made walking on the balls of her feet ache ."
"she flipped the shoes off and padded to the closet , hoping she might find a pair of sneakers or slippers left behind by someone ."
"no such luck , she realized ."
"there was another suit in the closet , this one in a lovely shade of brown ."
"and another matching pair of shoes , but no slippers ."
"`` i do n't care , '' she whispered and carefully hung the suit jacket up on a hanger , then pulled her slacks up and marched out of her suite ."
"the two men were surprised to see her but she did n't even pause as she walked out of the double door of her suite ."
"`` i 'm going to the kitchen if that 's okay with you boys ? ''"
"she waited for their reply , but they both just stood there looking at her ."
"she assumed they were n't used to their charges asking permission and shrugged their confusion away ."
"heading towards the kitchen , she thought about all the things she wanted to cook , considering and discarding several recipes ."
"in the kitchen , she approached the same young woman who had helped her before ."
"`` i 'm sorry to bother your processes again , but would anyone mind if i just whipped up a couple of things ? ''"
"the woman was confused ."
"`` we will be happy to prepare anything you 'd like , ma'am , '' she said nervously , glancing behind dana at the two body guards that were hovering ."
"`` no , i just need to work through some nervous energy and cooking helps me ."
"but if i 'm going to be in the way ... '' the woman immediately shook her head , not wanting to insult a personal guest of the sheik ."
"`` help yourself ."
"let me know what you need and i 'll bring it to you . ''"
"she quickly stepped back and bowed slightly , glancing over dana 's shoulder to the guards to make sure dana was n't offended in any way ."
"`` no , no , '' dana countered with excitement and waved happily to the woman ."
"`` i can do it all by myself ."
"i do n't want to interrupt anything you guys are already working on preparing . ''"
"she went to the pantry and surveyed the various ingredients , then to the giant refrigerator and freezer , doing the same thing ."
"she decided on making a cake first of all , thinking the mixing and beating would get out some of her energy ."
"a multi-layered cake with thick frosting and some gooey filling to make it even sweeter ."
"maybe even decorations so that she 'd have to concentrate and not think about men with sexy eyes and broad shoulders ."
"an hour later , she had two cake layers cooling on the racks behind her and she was pounding out chicken breasts ."
"six of them , actually ."
"four of them were already pounded out and were breaded , in the refrigerator chilling before she put them into the oven ."
"she knew she was cooking too much , but it was therapeutic and she knew it would n't go to waste ."
"her new body guards would help her eat it , if no one else were interested ."
"she definitely would n't offer any of her food to that irritating man who was probably now cavorting ... dammit !"
"she pounded the chicken breast harder , wanting to get rid of the image of hassan and the bitchingly beautiful farida ."
"she was frantically chopping up ingredients for a salad when she noticed a hush fall over the kitchen staff ."
"dana did n't even glance up , knowing that hassan had entered their domain and irritated that everyone acted so deferential to the man ."
"who cared if he was their ruler ?"
"he was a jerk !"
"he was a rude , insensitive , horrible man who thought that women were throw away pieces that he could keep around and take out to play with when he was bored ."
"she did n't even think about the way she 'd snuck out of the palace two nights ago ."
"that was different , she told herself as she grabbed a tomato and slaughtered it with the knife ."
"she reminded herself that she had no business asking him about farida ."
"dana told herself that she was his only employee , that was all , and she chopped the carrots more quickly , tossing them into the bowl beside her ."
"`` what are you up to ? ''"
"he asked and swiped a carrot from her bowl ."
"she stopped chopping and glared up at him , not saying a word ."
"just waiting for him to look around and answer the question himself ."
"hassan chuckled and smiled , unrepentant for asking an obvious question ."
"`` okay , why are you doing it ? ''"
"she shook her head and resumed chopping , ignoring him as much as a woman could ignore a six foot three inch man with huge muscles and a desire not to be ignored ."
"`` if you do n't want to talk , i can think of much more entertaining things to do than cooking . ''"
"not a word ."
"not even a glance in his direction to acknowledge that he 'd spoken !"
"she did n't want to hear his charming voice or humorous quips , and she definitely did n't want his sexual innuendos that made her shudder with need ."
"she 'd gotten a good night 's sleep last night and her body had fully recuperated ."
"more than willing to sample more of the same ."
"but he had the fabulous farida now ."
"he could just go do whatever with the other woman ."
"dana did n't need the irritation ."
"although if he came any closer with that farida-like grin , she might just start chopping off body parts , she thought furiously ."
"she did not want him , she told herself ."
"she would not accept seconds ."
"leftovers were just ... .uhg !"
"she had to resist as hassan came closer ."
"dana was n't any man 's sexual receptacle ."
"if he wanted a willing woman , let him get farida back ."
"that woman was more than happy to volunteer her body to ease his sexual needs ."
"the horrible woman had broadcast her intentions loud and clear , shouting it with her body language and her cloying perfume ."
"dana actually missed the cucumber completely at the idea of that horrible , smelly woman in hassan 's arms ."
"hassan picked up the cucumber and handed it back to her , quickly removing his fingers from her knife range ."
"`` want to talk about it ? ''"
"`` what 's 'it ' ? ''"
"she asked , knowing full well what he meant but not wanting to give in to him ."
"she attacked the cucumber with more energy than skill , missing almost as often as she sliced and making the cucumber mess look as unappetizing as possible ."
"he leaned against the steel counter and watched her carefully ."
"he knew she was upset , but he could n't imagine what he 'd done lately to make her this angry ."
"`` whatever is bothering you ? ''"
"she scraped the mutilated cucumber into the salad , ignoring the curious look hassan gave the pile of mushed up green gupe ."
"`` nothing is bothering me ."
"why would you think something is bothering you ? ''"
"he paused for a moment to watch her ."
"`` well , unless you 're adding your fingers or parts of the cutting board to the salad intentionally , i 'm guessing you 're extremely angry with something ."
"possibly me , but i 'm not really sure what i did in the past twelve hours to make you angry with me . ''"
"`` besides keeping me a prisoner in your house ? ''"
"he chuckled as a carrot flew across the room when she tried to stab it and missed ."
"`` you 're not really mad at me for that ."
"i think you 're hiding from whatever you 're running from , which you 'll eventually tell me about , but that 's not what this is about . ''"
"she spun the knife around in her hand , gripping the handle upside down and stabbed the wooden cutting board with the tip violently ."
"`` oh , and you know me so well after our short time together that you can say that with authority ? ''"
"he crunched on a celery stick , watching her face for a long moment ."
"`` yes , i think i 'm pretty on target . ''"
"`` you 're not ."
"way off base , but keep it up and i 'll get angry for other reasons . ''"
"a timer went off behind her and she spun around , glad to have something else to distract her ."
"the man kept snatching her vegetables which put his long , strong fingers into her field of vision , driving her crazy because she wanted those fingers to be moving across her body the way they had the other night ."
"and she knew she no longer had that right ."
"`` you 'd feel much better if you talked to me about it . ''"
"she pulled her cakes out of the oven and kicked the door closed with her foot , carrying both over to the table and putting them carefully onto the cooling rack ."
"`` i 'm fine , '' she replied once again ."
"`` okay then ."
"what can i do to help ? ''"
"he asked and pulled an apron off of one of the shelves , tying it around his waist just as she 'd done ."
"she stared at him with an astonished expression ."
"`` you ca n't cook . ''"
"`` of course not ."
"but i can follow instructions ."
"you 've been doing it with me all day ."
"how hard can it be ? ''"
"she watched him as if he 'd gone completely crazy ."
"`` hassan , go find farida and leave me alone . ''"
"she turned away and headed into the pantry for sugar to make the frosting ."
"dana was fighting back the tears , praying that he 'd be gone by the time she came out of the pantry and she could figure out what to do ."
"she just needed some space and time to put the past few days into perspective ."
"and she needed a plan !"
"every time she tried to do something positive , something that might get her out of this mess , he intervened ."
"she really had to assert herself , she thought as she carried the powdered sugar and milk back to the counter ."
"several feet away from her cooking space , she stopped and stared at hassan ."
"he was now standing in her work space , leaning his back against the counter with his arms crossed in front of him ."
"he was the perfect imitation of an immoveable object ."
"she released the breath she had n't realized she 'd been holding and gripped the sugar more tightly ."
"`` why ca n't you just leave me alone ? ''"
"she growled , furious with him and his persistence ."
"he shrugged slightly before he said , `` because you 're gorgeous and i ca n't get you out of my mind . ''"
"she dropped her supplies onto the counter and shoved herself away from him as he closed the distance ."
"`` you have more self-discipline than any man i 've ever known in my life ."
"display some right now . ''"
"`` ca n't , '' he replied simply and took another step closer to her ."
"she put her hand in the middle of his chest and tried to hold him at arm 's length ."
"`` ca n't ?"
"or wo n't ? ''"
"he chuckled and shook his head , running a finger down her bare arm and sending shivers along her skin ."
"`` maybe a little of both . ''"
"she suppressed the instant shiver and stepped away , turning from his smile and trying to ignore him ."
"she was just turning back to her cooking area when she spotted him sticking his finger into the frosting ."
"with an irritated sound , she picked up the plastic spatula and smacked the back of his hand just as his hand was reaching for another sample ."
"`` ouch ! ''"
"he pulled his hand away quickly and looked up at her with surprise ."
"`` you hit me ! ''"
"she took the bowl of frosting and swirled in flavoring ."
"`` of course i smacked you ."
"you were sneaking frosting . ''"
"`` so ? ''"
"she glared at him ."
"`` no sneaking , '' she replied with finality ."
"he leaned forward to watch her stir ."
"`` you know , i could have you imprisoned for hitting me . ''"
"`` please ! ''"
"she scoffed and turned away just as his finger started to dive for yet another taste ."
"`` you deserved it and i 'll do it again if you do n't stay out of my frosting . ''"
"`` even so , '' he replied with amusement ."
"`` you ca n't smack the ruler ."
"it just is n't done . ''"
"`` it 's done when you deserve it , '' she countered and added pink food coloring in an effort to deter him ."
"surely he would n't nip a taste of pink frosting ."
"he was too manly to be caught with a pink glob on the end of his finger ."
"`` even with the threat of imprisonment ? ''"
"`` you would n't imprison me . ''"
"he watched her with surprise , knowing she was right but he was n't going to lose this argument ."
"`` you 're awfully confident ."
"what makes you so sure ? ''"
"`` because i would cry . ''"
"she stopped stirring and looked up at him ."
"`` and i 'm guessing you 're the kind of guy who hates it when a woman cries . ''"
"he watched her for a moment , then sighed , nodding his head ."
"`` you 're right . ''"
"he took another cucumber and leaned his hip against the table ."
"`` so what are the odds you might become unangry with me and come to my bed ? ''"
"she gritted her teeth and turned away ."
"`` chances are around the zero to nil range , '' she countered ."
"with a grimace he sighed ."
"`` okay ."
"so you need to get over whatever put you in this snit ."
"how about if i give you a little space and we can talk about our relationship tomorrow ? ''"
"she slammed the bowl down onto the table and braced her hands on the steel surface ."
"`` you can talk all you want ."
"i 'm guessing there really is n't anything you can say that i 'd be interested in hearing ."
"but when has that stopped you from discussing your opinion ? ''"
"he considered arguing with her but knew that sometimes a strategic retreat was needed ."
"he came closer and looked down into her furious eyes ."
"`` hopefully you will come to me tomorrow and explain what it is that i did to hurt your feelings ."
"until then , just know that i 'll be in my suite thinking about you , and thinking about all the different ways i want to make love to you and only your stubbornness is keeping us apart . ''"
"her eyes narrowed and she held her breath , trying desperately hard not to throw herself into his arms and sob out all her frustration and anger , her hurt over hearing that he was engaged to another woman and how betrayed it had made her feel when she 'd heard it from someone she 'd just met instead of the man who had held her gently in his arms and taken her to heaven with his touch ."
"she hated the fact that she watched him walk away , taking the cowards way out with her silence instead of confronting him ."
"her eyes watched with longing as his broad shoulders and long legs took him out of the kitchen and away from her ."
"all she wanted to do was to run after him and beg him to explain , to demand that he choose her instead of that horrible woman ."
"but he was n't hers so she had no right to demand anything of him ."
"he was a grown man , so if he wanted to be with farida , he could and if he wanted another woman , he would have to do something about it but dana wanted nothing to do with a man who would sleep with one woman while engaged to another ."
"since he was walking away , she accepted that he 'd made his choice and she had too much pride to accept the role of mistress ."
"with resignation , she went back into the supply pantry and selected several ingredients to make a filling for her cake , determined to get that man out of her mind , or get fat trying ."
"by midnight , she had the cake frosted and decorated with a raspberry cream filling , a spinach salad with strawberries and warm roasted nuts topped with goat cheese and a zesty dressing , stuffed chicken breasts , a spicy jambalaya with shrimp and sausage and a pasta dish with a vodka cream sauce ."
"all the food was stored in plastic containers and she knew she should eat some of it , but her stomach simply would n't let her ."
"the fact that her throat was swollen with unshed tears did n't help either ."
"for the first time in her life , cooking had n't soothed her mind and calmed her body ."
"she was still so angry and hurt with hassan that she wanted to punch him ."
"but that would require touching him and she had to avoid that ."
"touching , in any way , would lead to things better left to her imagination ."
"she fell asleep that night , fighting back tears for a man she refused to cry over ."
"he was n't worth it if he was going to treat her like this ."
"she deserved so much better but she was n't going to find it if she did n't hurry up and figure out who was trying to kill her and mitigate that problem ."
"if she were n't so exhausted , she would head right back to her office and do some searches to find her next location ."
"but she could barely keep her eyes open so she let sleep take her away and hopefully soothe her the way her cooking had n't accomplished ."
"chapter 6 the following day , dana watched with relief as hassan walked down the hallway to his next meeting ."
"it would give her at least an hour away from him and she needed the break ."
"she had n't slept well last night and had been up early trying to catch up on all of the work he 'd left for her ."
"he might be charming , but he was a workaholic as well ."
"the annoying man had gone back to his own office last night and had worked on just about every project he had proposed ."
"and now he wanted reports and data and contracts , all of which she had to hunt down and figure out ."
"could n't he find some other kind of pastime besides working ?"
"as soon as he was around the corner , she stood up and poked her head out of her office doorway ."
"sure enough , two men were standing outside , apparently protecting her but it felt more like keeping her inside the palace walls ."
"`` excuse me , '' she said sweetly and smiled over at the two men ."
"`` could one or both of you help me with an issue i 'm having ? ''"
"both men straightened up slightly and moved towards her ."
"`` how can we help ? ''"
"the older one asked ."
"he had no hair but maintained a perfectly trimmed black goatee ."
"she wondered if baldness had a sort of mean message to someone who was going to infiltrate an area ."
"did the man shave his head intentionally ?"
"or was that just natural ?"
"refocusing on the important issue of the day , she came back around her desk and sat down behind it ."
"`` have a seat , '' she suggested and gestured to one of the chairs in her office ."
"`` what 's your name ? ''"
"`` i 'm sumeet , ma'am . ''"
"`` it 's nice to meet you sumeet ."
"it actually is n't my problem but a friend of mine is trying to locate someone who might not want to be found . ''"
"she 'd considered her words carefully while getting dressed this morning , in another suit that had magically appeared in her closet , and thought that maybe she could track down the guys trying to kill her ."
"if she got to him first , maybe she could convince him that she was content to let him lead his own nefarious life if he would just leave her alone ."
"`` if this were your friend , how would you go about finding this person ? ''"
"sumeet leaned forward , elbows on his knees and looked very serious as he narrowed his eyes in concentration ."
"`` what does this person do for a living ? ''"
"he asked ."
"dana bit her lit and considered her options ."
"`` he ... um ... might be of the criminal element , '' she said diplomatically ."
"she did n't want to reveal too much , but maybe there were ways to find a person in a legitimate business which might differ when trying to find someone of the more unscrupulous occupations ."
"she had no idea , and needed sumeet 's expertise ."
"sumeet nodded sagely ."
"`` how did they meet ? ''"
"dana was n't sure how to answer this without revealing too much ."
"she thought about various ways to answer but in the end , stuck to a very non-descriptive explanation ."
"`` she sort of saw something she should n't have . ''"
"`` was this in the united states ? ''"
"`` yes , '' she replied quickly , relieved that it was a question that was easy to answer ."
"everyone knew she was american so it was extremely logical that dana would still have friends back there ."
"he narrowed his eyes as he watched her carefully ."
"`` was it a violent crime ? ''"
"dana nodded ."
"`` very violent . ''"
"`` why was n't your friend put into the witness protection system ?"
"i heard that agency was very good at hiding people from the criminal element when they had witnessed something violent . ''"
"now she was treading in dangerous waters ."
"she had to be very careful how she answered this one for fear that she might reveal too much ."
"pursing her lips , she tapped her pencil against her mouth gently ."
"`` maybe i should just tell her that she needs to hire someone ."
"if she were to do that , who would she hire ?"
"how does one contact an investigative agency that might handle this kind of work ? ''"
"sumeet did n't blink an eye as he absorbed her response ."
"`` there are several reputable investigative agencies ."
"why do n't you tell me your friend 's name and i can refer her to one of my friends ? ''"
"dana became excited that she might have an outlet ."
"`` oh , no !"
"if you could just tell me how to contact them , i 'll pass along the information . ''"
"`` it would be better if the two of them contacted each other directly . ''"
"the man was starting to get on her nerves ."
"why was he being so covert about offering information on a private detective agency ?"
"`` could n't you just give me the agency name that you trust the most and i can pass that along to her ?"
"she 's sort of in hiding and this will allow her to contact the investigator directly without revealing her location . ''"
"`` is her location an issue ? ''"
"dana shook her head ."
"`` oh , no ."
"she 's safe ."
"at least for the time being . ''"
"`` you 're sure ? ''"
"she thought back to the men in the marketplace and the sporadic phone calls on her cell phone ."
"`` pretty sure . ''"
"sumeet nodded and stood up ."
"`` i 'll get you several names ."
"just give me a day . ''"
"`` that would be wonderful !"
"and you 'll let me know which is the best ?"
"i do n't know if she can afford the best , but she should definitely start there , right ? ''"
"sumeet almost smiled at her enthusiasm but he nodded seriously and stepped back out into the hallway to resume his guard post ."
"the other man saw the look and nodded slightly , lifting his watch to type in a message ."
"a few minutes later and known to dana , a third guard arrived and took up position while sumeet walked down the hallway to make a report ."
"dana turned back to her computer and dug back into her work , feeling much more relieved now that she had a plan of action ."
"she had one more part of that idea to work on and that was to find another place to hide out ."
"as her fingers worked the keyboard , her mind considered all the various possibilities ."
"the peace corps sounded pretty good ."
"did n't they send people to places where almost no one could find them ?"
"or a mission in africa ?"
"she also liked the idea of helping other people if that was possible ."
"her fingers tapped out different locations and organizations that might work out for her ."
"one problem she kept running into was an escape route ."
"if she were found , she did n't like the idea of being out in the middle of the desert or jungle with no way of hiding and no easy way to get back to civilization ."
"wherever she went , it would need to be a place where she could blend in with a population large enough for a person to live , but still give her anonymity ."
"and a job ."
"she had to support herself somehow even though the idea of living in the jungle in a tree house and living off of nuts and berries sounded pretty good right about now ."
"unfortunately , the jungles of africa or south america might be a perfect hiding spot , but it did n't have a great number of possible occupations ."
"especially the tree house idea ."
"the afternoon was just as crazy as the morning but with the added pressure of hassan barking orders at her ."
"he constantly demanded that she come into his office and take notes during his meetings , something he had n't done before ."
"he 'd always preferred that the meetings be recorded and she would transcribe them after the fact ."
"since she did n't know shorthand , actually being in the meeting was a great deal of pressure to try and write down all that was being said ."
"it was still being recorded , but she felt the need to get the important points down carefully ."
"and since no one wasted hassan 's time , all the issues brought up were important , conversations limited to only those issues that needed his attention while idle chit chat was kept to a minimum ."
"by the end of the day , she was tired and hungry , and very irritated with the man who had kept her at his side during most of the day for no apparent reason ."
"she was shutting down her computer when he walked into her office and sat in one of her empty chairs , a plate filled with her jambalaya ."
"`` this is delicious , '' he said with a mouthful of shrimp ."
"`` i know you made this last night and i 'm impressed . ''"
"she really did n't like the way her stomach quivered with excitement over his compliment ."
"`` do n't you have some big dinner party tonight with the ambassadors ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"will you come with me ? ''"
"he asked and took another bite of the spicy rice dish ."
"she watched him with exasperation ."
"`` why are you eating if you have a twenty course meal to sit through ? ''"
"she glared at him angrily ."
"`` and why do n't you ever gain weight ? ''"
"`` because i do n't want to eat their food ."
"i want to eat this . ''"
"he took another bite and looked across the desk ."
"`` you did n't answer my question ."
"will you be my guest tonight ? ''"
"she tossed out the first answer she thought of ."
"`` i have nothing to wear , '' she said without emphasis and stuffed more files into her desk ."
"`` i 'm fine with nothing , '' he replied , completely dead pan so it took several minutes for his words to sink in ."
"at which time , her traitorous body responded by blushing profusely and her heart speeding up ."
"`` get real , '' she scoffed and shoved the last file into her desk ."
"`` have fun tonight . ''"
"he placed the now empty plate on her desk and wiped his mouth with a linen napkin ."
"`` i 'll have a dress delivered to your room in a half hour ."
"be ready for me in an hour . ''"
"with that , he bent over and kissed her lightly and was gone down the hallway before she could argue with him or even agree to be his guest ."
"she glared at the empty plate with a mutinous expression but not because he 'd left her something to clean up ."
"there was a cleaning service that came through the office areas and cleaned up all the plates , coffee cups and emptied the trash so she did n't care about that ."
"it was that he 'd just swooped in and swished out , not even caring that she might still be angry with him ."
"she did n't really believe he could have a dress to her within the time he 'd mentioned but she should have realized that hassan never did things in half measures ."
"she was sitting in the small sitting room of her suite , finishing up some of the files from the day , when a knock sounded on the door ."
"she had no idea who might come to see her but knew the guards hassan had assigned to her would n't let anyone past that was n't allowed so she answered the door without hesitation ."
"and then her mouth fell open ."
"a man stood outside with a whole rack of gorgeous evening gowns in all the colors of the rainbow , each one more beautiful than the last ."
"he pushed them inside with a smile and a bow , and then disappeared , closing the door behind him saying only `` compliments of his highness '' before he was gone ."
"dana was left staring at about thirty gorgeous gowns , each one probably worth more than her monthly salary ."
"she picked up one and held it against the front of her , looking in the mirror to see what it looked like ."
"needless to say , it was perfect ."
"as was the next and the next , all the colors that worked well with her skin tone and coloring , and all in her size ."
"`` how does he know all this stuff ? ''"
"she said out loud as she pulled on a pretty lavender gown with a chiffon skirt and beaded halter style top ."
"it made her breasts look bigger somehow and her hips smaller ."
"as she twirled around , she knew that she was in love with this dress ."
"the second knock came while she was pulling on an emerald green sheath dress that skimmed all her curves , covering her from neck to ankle , but leaving little to the imagination ."
"she answered the door , her hands covering the upper half of her dress because of how her breasts , or more specifically , her nipples , were providing good evidence of their existence ."
"dana was n't prepared for hassan to be standing outside the door , nor was she ready for him to be so devastatingly handsome in his beautifully tailored tuxedo ."
"but as soon as she opened the door , his eyes dropped to her dress and instantly fired with desire ."
"`` absolutely not ! ''"
"he said and pushed his way into the room , slamming the door behind him ."
"`` there is no way you 're leaving this room in that dress , '' he growled ."
"he looked back at her in the dress and she could see that he liked it , just not with anyone but himself looking at her ."
"with a glance , he moved over to the rack of clothes and surveyed the alternatives , picking out the lavender dress she 'd initially tried on first ."
"`` this one , '' he commanded and walked over to hand it to her ."
"`` why that one ? ''"
"she asked , not taking the dress for fear of needing to drop her hands ."
"which would in turn reveal what he probably knew was underneath her arms , but she did n't want to be obvious about it ."
"especially with a bed so close by ."
"his eyes dropped down to her bare shoulders , skimming along her figure where her arms were n't covering ."
"`` because purple will look good on you ."
"and there 's no way i 'm letting you out of this room in that dress so just take it off now . ''"
"he smiled slightly before saying , `` maybe you could put it on for me later , just so i can take it off personally . ''"
"dana almost laughed , feeling giddy that he was somewhat jealous of other men seeing her like this ."
"`` i was n't going to wear it anyway ."
"i just liked the color . ''"
"he nodded and crossed his arms over his chest arrogantly ."
"`` good ."
"hurry up ."
"we 're going to be late and if we 're going to be late , it 's going to be for a good reason . ''"
"`` what would be a good reason in your mind ? ''"
"she asked , taking the dress and walking into the bathroom to change ."
"it occurred to her that she had n't actually agreed to go to this dinner thing with him ."
"he 'd simply ordered her to get ready and here she was , getting ready ."
"if the dress was n't so gorgeous and he had n't looked so marvelous in his tuxedo , she might have argued with him a bit ."
"he leaned down so his face was less than an inch from hers , his eyes showing her how much he wanted her ."
"`` anything that has to do with you being naked and in a bed ."
"or out of a bed , '' he growled ."
"`` in that dress , i do n't care where you are ."
"a wall will even work at this point so hurry up and change or we 're going to miss the whole event and i will make sure you do n't care that you 're still mad at me . ''"
"she scurried into the bathroom and kept her eyes off of his magnificent form , praying she could get away without dissolving into a puddle of desire ."
"`` i 'm not , '' she sighed from behind the door , glad that he could n't hear her ."
"she needed him to think she was still mad at him so she could keep her distance but she just could n't maintain that anger ."
"she was hurt and sad that he preferred farida over her , but she could n't blame him ."
"the woman was stunning ."
"`` hurry up , '' he called out ."
"she unzipped the green dress and pulled on the lavender one , trying to figure out what to do with her hair that was fast and simple ."
"`` what 's this thing about tonight ? ''"
"she called through the closed door ."
"`` the french ambassador and his wife are here for dinner . ''"
"`` wow ! ''"
"she whispered ."
"in a louder voice she called back , `` and you want me to attend with you ? ''"
"she felt a warm glow start to heat inside her , proud that he thought enough of her skills to ask her to attend such an important meeting with him ."
"`` yes ."
"if you 'd hurry up , '' he called back ."
"`` why did n't you ask farida to be your guest ? ''"
"she said then bit her tongue , wishing she had n't said that out loud ."
"`` because i did n't want to be with her tonight . ''"
"that was the right answer , she thought ."
"but she had to maintain her position and not get lost in his sweet words ."
"she swept her hair back and pinned it neatly at the nape of her neck , added a bit more powder , some purple eye shadow and soft pink lipstick ."
"`` do i iook okay ? ''"
"she asked , coming out of the bathroom and finding him sitting on the sofa reading a magazine ."
"he looked surprised to see her finished so quickly and glanced at his watch ."
"`` that took you less than five minutes , '' he mumbled , standing up and coming towards her ."
"`` how did you do that so quickly ? ''"
"`` you told me we were going to be late . ''"
"he glanced down at his watch once again ."
"`` we were ."
"if you 'd taken an hour to get ready like i assumed you would . ''"
"`` so now we 're early ? ''"
"he chuckled at her disgruntled expression and moved closer ."
"`` what shall we do with the extra time ? ''"
"she stepped back and put her hand up to the middle of his chest to stop him in his tracks ."
"`` not what you 're thinking ."
"remember ?"
"i 'm still mad at you . ''"
"he pushed her hand away and pulled her closer ."
"`` no you 're not . ''"
"she accepted his touch , thrilling to the way he was so possessive of her , but unwilling to give in on this issue ."
"`` yes i am , '' she said and tucked her lipstick into his breast pocket ."
"`` you 're not ."
"i heard you through the bathroom door ."
"and that 's not my color , '' he joked , referring to her lipstick ."
"`` funny man ."
"it 's for me ."
"i do n't have a purse . ''"
"`` so i get the honor of carrying your lipstick ? ''"
"`` dubious honor , but yes . ''"
"she marched out of the suite and smiled to her guards ."
"`` and yes , i am still mad at you ."
"i 'm just not showing it . ''"
"he chuckled and put a hand to the small of her back to guide her towards the formal dining room where they would meet their guests ."
"dana waited until she was introduced to the ambassador and his wife , but then stepped forward and smiled graciously ."
"`` bon soir , '' she said effortlessly ."
"`` comment t'alley vous ce soir ? ''"
"in perfect french ."
"three sets of eyes widened in surprise and dana maintained her serene expression , glad to have surprised hassan with her knowledge of foreign languages ."
"it was , after all , one of the reasons she 'd been moved into her current position so she did n't understand why he was surprised ."
"the evening turned out to be a great success with hassan and the ambassador agreeing to several issues while dana and the ambassador 's wife discussed other country 's politics or lapsed into the traditional and easy conversational topics such as fashion or travel ."
"the meal was delicious , as predicted and it was nice to sit at the table with only the four of them and discuss politics ."
"dana watched in fascination as hassan worked the french ambassador , getting through his points and acknowledging the ambassador 's as well ."
"they were dancing a very fine minuet , she thought ."
"neither giving in on a subject until the other conceded something as well , so both parties came away from the evening feeling as if they 'd gained something important , all the while pretending that the meal was only a social event ."
"after waving goodbye to the ambassador and his wife , dana yawned hugely and smiled her thanks to the wait staff who had helped during the meal ."
"she then turned and walked out of the dining room , heading back to her own suite and away from hassan and his charming self ."
"`` where are you going ? ''"
"hassan asked as they left the dining room ."
"dana automatically turned to the right which would take her to her suite while hassan was pulling her to the left towards his private quarters ."
"`` i 'm going to bed . ''"
"he pulled her flush against his body , pressing her against him so she could understand ."
"`` that was exactly my intention . ''"
"dana could feel his body harden against her stomach and tried to push him away , closing her eyes in an effort to block out pictures of what he might do to her ."
"`` no , '' she said but it was a weak and breathless protest ."
"she had to remember farida and not give in , she told herself firmly ."
"`` you 're mouth is saying no , but your body is leaning into mine , your hands are around my neck and you 're shivering with expectation . ''"
"dana opened her eyes and realized that her arms were in fact around his neck ."
"she pulled them down and tried to step back , but he held her hips , pressing her close while his head bent down ."
"when his lips touched her neck , she could n't help but shiver with more than expectation ."
"it was anticipation , bold , heavy and overwhelming ."
"`` you ca n't do that , '' she whispered but felt her head lean to the left so he had better access ."
"`` what ca n't i do ? ''"
"he breathed against her ear ."
"`` this ? ''"
"he asked as his teeth nibbled on her earlobe ."
"`` yes . ''"
"`` and maybe i ca n't do this ? ''"
"and his hand went to her back , sliding around her rib cage and cupping her breast with his strong hands ."
"`` and you 'd really hate it if i did this , would n't you ? ''"
"he asked as his expert fingers unsnapped the halter dress and revealed her breast , exposing it to his hands and dana did n't even care that they were in the middle of the hallway and anyone could pass by ."
"when his thumb ran over her nipple , she was lost and she gasped as the pleasure surged through her ."
"she was no longer leaning against him , she was pressing herself closer , demanding more of him and shuddering when he pressed himself against her softness ."
"`` damn you , hassan ! ''"
"she exclaimed , her hands fisting on his jacket ."
"`` tell me you want me , '' he demanded , his voice husky and deep ."
"`` i do n't want to want you . ''"
"`` you 're beautiful when you 're being stubborn ."
"tell me , '' he ordered again , emphasizing his command with his thumb barely against her nipple ."
"dana held her breath , waiting for his touch but when it did n't come , she nodded her head ."
"`` yes , '' she gasped ."
"`` yes , i want you ! ''"
"when his thumb rubbed her nipple as she wanted she almost cried out with the pleasure but he covered her mouth with his , capturing the sound and giving her more ."
"he leaned back slightly and reattached the halter on her dress ."
"with swift movements , he took her hand and led her quickly down the hallway ."
"once there , he slammed the door to his suite , then swept her up into his arms , carrying her over to the bed and placing her in the center ."
"`` you 're beautiful , '' he said with his husky , sexy voice while his hands threw off his tuxedo jacket , his tie and his deft fingers started unbuttoning his shirt ."
"he leaned over her , unwilling to wait until he 'd finished with his shirt before he touched her again , kissing her gently , then with increasing pressure as she wrapped her arms around his neck ."
"dana knew there were some reasons she should n't be here ."
"but when his hands pulled her dress down again , his mouth covering her nipple and making her gasp with the intensity of the pleasure his mouth was creating , she could n't think of a single reason not to be right here , right now , in this bed with this man and his magical hands and mouth ."
"`` touch me , '' hassan said and pulled her hands from the bed where her fingers were gripping the silk duvet , placing them on his chest ."
"dana did n't wait for another invitation , letting her fingers roam over his chest , thrilling in the light mat of hair and the muscles that flexed wherever she touched ."
"while she let her fingers roam , hassan kissed his way down her neck , over her chest and made a slow trail to her right breast , sucking her nipple until she was moaning with the pleasure and her legs moved up , wrapping around his waist in invitation ."
"`` i love the way you feel , '' he said softly as his hand pressed her leg against his hip , moving into place ."
"`` i 'm sorry , dana ."
"i ca n't wait . ''"
"he wanted to touch her more , to feel her hands against his body and taste her just like he had last time , but after tonight , seeing her in that dress and speaking in perfect french , laughing with his guests and now seeing her with desire in her eyes , it was such a dichotomy and he loved the differences ."
"she shook her head , trying to tell him that she did n't care about waiting , that she did n't want him to wait ."
"but her body told him for her , speaking loud enough for both of them to hear ."
"or maybe that was just her scream as he slid into her slowly driving her crazy with the need for him to fill her up ."
"`` do n't move ! ''"
"she cried out but he did n't listen to her ."
"as he watched , he was amazed that she was already tightening around him ."
"he continued moving , using her facial expressions and sighs of pleasure as a gauge on how to move , slower and faster , creating just the right friction to take her over the edge ."
"he could n't believe what a turn on it was to watch and feel this tiny woman climax around him and he pounded into her , finding his own release moments later ."
"when he could breathe once again , he pulled her close and sighed as he felt her snuggle into his side , her face pressed against his neck so he could feel her soft , sweet breath against him ."
"as his heart slowed down , he felt her body relax against him and he almost chuckled when she slid her leg up on top of his as if she needed to hold him down even in her sleep ."
"he knew exactly how she felt , wanting to keep her safe but not sure what he was protecting her against ."
"and that drove him crazy , until she snuggled up closer and he relaxed since she was right where he wanted her at the moment ."
"he 'd take care of 'later ' when morning arrived ."
"dana woke up , startled by the darkness and tried to orient herself ."
"but the room was unfamiliar and she could n't place the heaviness she was feeling ."
"as her eyes became adjusted to the darkness , she realized that she was in hassan 's bed and her arms and legs were tangled with his , the sheets somewhere at the bottom of the bed and his body heat was currently the only thing keeping her warm with the extra efficient air conditioning cooling down the air ."
"she let her head drop back down onto hassan 's shoulder and took a deep breath , trying to figure out how she 'd ended up right back in his bed , the one place she 'd been trying hard to avoid ."
"it was that damn lavender dress , she thought ."
"the neckline had been too easy to release ."
"maybe she should get something more difficult next time ."
"then she sighed and shook her head slightly ."
"it was more than just the neckline ."
"it was the man ."
"he had magic fingers ."
"and magic lips ."
"she looked over at him in the darkness and accepted that it was n't just a part of him , it was the whole package ."
"this man 's body was pretty amazing , she thought as her leg shifted slightly to feel him once again ."
"but no more , she mentally chided herself and pulled her leg away ."
"she could n't be `` the other woman '' and she definitely would n't be a mistress to a man she ... .loved ."
"she accepted the word hesitantly , feeling her heart clench with the pain even though there was a bit of joy in the admission ."
"right now , she needed to deal with the moment and not the future ."
"slowly , so she did n't disturb him , she extricated herself from his warm body ."
"sliding off the bed , she quietly picked up her dress and slipped it back on , finding her shoes by the door but her underwear was completely lost , an embarrassing state of affairs but she was n't going to try and find them in order to rectify her underwear free predicament ."
"with her shoes in her hand , she tiptoed out of his bedroom , glancing back occasionally to see if he was awake ."
"dana slowly , carefully opened the door to his suite , then slipped out into the hallway and closed it behind her , turning the handle so it would n't click upon release and wake up hassan ."
"when the door was finally closed , she let go of the breath she had been holding and turned around , wondering if anyone had seen her slipping out of his rooms and praying she 'd gone unnoticed ."
"until she straightened , preparing to walk down the hallway and four men , all standing at attention , were looking down at her with blank expressions ."
"since it was about two o'clock in the morning , her hair was a complete mess and she was holding her shoes in her hands , there was absolutely no way to pretend like she 'd been in his room for any reason other than the truth ."
"she was extremely grateful they did n't know she had no underwear on !"
"`` there 's really no way to sneak around this place , is there ? ''"
"she asked with a grimace ."
"the four men , bless their souls , did n't even crack a smile or change their expressions in any way ."
"nor did they bother to respond , since the truth was obvious ."
"`` okay , i guess i 'd better ... oomph ! ''"
"dana had no idea what happened , but one moment she was about to walk down the hallway to her room and the next she was picked up and thrown almost upside down ."
"when she finally got her hair out of her eyes and looked up , she 'd figured out that hassan had discovered her absence ."
"he 'd simply picked her up , tossed her over his shoulder and was now carrying her back to bed ."
"a glance at the four men before the door was slammed shut , showed that they were still standing at attention , all with completely blank expressions on their faces ."
"she 'd bet money that they started chuckling after the door was slammed shut though !"
"`` do n't you dare touch me you two timer ! ''"
"she cried out , punching him on the back , the only place she could reach in this undignified position ."
"he stopped in the middle of his living room and looked back at her ."
"`` what the hell are you talking about , woman ? ''"
"`` put me down ! ''"
"he lowered her gently to the floor , but kept a grip on her arms , not letting her run or hit him as she glared up at him ."
"`` explain yourself ! ''"
"`` farida ?"
"your fiancee ?"
"how conveniently you forget about the woman who has been waiting patiently to marry you ."
"does she know that you have no scruples when it comes to sharing yourself with others ? ''"
"hassan looked at her with outrage ."
"`` is that why you were so angry with me two nights ago ?"
"because you thought that farida and i are engaged ? ''"
"`` i did n't think anything ."
"she told me the two of you were engaged . ''"
"`` she 's lying ."
"i have never proposed to her , nor will i ever propose to that woman . ''"
"dana listened , but the words took several moments to sink in ."
"`` you 're not engaged to her ? ''"
"she asked in a smaller voice , the hope rising to the surface of her anger , letting her see through the red haze of fury she 'd been in for the past few minutes ."
"`` you 're not going to marry her ? ''"
"`` of course not ! ''"
"he put his hands on his hips and glared right back ."
"`` if you thought i was engaged , why did n't you come and ask me about it ?"
"and more importantly , why did you sleep with me tonight ? ''"
"dana could n't hold his gaze and her eyes sank to his chest ."
"a very nice , very naked chest with that interesting dent in the middle of it where his rib cage connected ."
"`` i did n't really ... .that is ... i suppose that i might have ... . ''"
"`` you could n't resist me , is that what you 're trying to say ? ''"
"he asked with a satisfied grin and his arrogance came roaring back ."
"she groaned and was about to turn around and walk out on him but he grabbed her by the arms and held her still ."
"`` dana , with everything you 've put me through over the past few weeks , i think i deserve an answer . ''"
"`` fine ! ''"
"she snapped and pulled her arms away ."
"`` yes !"
"i get a little ... .crazy when you touch me ."
"okay ?"
"is that what you wanted to hear ? ''"
"hassan did n't say a word ."
"he simply picked her up and tossed her into the middle of the bed ."
"with one knee on the bed , he reached down to her , unclasped the neckline of the dress and pulled it off ."
"`` yes ."
"that 's exactly what i wanted to hear you gorgeous , annoying woman ! ''"
"one moment he was standing above her , the next she was being hauled against him while his body slid into hers ."
"she gasped with surprise when he easily slid into her warmth and she automatically raised her hips to accommodate him better ."
"with her hands against his shoulders , holding on , she cried out with the pleasure he gave her ."
"before he allowed the storm to climax though , he stopped and stared down at her ."
"`` you 're mine , dana ."
"say it ! ''"
"`` yes ! ''"
"she cried out and tried to move just that small inch that would take her over but he held her steady ."
"`` yes !"
"i 'm yours ."
"all yours ! ''"
"with that exclamation , he drove into her , giving her the release she needed so desperately ."
"when the storm had calmed and her breathing was almost back to normal , hassan pulled her down , tossing one leg over hers , then promptly fell asleep ."
"dana stared up at the ceiling , wondering how he could control her body so completely ."
"she drifted off to sleep herself , snuggling against his warmth since he still had n't brought the sheet or blanket up to cover them ."
"chapter 7 `` looking up places to hide ? ''"
"hassan asked , leaning against her office doorway with his arms crossed over his chest ."
"dana looked up at him , startled that he would ask such a thing ."
"especially since he was right on target ."
"`` places to hide ? ''"
"why would i be trying to get away and hide ? ''"
"she tried to look innocent and confused , but she suspected her expression just came across as guilty ."
"hassan stepped into her office and leaned down against her desk , holding her eyes with his own intense gaze ."
"`` because you witnessed a guy being murdered while in the subway of new york city and are a witness who could bring down an entire drug cartel since there were others standing by , the deputies of that cartel who seriously want you dead ."
"so now there are several hit men out to try and kill you . ''"
"she swallowed painfully ."
"`` several ? ''"
"her voice was weak with the realization that more than one person was trying to kill her ."
"she 'd know there had been four men at the marketplace , but had convinced herself that it had been only one guy trying to kill her with a multiple pronged approach ."
"`` you have a bounty on your head that 's impressive ."
"at least , that 's what my sources are telling me . ''"
"she slumped back into her chair , unsure what to do now ."
"it was one thing when one guy was trying to get to her ."
"but now there was a competition to kill her among professional hit men ?"
"where could she possibly be safe from that kind of fire power ?"
"`` when were you going to tell me ? ''"
"he sat down in her extra chair and watched her , noting that her face was pale and her eyes becoming frantic ."
"she bit her lip , trying hard not to cry ."
"`` probably never . ''"
"he stared at her hard ."
"`` you were just going to leave me ? ''"
"dana did n't like the expression on his face ."
"it was hard ."
"and dangerously blank ."
"`` yes , '' she admitted , unwilling to lie to him now that he knew the danger he was in ."
"she could n't complicate the issue by half truths or outright lies any longer ."
"`` and you were n't going to trust me with this kind of information ?"
"you were n't going to ask me for help ? ''"
"she shook her head ."
"he tried to remain calm in the face of her distrust but it was difficult ."
"the woman he loved , the one who drove him crazy with her opinions that were so opposite his own but that he wanted in his life for the rest of his days was trying to run away from him and would n't even ask him for help ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"dana looked away , unable to watch the anger and hurt on his face ."
"she wanted so much to admit what was in her heart , but she was terrified of what he might say , what is reaction to her feelings for him might be ."
"there was a long silence while she formed her answer ."
"`` because these men are dangerous and i ... .did n't want you to get hurt , '' she finally said , hoping the words did n't reveal too much ."
"unfortunately , the idea of hassan getting hit by a bullet meant for her was just too much to bear ."
"she turned back to him and shook her head ."
"`` just let me leave here ."
"i ... . ''"
"he interrupted her strangled words , finishing her sentence for her ."
"`` you do n't want me to get hurt . ''"
"`` yes , '' she said , fighting back the tears that formed in her eyes at the idea of anything happening to him ."
"`` and you would become very upset if anything were to happen to me ? ''"
"it was more of a statement than a question ."
"`` yes . ''"
"`` because you love me . ''"
"her eyes flashed up to his and she cringed , the tears streaming down her face ."
"he knew ."
"she could tell by the expression on his face that he knew the truth ."
"there was no point in denying it any longer , so she nodded slowly ."
"`` and you were going to leave here to take the hit men out of my range . ''"
"`` yes , '' she whispered ."
"he contemplated what she had said and wondered how he could get through that stubborn brain of hers ."
"she was so beautiful , both inside and out and she matched his passion like no other woman ."
"she was the only person who was n't afraid of him either ."
"her frankness and openness were refreshing and sexy as hell ."
"and she was planning to leave him ."
"because she loved him ."
"`` you ca n't leave me , '' he said softly , but with a finality that made the tears flow more quickly ."
"`` if you leave , i 'll find you . ''"
"`` you ca n't . ''"
"`` i will . ''"
"`` why ? ''"
"`` because i love you too . ''"
"the simple words were spoken so plainly , she was n't sure if she had heard them correctly ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"`` you heard me . ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` no ."
"i think i heard you say that you love me . ''"
"he did n't wait any longer ."
"he stood up and moved around her desk , pulling her out of her chair and into his arms ."
"`` damn you woman !"
"i love you and you 're making me a mad man by telling me that you 're going to leave me and put yourself in danger just to keep me from being in danger ."
"i wo n't allow it ! ''"
"with that , he kissed her so thoroughly , she was n't able to respond for several minutes ."
"when he finally lifted his head and looked down at her , he was satisfied with the dazed look in her eyes ."
"`` so now that we have that out of the way , why do n't you tell me the whole story and i can fix this issue for you . ''"
"he did n't release her but leaned back against her desk , bringing her between his legs with his hands hooked behind her back ."
"she shrugged and looked at his chest , her hands fluttering about on his shoulders and arms ."
"`` there is n't much to tell ."
"i saw a guy get murdered , now the people who did it want me out of the picture ."
"i even promised not to testify but i guess in their line of business , they tend to be a bit less trusting ."
"occupational hazard i assume , '' she said , trying to make a joke about it but it just came across as sad and frustrated ."
"`` it 's hard to hide from those kinds of people , i 'm finding ."
"they have tentacles in so many areas , and talk about a global business !"
"they 're everywhere ! ''"
"`` is that why the witness protection agency would n't take you into their protective custody ?"
"because you refused to testify ? ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` no ."
"i was more than willing to be the star witness , '' she replied , drawing in a shaky breath as the memories came flooding back ."
"she closed her eyes , willing herself to tell him the worst of it ."
"`` the marshals i was assigned to were wonderful ."
"they were so amazing and brave and in the end , even they could n't protect me . ''"
"a tear dropped from her eyes down her cheek as she remembered the man and woman who had covered her with their weapons firing as quickly as possible while she ran for safety , diving into a truck while they stayed behind ."
"the other agents outside , keeping fire away from her ."
"`` the drug cartel guys found me in wisconsin and there were so many bullets ."
"the marshals , beth and joe , they tried to protect me ."
"they were great , teaming up against the hit men who had been sent to get me out of the way ."
"they shouted for me to get into the car , tossing me their keys while they kept the bad guys at a distance ."
"i 'd gotten the keys in the ignition and the car started when i looked back , waiting only for beth and joe to get in when i turned around ."
"the bad guy was standing over the two of them ."
"they were both shot ... . ''"
"she could n't go on , the scene in her mind too horrific ."
"`` shhhh , '' he said and pressed her head down against his shoulder , patting her back and telling her it was going to be okay ."
"but dana knew better ."
"it was n't ever going to be okay ."
"she would be running from this for the rest of her life ."
"there would never be a time when she would n't be looking over her shoulder , worried that someone was about to get her ."
"`` when was the trial ? ''"
"he asked , his hand rubbing her back in an effort to soothe her , reassure her and give her some of his strength ."
"she did so much for him and she 'd been trying to deal with this burden all by herself ."
"she needed his help and she 'd selflessly tried to find a solution without the resources to do much of anything at all ."
"she sniffed and tried to get control of herself ."
"she was making a mess of his shirt and her makeup and probably looking like a weak , useless female in the process ."
"`` there was n't one ."
"i disappeared ."
"i had a job as a waitress in paris for a few months , then i poured drinks in a small town in whales ."
"i kept on going until i found the open position here with your office on the internet for your government ."
"the rest is history , '' she explained , smiling a little lopsided ."
"he watched her for a moment , wondering how she might take his next question ."
"it had to be asked though ."
"`` so if you were to go back and be adequately protected , would there be a trial ?"
"was there enough evidence to convict the murderers ? ''"
"she immediately pulled out of his arms and backed up , worried about what he might be suggesting ."
"`` i ca n't go back ."
"i ca n't do that to any other marshal ."
"they were so brave and i feel like i let them down even though i know that 's not true ."
"they tried hard to protect me and still , everything fell through ."
"no , i ca n't do that to any of them again . ''"
"he kissed her gently , silencing her with the small gesture ."
"`` what about as my wife ? ''"
"dana stilled , horrified at what he 'd just said ."
"`` your wife ? ''"
"she finally gasped and pulled out of his arms ."
"`` yes ."
"as my wife , you 'd be protected twenty-four hours a day , surrounded by body guards who are specially trained to ensure my safety , and that of my family . ''"
"she was already shaking her head ."
"`` i ca n't marry you just to stay safe . ''"
"`` how about because i want you to be with me for the rest of my life , bear my children and drive me absolutely crazy every day ? ''"
"she raised shaking fingers to his cheek , touching the roughness and wishing that kind of dream could really come true ."
"`` no ."
"even you ca n't protect me from those men . ''"
"`` if they were already in prison , they ca n't really hurt you , can they ? ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` i would have to testify before they would be convicted ."
"and that 's not going to happen . ''"
"he sighed and took her hands in his , ensuring that he had her full attention ."
"`` i hate drug dealers ."
"they steal the life out of governments and try to control the people with their poisons ."
"so if getting some of them out of circulation would help , i 'm more than willing to ensure your safety in order to accomplish that ."
"and you will be safe , rest assured of that , my love . ''"
"he put his hands on her shoulders and smiled down into her worried eyes ."
"`` i have some different resources that can be brought to bear that might help . ''"
"she was n't sure she wanted to believe him ."
"he was implying that he had different resources than the us marshals service ?"
"what could he possibly have that could beat their entire system of resources and secrecy ?"
"`` what can you do that the marshals could n't do ? ''"
"he smiled harshly ."
"`` all these cartels have someone deep in the government that is basically ensuring their freedom to move about ."
"as the head of my government , i can freeze oil imports to those countries to pressure their governments , i can freeze bank accounts , move my country 's money out of their government 's banks , which would have a major ripple effect on their economy , adding more pressure ."
"i can have my security detail find the hit men who were hired to eliminate you and ensure that they are ... .neutralized . ''"
"`` you mean kill them ? ''"
"she asked , horrified just at the idea of someone else dying in this crazy situation ."
"he rolled his eyes at her expression , amazed once again at how innocent she seemed to be about certain issues ."
"how could a woman be so intelligent about politics and business , and yet be so concerned with the lives of killers who were trying to kill her first ?"
"`` dana , they were sent to kill you ."
"why would you be worried about their fate ? ''"
"she shrugged and swallowed painfully ."
"`` it is n't right to kill anyone ."
"ca n't you just ... .pressure them to go away ? ''"
"he chuckled ."
"`` i could make it a bit more interesting ."
"how about putting out a contract on anyone who takes up a contract to kill you ? ''"
"`` no ! ''"
"she gasped and shook her head adamantly ."
"`` no more killing !"
"that 's not what this is about ! ''"
"he actually laughed at her horrified expression ."
"`` you 're priceless ."
"you know that the world is a harsh place and yet you 're trying to create a rosy , romantic haze . ''"
"she bristled at his amusement at her outlook on life ."
"she tried to treat it as just another one of those subjects on which their opinions differed but this was a bit more personal ."
"`` i 'm not ."
"i just do n't think that you should dirty your hands in that way . ''"
"he laughed at the idea that she thought his hands were clean ."
"if she thought so , he was n't going to dissuade her from that possibility , no matter how remote ."
"`` okay , how about this ."
"i 'll get a look alike for you to appear in public ."
"that will lure out the hit men ."
"then my security team can capture them as they try and complete their contract ."
"would you be opposed to imprisonment for attempted murder ? ''"
"she laughed and nodded her head , delighted with that solution ."
"`` that sounds much more palatable . ''"
"he shook his head and hugged her ."
"`` you 're going to have to toughen up ."
"the next few months are going to be rough . ''"
"`` are n't i going to just hide here in the palace until the trial ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"but you 're going to be getting ready for a wedding , which will have to be done in the next two weeks ."
"you 're also going to have to meet with lawyers over the phone because no one will be allowed to know where you are ."
"they can prepare you for the trial via web conferencing ."
"you 'll show up for the trial at a time that is convenient for me . ''"
"she cringed at his adamant tone ."
"he did n't realize he was dealing with the united states court systems , which worked at their pace and not someone else 's ."
"`` i do n't think you can do that ."
"i do n't know of anyone who can dictate when a trial is going to happen ."
"i 've only watched the television shows but it always seems as if the defense lawyers have the ability to push out trial dates to suit their own needs . ''"
"hassan laughed and kissed her gently ."
"`` you have no idea what i 'm capable of doing , my love ."
"especially knowing that you might already be carrying my child . ''"
"he let that sink in for a moment ."
"`` it occurred to me a moment ago that i have n't used any protection over the past few days and , since you 're pretty new to this , i doubt you were prepared for the eventuality of sexual encounters either , were you ? ''"
"dana listened to his words but it took a long time for their meaning to sink in ."
"yes , it was entirely possible that she was pregnant ."
"when it finally did , her knees fell out from underneath her and she would have fallen into the floor if hassan had n't been prepared to catch her ."
"`` yep , '' he said as he swung her up into his arms , hugging her close ."
"`` it 's going to be an interesting time coming up . ''"
"epilogue dana ran a finger over the tiny figure in her arms , still amazed that she had a baby boy only ten months after their marriage ."
"`` when your daddy wants to accomplish something , everyone really needs to stay out of the way , '' she whispered ."
"hassan heard her whispered words as he walked into her room ."
"`` does that include you ? ''"
"he teased , stopping by her bed and looking at his new son and gorgeous wife ."
"`` absolutely not ."
"i 'm the exception to the rule . ''"
"`` that you are . ''"
"he bent and kissed his son on the top of his soft , down covered head and kissed his wife , making her sigh with pleasure ."
"`` you certainly were right about bracing myself , '' she mused , thinking back to the last eleven months ."
"she was married a month after their conversation ."
"the trial had taken place two months after that despite all attempts by the defense to stall the situation , presumably so they could locate the prosecution 's star witness and eliminate the threat , the trial still happened on time with all the indicted men ordered to appear with their lawyers ."
"to that effect , there were three hit men who had been captured and were now in prison , serving life sentences for treason in one of hassan 's prisons ."
"trying to execute the queen was a very bad thing to do in hassan 's country ."
"the people had n't appreciated anyone coming in and trying to kill the soon-to-be-born heir either so they 'd rallied around their new queen and had done their best to keep her safe as well ."
"it had been an amazing outpouring of support that dana had n't anticipated ."
"and just twenty-four hours ago , she 'd given birth to an eight pound , three ounce baby boy who had come into the world with a full head of dark , curly hair ."
"just like his handsome father ."
"dana looked up at the man who had given her so much and tried to think of words that were adequate for what she was feeling at the moment ."
"but all she could think about was , `` i love you . ''"
"`` i love you too , '' hassan replied , bending down to kiss her gently while his large hand covered his son 's sweet head ."
"chapter 1 the twig breaking to her left instantly alerted sarila tedrum ."
"her ears were on alert and she sat very still on the beach , trying to hear other sounds ."
"she had been calmly watching the sunset for the past hour ."
"now it was almost completely dark with the smells of the night starting to creep up onto the beach ."
"the only thing she heard for several minutes was the waves crashing against the sand and the wind blowing her long , black hair off her shoulders and back ."
"sarila hurriedly let the sand the sand sift through her fingers then dusted them off as she stood up , intending to head back to her apartment as quickly as possible ."
"she did n't think she was in danger , but she did n't want to push her luck ."
"it was dusk and the beach was basically deserted by now ."
"another noise caught her attention , this time from the right ."
"she bent down , trying to appear casual as she pretended to examine a shell ."
"this second sound changed her feeling of unease to one of severe alarm ."
"she could barely hear anything now because her heartbeat was pounding in her ears and the taste of fear rose in her mouth ."
"she told herself to calm down and concentrate ."
"she could n't let the fear take over or she was already through ."
"sarila took a deep , calming breath and straightened , trying to figure out where the threat was now ."
"as she rose , she saw a shadow off to the right and she took steps in the opposite direction ."
"her shoes were on the steps and her motorcycle was only a few more feet after that ."
"if she could get to her shoes , she could then sprint to her motor cycle and get away ."
"unfortunately the shadow was too close for her to make it to safety ."
"whoever it was , they were very large and they were moving with her , starting to close into a circle around her ."
"`` calm down , '' she told herself ."
"`` you know what to do . ''"
"sarila moved cautiously and made sure to keep the shadow in her line of sight at all times ."
"her muscles tensed in preparation , she looked around and calculated the distance ."
"every nerve in her body was tingling with fear and anticipation of the fight ."
"she worked her way closer to the shadow , hoping she appeared unconcerned and , even better , unaware , of the threat ."
"then , without warning , she reached out quickly , kicking hard with her heel , then spinning around at her waist and grabbing the man 's hand , twisting it quickly behind his back ."
"the man landed with a quiet thud onto the sand and oat grass ."
"`` what do you want ? ''"
"she whispered , careful to not alert the others she 'd heard a little farther off ."
"the man did n't move , nor did he speak to answer her question ."
"she tightened her hold ."
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"she demanded more forcefully ."
"a deep voice laughed softly behind her ."
"`` he will not answer you , nor will he defend himself , princess , '' the voice said ."
"sarila gasped as the voice moved closer ."
"from the current distance , he was only a very large , very intimidating shadow but she knew that voice ."
"it was from her past ."
"a voice she swore she 'd never have to listen to again ."
"and it terrified her now more than the threat she 'd been defending herself against only moments earlier ."
"`` who are you ? ''"
"she called to the approaching shadow , not releasing her hold on the man who was still face down in the sand and weeds ."
"`` ah ! ''"
"the voice said , feigning offense at her words ."
"`` you wound me , sarila ."
"i ca n't believe you do n't remember me ."
"i definitely remember you , '' the voice said , unquestionably closer now ."
"the words were teasing and that only confirmed her worst fears ."
"`` kasar ? ''"
"she gasped , not wanting him to validate that the voice belonged the man she 'd been running from for the past six years ."
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"she asked , wishing her voice did n't sound so scared and pathetic ."
"sarila 's world started spinning ."
"she immediately stood up and stepped back from the man prone in the sand , her feet tripping over his legs but she did n't glance down to find out where safe ground was ."
"kasar was here ."
"that meant nothing was safe anymore ."
"she watched more closely as the large form became larger still as he approached ."
"his size was overwhelming and she was grateful when he stopped several feet away ."
"any closer and she would be craning her neck to look at his face , and that was a feeling she did n't really like to experience ."
"kasar was extremely tall and muscular and she told herself that she did n't like men that large or intimidating ."
"she could see his white teeth in the fading sunlight as he smiled and moved even closer ."
"`` i 've come for you , of course . ''"
"she shook her head , too many awful scenarios screaming through her mind ."
"she tried desperately to hide the fear in her voice but knew it was coming across despite her best efforts ."
"`` why though ?"
"and how did you find me ? ''"
"the man laughed again and stepped closer ."
"his eyes glanced down to the man slowly getting up off the ground ."
"kasar did n't bother to answer her question as he arrogantly looked at her face , noting the long , black hair blowing in the soft breeze , lifting it and causing it to dance around her face and shoulders ."
"sarila 's almond shaped eyes were a light , crystal blue and he could still see their color against her tanned face ."
"they stood out against her high cheekbones that had developed in the six years since she 'd been gone ."
"sarila noted his examination and wondered if he was seeing the gawky , skinny teenager she 'd been before leaving home , or if he was seeing the woman she was today ."
"she 'd had several people tell her she should be modeling so she assumed that they thought she was pretty although she did n't put much stock in appearances normally ."
"when he was done with his arrogant perusal of her features , he looked back at the man flexing his arm and dusting himself off ."
"`` you 've done a number on my body guard ."
"i 'm impressed with your skills at self-defense ."
"i do n't remember martial arts being part of your curriculum . ''"
"sarila glanced away , but only for a moment to see for herself that the man was okay ."
"`` no , there would n't have been a need for me to know how to defend myself back home , would there ?"
"i 'd be surrounded by body guards , just as you are now , '' she said , almost to herself ."
"she watched the body guard for another moment , knowing he was embarrassed that he had been taken down by a female ."
"he stood up stiffly and walked quickly away , taking a new sentry post farther from her and kasar ."
"as soon as he stopped , sarila noticed the other body guards ."
"they were effectively forming a protective perimeter around kasar , and probably herself ."
"suddenly she was self-conscious of her attire ."
"she was only wearing a white bikini , with a gauzy cover up tied loosely around her hips ."
"despite the fact that the bikini was relatively conservative compared to some of the others that might be seen on the beach during the day , there was still more skin showing than there was covered ."
"kasar took that moment to notice her attire as well ."
"his eyebrows shot up as he took in her bikini and voluptuous curves ."
"`` you 've grown up in the past six years , sarila ."
"there is more to be impressed with than your fighting skills . ''"
"`` why are you here ? ''"
"she asked again , crossing her arms over her stomach ."
"she 'd prefer to cover her breasts , but he 'd know how much he affected her if she did that ."
"sarila did n't want to give him any more power than he already had ."
"she could feel the intense magnetic pull toward him ."
"kasar was the ultimate female fantasy ."
"he was incredibly tall with broad shoulders padded with obvious muscles ."
"add to his physical attributes were the ability to charm anyone , male or female and an intelligence that could create humor or shred a person to the core with a few well spoken words ."
"it made him a very powerful leader for his country , but also a dangerous man for her peace of mind ."
"he raised one eyebrow as if the question were ridiculous ."
"`` for you , of course . ''"
"those calmly spoken words terrified her but she was n't going to give in to the fear ."
"she lifted her chin defiantly and ignored the shivers that coursed down her spine ."
"giving in to the fear and anger would only debilitate her and she needed all her wits about her in order to get out of this situation ."
"taking a deep breath , she tried to appear calm and unconcerned ."
"`` how did you find me ? ''"
"his white teeth again flashed in the darkness and he laughed gently at her question ."
"reaching out , he took a lock of hair that was being carried with the wind and wrapped the silky strands around his finger gently ."
"`` do you honestly believe there has been a single moment in the past six years that your location and protection has not been assured , sarila ? ''"
"`` i go by sara now , '' she said defiantly , pulling her hair free of his clasp ."
"then his words hit her ."
"her blue eyes looked at his in the dusk , `` are you telling me that my parents , and you , have known where i have been all this time ? ''"
"she could barely make out his nod in the darkness ."
"`` why does that shock you ? ''"
"sarila sighed , feeling defeated ."
"`` yes ."
"i guess , in retrospect , it should n't but i had hoped that i was actually making my way by myself . ''"
"kasar did n't like the shoulders that drooped on this proud beauty ."
"he looked down at her dejected face and took pity on her pride ."
"`` i do n't believe your parents have helped you in any way , '' he said kindly despite himself ."
"`` but you are the daughter to a sultan ."
"no man in your father 's position , or a mother i suppose , would allow his daughter to roam the world without protection ."
"your father is the head diplomat for abasar and a very powerful man in our kingdom ."
"you could too easily be used as a weapon against your father . ''"
"sarila noted that he did n't say against him as well ."
"after all , she was only betrothed to him ."
"nothing really important , she reminded herself ."
"straightening her shoulders so he could n't see how his words affected her , she brushed her long hair over her shoulder ."
"`` interesting , but irrelevant , '' she said and looked up at him ."
"she could n't see him clearly in the dim light on the beach , but she could see enough to know that he was still one of the most handsome men she 'd ever encountered in her life ."
"he was tall , well over six feet , she assumed , with broad shoulders , slim hips and the jet black hair of his ancestors ."
"she imagined that his dark black eyes were just as piercing as they were the last time she saw him when she was eighteen ."
"`` i can see you 've grown up physically , but have n't matured much over the past six years , '' he said softly ."
"suddenly , all the softness was gone and he turned business-like ."
"`` regardless , we have to talk ."
"please come with me and we 'll discuss an important issue in private . ''"
"he turned and immediately started walking up the beach , fully expecting her to follow his order ."
"sarila braced herself before saying , `` no , thank you . ''"
"kasar stopped dead in his tracks and looked back at her ."
"he was more surprised than angered by her defiance ."
"no one , not even rulers of countries , had ever said no to him before ."
"and yet , this tiny , beautiful woman with a figure made for a man 's touch and soft , scared eyes , was telling him no ."
"he almost smiled at her defiance ."
"he did n't of course ."
"instead , he pierced her with his gaze , daring her to defy him again ."
"`` sarila , please follow me back to the car , '' he repeated in a much softer , but much more menacing tone ."
"`` we have a great many issues to discuss ."
"one of very obvious importance , '' he pointed out and immediately started walking toward the cars again ."
"sarila ignored him as she reached down and pulled on her sneakers , trying to hide her shaking hands ."
"`` no , thank you , kasar . ''"
"he was no longer amused but irritated that he 'd had to come halfway around the world to find her and now she was challenging him as if he were n't her future ruler as well as her betrothed ."
"the idea of her disobedience was outrageous in his mind ."
"he turned around and faced her , suddenly losing patience ."
"`` so you are eager to be wed , are you ? ''"
"he snapped ."
"`` that is fine with me ."
"i 'll have one of my guards put you in the car and we can be finished with this business , '' he said and signaled to the nearest body guard ."
"sarila watched as the body guard immediately moved forward , ready to do the slightest bidding of kasar ."
"she quickly backed up , looking for an escape route as the man with bulging biceps closed in on her ."
"`` no !"
"what are you doing ? ''"
"`` i told you ."
"we must talk ."
"if you do n't wish to talk , then we must finish this business and be done with it . ''"
"`` fine ! ''"
"she yelled when the man was less than five feet away from her ."
"`` if you want to talk , we can go back to my apartment ."
"its close ; only about five blocks away ."
"but we 're not getting married , '' she said with more confidence than she felt as the man stopped in his tracks , waiting for a signal from kasar before proceeding ."
"`` my intentions exactly , '' he snapped and motioned for her to precede him ."
"sarila finished pulling her shoes on , ignoring the resentment that almost choked her ."
"this was one of the reasons she 'd run away six years ago ."
"she 'd been determined that she would not be controlled by a man , especially this one ."
"it was infuriating that he could so easily bend her to his will with simple brute strength and she thought quickly of a way to outmaneuver him ."
"an idea formed in her mind as she saw her motorcycle about a hundred feet away ."
"could she make it ?"
"would he stop her ?"
"she did n't care about the consequences if she did n't make it ."
"she had to try ."
"there was no way she would allow herself to be bound to him ."
"it was a matter of personal pride and emotional survival ."
"having made the decision , she calculated the distance ."
"two more steps , then she 'd run ."
"one , two ... .taking a deep breath , sarila palmed the key to her motorcycle and ran full out , her feet digging into the soft sand as she pushed herself harder and faster to get out of kadar 's reach ."
"her breathing was hard but she did n't look back , afraid that it might slow her down or scare her too much ."
"ignoring the helmet strapped to the back and the yells behind her , she threw her leg over the machine , slid the key into the ignition and gunned the engine ."
"as soon as the motor roared to life , she floored the accelerator , speeding off down the street and kicking up tiny pebbles in her wake ."
"she heard someone yell behind her but she ignored it and sped off , her cover up skirt and her waist length black hair flaring out behind her ."
"she looked back as she turned the corner that would lead to her apartment ."
"kasar was standing on the beach , hands on his hips as he watched her ride away ."
"his body guards were n't as calm though ."
"as she turned the corner , she saw them all running toward the black , menacing suv parked behind the limousine , hurrying to follow in her wake ."
"she figured she had less than five minutes before they caught up with her ."
"she increased the speed and drove the two miles back to her apartment ."
"chapter 2 once in the relative safety of her apartment complex , she sprinted up the stairs , her breathing coming hard and the panic slowly rising as the seconds ticked by ."
"grabbing a duffel bag , she crammed some clothes inside , not even caring what they were ."
"glancing at the clock , she ignored the rest of her clothes , ignoring the toiletries and makeup in her desperate need to escape ."
"she only took another second to grab her purse which contained her wallet , then dashed back out the door ."
"right into a solid brick wall in the form of kasar ."
"`` oomph , '' she said inadvertently as she tried to regain her balance in the hallway ."
"kasar ignored her gasp of fear and stared down at her ."

CHUNK 4:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"after a long moment , he walked forward , forcing her to back up through her door ."
"his eyes looking down at her were furious and a muscle twitched on his jaw as he took a deep breath , obviously striving for patience ."
"`` that was very naughty of you , sarila ."
"why the rush ? ''"
"sarila backed up quickly , worried about being in his arms for two reasons ."
"she was nervous because she 'd run away and he was probably angry about that ."
"she was more terrified of her reaction to his closeness ."
"despite her fear of him , her body reacted to his male scent ."
"it was earthy with just a little spice ."
"it invaded her nose and tempted her , as did the firm muscles underneath her hands ."
"backing farther into the room so she would n't be touching him anymore , she searched for some way to calm him down while at the same time , wracking her brain for another escape route ."
"there was no other alternative in her mind ."
"this was the man she 'd thought herself in love with as a teenager ."
"he was half the reason she 'd run away from her home and family after seeing him kissing another woman in the garden ."
"her jealousy had been so uncontrollable , she 'd run from the garden crying ."
"wringing her hands together and stumbling over furniture as she walked backwards into her apartment , she tried to reason with him or at least appeal to his mercy ."
"`` i ca n't marry you , kasar ."
"please do n't do this ."
"i 'd make you an awful wife , '' she said , walking carefully backwards with him matching her step for step ."
"they were finally inside her apartment and he closed the door quietly ."
"he did n't stop until she backed up against a chair ."
"she tried to slide to the left which would allow her to put more space between their bodies , but he trapped her by placing an arm on either side of her hips ."
"sarila glanced frantically around , desperate to get away from his heat , his intense gaze and , most of all , her overwhelming attraction to the man that even six years of separation had failed to diminish ."
"his eyes searched her face , noting the slight flush on her cheekbones ."
"`` what does a man do to control a woman , sarila ? ''"
"he asked softly ."
"pushing her chin up , she refused to show him how scared she was ."
"`` you do n't !"
"women are not pawns that are on this earth to do what you want them to whenever you snap your fingers ! ''"
"sarila could feel her whole body shaking and leaned farther back ."
"but that position only drew his eyes downward as her breasts thrust forward ."
"`` they are human beings with minds of their own ."
"definitely not yours to control . ''"
"the end was barely a whisper as he moved infinitesimally closer to her ."
"`` you really are lovely , '' he said , his voice husky ."
"`` kasar , this is silly , '' she whispered , trying to ignore the magnetic pull of his body ."
"`` let me go ."
"you do n't want me but i 'm sure there are many women who would love your ... .attentions , '' she said breathlessly ."
"his response was a slow , sensuous smile and he looked down at her breasts ."
"`` a challenge , sarila ? ''"
"he asked , one eyebrow rising as he glanced at her hardened nipples through the thin , white material of her bikini top ."
"`` are you trying to tell me that you are not one of those women who would love my ... attentions ?"
"have you ever known me to back away from a challenge ? ''"
"`` kasar , please do n't do this , '' she begged , hating herself for doing so ."
"`` you know we should n't get married and this is just intimidation on your part . ''"
"`` you think i 'm trying to intimidate you ? ''"
"he asked , amusement in his eyes ."
"`` yes , '' said shakily ."
"one finger slid down her bare arm and she shivered in reaction , goose bumps rising on her skin ."
"`` ah , sarila ."
"you really do n't know me very well , do you ? ''"
"sarila shrunk back from his touch , wishing she could control her reaction to him ."
"`` no ."
"yet another reason we should n't get married , '' she pointed out ."
"he dropped his hand from her arm but his dark eyes did n't leave her face for a moment ."
"`` that 's exactly what i wanted to discuss with you . ''"
"he stood up and backed away a foot , allowing her to stand up and put some space between them ."
"`` now , if you 'll just sit down , we can talk like two rational adults ."
"we have details to go over and i 'm not going to chase you all over the country in order to do that . ''"
"sarila fell onto a chair , the breath coming out of her in a whoosh ."
"the ragged material of the chair was rough on her legs but somehow comforting since she was reminded that she 'd bought this chair herself ."
"if it happened to be at a yard sale , what did that matter ?"
"it had been her own money that she 'd earned herself ."
"nothing in this room had been handed to her and she liked her life that way ."
"she was proud of what she 'd accomplished since leaving the security of the palace in abasar so many years ago ."
"that pride was one thing that supported her , gave her courage in the face of his overwhelming presence ."
"it was n't a lot of courage , but anything was better than the debilitating fear she had been feeling a moment ago ."
"`` i 'm not marrying you , '' she said again , but this time it was a whisper , the fear of being carted off to abasar and forced to marry was overwhelming her and she could n't speak loudly at the moment ."
"kasar took a seat in a high backed chair opposite her and nodded ."
"`` and i 'd rather not marry you ."
"you 're life here in america seems to be completely inappropriate and counter to the culture and values to which we were both brought up . ''"
"his eyes scanned her scantily clad figure as if her attire proved his point , then moved to her face and he watched the blush form on her high cheekbones before he continued ."
"`` but unfortunately , there is a betrothal contract that was signed by my parents and yours over twenty four years ago ."
"add to that the fact that my father is very sick and would like to hand over the throne but is not willing to do that until i am married , well ... we have an issue , do n't we ? ''"
"she stared at him blankly ."
"`` we do ? ''"
"the only words that she heard were that he did n't want to marry her either ."
"sarila did n't like the ache his words created in her chest ."
"that was silly , she told herself ."
"she hated this man and had left the security and love of her family and created an image for herself of a completely unacceptable wife in order to escape marrying him ."
"why was she now upset that he felt the same way ?"
"kasar nodded ."
"`` yes ."
"we both need to extricate ourselves from this contract ."
"i 've spoken to my parents and yours and both are willing to break the contract if we find we are unable to suit each other ."
"since your lifestyle and values are no longer ... '' he paused to run his eyes down her bikini clad figure once again , `` in agreement with my values , then i do n't think we will have a problem convincing our parents that we are unsuited ."
"do n't you agree ? ''"
"sarila was confused ."
"`` you mean , you are n't trying to drag me back to be married ? ''"
"kasar shook his head , `` no ."
"as tempting as you are , and believe me , '' he said , his eyes focusing on her voluptuous breasts , then sliding down to her slim hips through the sheer fabric of her cover up , `` you 're a beautiful woman ."
"but i do n't think a marriage between us would work anymore than you do . ''"
"ignoring his blatant appreciation of her figure , she sat up a little straighter in the chair and crossed her hands over her lap in an effort to appear more cooperative ."
"`` well , that 's more like it ."
"how do we stop it ? ''"
"he raised an eyebrow at her question ."
"`` besides you thinking you can outrun you 're father 's reach ? ''"
"sarila grimaced , `` do n't remind me of that ."
"i thought i 'd been free all this time . ''"
"kasar only smiled at her comment ."
"`` our parents agreed to declare the agreement null and void after we return to abasar together and show them that we are unable to make a marriage work . ''"
"sarila gained hope for the first time in the last half hour ."
"she stood up and started pacing the room , her mind already working on her plan to convince her parents ."
"`` well , that 's not so hard ."
"it 's only a seventeen hour flight to abasar ."
"i could meet you back there in a few weeks and this could all be resolved . ''"
"the look on kadar 's face spoke volumes ."
"`` i do n't think you 're grasping the situation . ''"
"sarila held on to her temper ."
"she would not show her anger despite his condescending attitude ."
"she did n't mind it though ."
"it made him far less attractive when he spoke to her this way ."
"`` well , then how about if you explain the whole situation so i can make an adequate assessment of the options instead of simply assuming that you have told me everything , '' she said , turning to face him with a calm exterior ."
"but inwardly , she was furious ."
"it was only years of hard work that allowed her to hide her anger with him ."
"`` i 'll be taking you back to abasar by ship ."
"it will take approximately two weeks . ''"
"sarila could see that there was more to it ."
"`` and who owns the ship ? ''"
"she asked suspiciously ."
"`` i do . ''"
"`` who else will be on the ship ? ''"
"`` are you saying that you do n't want to be alone with me on the ship ? ''"
"`` i 'm saying that we do n't like each other , so why spend two weeks confined to close quarters with no one else to talk to . ''"
"kasar did n't smile ."
"`` we do n't have a choice ."
"i do n't like it any better than you do . ''"
"sarila shook her head ."
"`` there are always choices . ''"
"`` give me an alternative and i will endeavor to make it work ."
"believe me , i 've tried to argue against this myself ."
"but our parents are adamant that we try . ''"
"sarila did n't like feeling caged in ."
"`` i do n't answer to my parents ."
"i 'm sorry , you 'll have to find an alternative . ''"
"the doorbell rang at that moment , interrupting the anger forming on kadar 's face ."
"sarila looked at the clock on the wall and smiled ."
"`` that would be my date ."
"if you 'll excuse me , '' she said and walked to the door to answer it ."
"`` hi , bobby ! ''"
"sarila said and hugged her friend ."
"`` i 'm running late but if you give me five minutes , i 'll be ready , '' she said ."
"she noticed the wary look in bobby 's eyes when he glanced behind her ."
"she knew that an introduction was unavoidable ."
"`` this is kasar ."
"he 's just leaving , '' she said as an introduction to the two men ."
"without another word , she disappeared behind the only door in the tiny apartment ."
"five minutes later , she reappeared dressed in a figure hugging white shirt , black skirt that flared with her every movement and high heeled black sandals that were little more than straps on her feet ."
"she 'd pulled her hair into a pony tail high on top of her head and applied a small amount of makeup that highlighted her almond shaped eyes , high cheekbones and full lips ."
"`` good night , '' she said to kasar , not surprised to find him still in the apartment ."
"`` not goodnight , my dear , '' kasar said , smiling as if he 'd just learned a secret ."
"`` you 're friend invited me to join you tonight ."
"i 'm afraid i could n't resist one last night of dancing before we leave tomorrow . ''"
"sarila gritted her teeth and counted to ten ."
"`` since we are n't leaving together , you are , then there 's no last night , is there ? ''"
"`` we 'll see , '' was all he would say and followed bobby out of the apartment ."
"bobby was looking from one to the other , obviously confused ."
"only an idiot would be able to ignore the tension between sarila and kasar ."
"they walked down the rickety flight of stairs and sarila started to unstrap the helmet from bobby 's motorcycle ."
"`` we 're not driving tonight , '' bobby said happily ."
"`` kasar has offered the use of his limo for the night ."
"for once , we 'll arrive in style , '' he laughed , delighted with the arrangement ."
"`` everyone will be jealous , wo n't they ? ''"
"he said and dove into the back of the limousine ."
"sarila only glared at kasar before following her friend in ."
"a life growing up in the palace taught her many things and she was n't impressed with the trappings of material wealth ."
"they drove in silence the few blocks to the dance hall where she and bobby had arranged to meet their friends ."
"it was friday night and sarila and a group of ten friends met each week for a night of latin dancing ."
"sarila loved dancing and had been attending these dances for the past two years religiously , forming a tightly knit group of friends who were equally enraptured with the dance scene in los angeles ."
"as soon as the limousine arrived , sarila stepped out and was instantly surrounded by her friends ."
"there were four females tonight and three men ."
"`` where 's dan and jim ? ''"
"sarila asked , counting their numbers and dreading the outcome ."
"they were evenly paired tonight which meant that kasar might try and dance with her ."
"`` never mind those two , tell us about the one behind you sara , '' one of the females said , eyeing kasar up and down his magnificent physique ."
"`` nancy , julie and cindy , this is kasar ."
"kasar , these are my friends ."
"are we ready to go ? ''"
"she asked and headed into the dance hall ahead of the rest of them ."
"the dance hall was actually a basement during the weekdays but on friday night , it was transformed into an inexpensive night club , the walls throbbing with the beat of the latin music ."
"sarila paid for her ticket and waited for the rest of the group to follow ."
"once everyone was inside , sarila smiled at bobby and they immediately moved onto the dance floor ."
"she and bobby danced well together but the group constantly changed partners ."
"sarila was able to avoid pairing up with kasar for most of the evening ."
"latin dancing was fun for sarila because she got to step out of her normal shy self ."
"for a few hours each week , she became someone else ."
"she was able to forget her past and her strict upbringing and just enjoy the music ."
"she and jimmy moved to the beat ."
"she spun and dipped , sashayed along with the music and the guidance of jimmy or whoever her next partner was ."
"the joy of dancing with this group was that they were all friends and dancing with each other meant nothing more than having fun for the next few minutes ."
"in other words , they were safe ."
"within a few hours though , her luck wore out ."
"she was just returning from the bathroom and all the other men were partnered with someone else ."
"kasar was on the sidelines and , if she did n't know better , it looked like he was waiting for her to come back ."
"she smiled politely at him but moved in the opposite direction to get a bottle of water ."
"she desperately wanted to dance again ."
"in fact , the song currently playing was one of her favorites ."
"it was faced paced and a thrill to keep up with the beat ."
"she got her bottle of water and downed half of it before she felt him close to her back ."
"`` come dance with me , '' he said ."
"sarila almost shook her head ."
"but she 'd seen him dancing with the others and wanted to see if he danced as well as it seemed ."
"she stepped into his arms and he immediately spun her , then shifted and spun again ."
"sarila 's face lit up with joy at the dance he was putting her through ."
"she loved the challenge of keeping up with his lead and following through with his moves ."
"he definitely was an expert dancer ."
"the music rushed louder , faster and sarila dipped and swayed , spinning inward , then outward , catching his hand at the last moment before he spun her right back into the circle of his arms , then dropping her back against his strong arms and sliding back up again sensuously ."
"the music reached a crescendo and sarila fell into step , countering each of his moves as it finally whipped to an ending ."
"she found herself plastered against his strong body , looking deeply into his dark , piercing eyes ."
"her breathing was ragged from the work out but she noticed that he was perfectly in control ."
"still holding her against , him he said , `` you 're a good dancer , sarila ."
"yet another skill that i do n't remember being a part of your schooling in abasar . ''"
"his voice was husky and sarila was secretly thrilled that he was affected just as much as she was ."
"unable to hold his gaze , she looked down , then away ."
"`` thank you ."
"and no , dancing was n't permitted six years ago ."
"pity , would n't you say ? ''"
"kasar did n't reply ."
"he simply raised one eyebrow sardonically ."
"sarila moved off to dance with bobby again and ignored the small pang of jealousy when cindy danced beautifully with kasar ."
"she avoided him for the rest of the night and would have continued dancing in order to avoid going home with him if the dance hall had n't closed down for the night ."
"by the time they all said goodbye , sarila was exhausted ."
"she had an early morning class tomorrow and she knew she should get to sleep ."
"her students would n't tolerate any kind of sleepiness ."
"`` you look tired , sarila , '' kasar said and wrapped his arm around her waist ."
"she allowed the casual touch only because she was too tired to avoid it ."
"besides , it felt nice to have someone to lean on tonight ."
"all her friends had left a few minutes ago , including bobby who had gotten a ride home with jimmy ."
"the smooth ride of the limousine combined with the darkness relaxed sarila even more ."
"within moments of the door closing , she was fast asleep , her head leaning on kadar 's shoulder as the limousine drove through the now quiet streets of los angeles toward her apartment ."
"they arrived in her parking lot and sarila did n't move ."
"kasar looked at the sleeping face and wondered what kind of woman she really was ."
"he was n't expecting her , that was for sure ."
"his body had not been prepared for her incredible beauty or the innocence in her eyes ."
"her actions contradicted her expression though ."
"no woman could dance like she did and remain innocent ."
"a man could only take so much enticement before falling victim to her charms ."
"he 'd seen the looks her friends gave her when she was n't looking ."
"he wondered how many of them had tasted her soft lips and experienced her luscious body ."
"kasar ignored the stab of anger that thought provoked ."
"this was not a woman a man should become possessive of ."
"she was beautiful , definitely ."
"but she 'd been living in america for too long for him to expect she was still innocent ."
"no one with her looks and figure could possibly remain so for long ."
"the back door of the limousine opened and he spoke her name softly in an effort to wake her up ."
"but she did n't even stir ."
"with a sigh , he lifted her into his arms and carried her out of the car and up the flight of stairs ."
"he was pleased to note that she curled into his arms , almost purring like a kitten ."
"another guard followed him and unlocked her door ."
"he entered her apartment and easily found her bedroom in the darkness since it was the only other room available ."
"he took off her sandals but went no further ."
"pulling the blanket over her sleeping form , he looked down at her relaxed face in the semi darkness ."
"she really was a beauty , he thought to himself ."
"but it was n't just physical beauty ."
"there was something about her , something he could n't quite define , that attracted him to her ."
"with a sigh , he left the bedroom and walked out of her apartment ."
"he studied the flimsy lock on her door and , in arabic , he ordered the guard to stand sentry at her door to protect her ."
"the man did n't even blink ."
"he simply turned his back to the door and settled in for the night , prepared to stand there all evening until someone came to relieve him in the morning ."
"`` do n't let her see you though , '' kasar said as he went down the stairway , but he was n't sure why ."
"chapter 3 sarila woke the next morning and rolled onto her stomach , enjoying the feeling of the soft blanket on her skin , stretching to ease sore muscles ."
"her eyes fluttered open and she looked out at another bright sunny day ."
"then memories of the previous evening came flooding back to her and she groaned ."
"`` what am i going to do ? ''"
"she whispered , staring at the ceiling ."
"`` the kids ! ''"
"she said suddenly and sat straight up in bed ."
"she glanced over at the clock and noted the time ."
"she was n't as late as she thought but she 'd have to hurry ."
"sarila showered and changed into a pair of jeans and a white tee-shirt ."
"she tucked the shirt into her jeans , slid on some shoes , and then grabbed her bag of instruments ."
"within minutes , she 'd strapped the bag onto her motorcycle and sped off down the street , completely oblivious to the man who had been standing in her hallway and was now phoning in to kasar the information that she was driving away ."
"sarila entered the downtown youth center and smiled at all the children waiting out in the hallway ."
"`` oh , my goodness !"
"am i late or is everyone early ? ''"
"she asked , bending down to accept several hugs from the more gregarious children ."
"once those were done , she searched out the more shy children and cautiously gave each a hug of their own , delighting in the smiles that formed on their faces with the individual attention ."
"once the hugs were finished and greetings given to the ones who were n't ready for a hug , she led the way down the hallway to the small classroom they were allowed to use each saturday ."
"`` is everyone ready ? ''"
"she asked , unlocking the door to the classroom ."
"a resounding `` yes ! ''"
"echoed throughout the room as children rushed into the room that housed a large , round carpet on the floor ."
"each child took their place on the carpet ."
"once all fifteen five year olds were seated , she walked around and gave them an instrument , telling them stories about the sounds the instruments made and why ."
"she made up stories about how a lion was trying to escape from a trap and ground his teeth until he was free , making the rattle sound ."
"she went on and on until all the children had an instrument ."
"`` okay , everyone , let 's stand up and sing ring around the rosy ."
"do we all remember how to sing it ? ''"
"`` yes ! ''"
"they all yelled , getting to their feet eagerly ."
"round and round the children went , giggling and either clapping their hands or clanging their instrument in time to whatever song she called out ."
"sometimes they moved to the center of the circle , sometimes they hopped around on one foot , or maybe they all backed away to the walls , then hurried forward ."
"sarila kept the small children moving and constantly changing the song and rhythm in an effort to keep their attention while they still learned how to count or listen to the beat of the music ."
"she even held up words which she asked them to read ."
"forty five minutes later , all fifteen children clapped at the end of the lesson , carefully handed their instruments back but none really wanted to leave the classroom ."
"one little girl kept looking over sarila 's shoulder ."
"`` ms. sara , who is that ? ''"
"she whispered , her eyes as big as saucers ."
"sarila looked behind her and froze ."
"standing against the wall , his arms crossed over his chest and looking incredibly comfortable and thoroughly amused , was kasar ."
"knowing she could n't transfer her frustrations with him to these children , she smiled politely back at him ."
"without pausing a beat , sarila whispered back , `` his name is kasar ."
"would you like to say hello to mr. kasar in his own language ? ''"
"they all nodded eagerly ."
"`` okay , ladies , line up in a row , gentlemen , please stand behind the ladies ."
"everyone ready ? ''"
"they all got into position and nodded , half of them staring at sarila , the others staring at kasar ."
"`` good morning , kasar , '' she said in perfect arabic ."
"the children slaughtered the language , but kasar politely bowed and repeated the phrase back to the children ."
"`` i heard your music lesson and you all sound wonderful ."
"i hope you grow up to make beautiful music , '' he said , then repeated the words in arabic ."
"the children giggled and whispered to each other ."
"the parents were starting to arrive and the kids ran to their parents , excitedly repeating the phrase and pointing at kasar ."
"several parents stopped to talk with sarila , most of them inquiring if she would be teaching the same class in the fall ."
"`` yes ."
"i 'll definitely be here , '' she assured all of them ."
"one parent came up with her shy little daughter in her arms ."
"emily was one of sarila 's favorites ."
"she showed a great deal of intelligence and enthusiasm but there was a tentativeness - almost a painful shyness that kept holding her back from blossoming ."
"`` emily , i hope you have a wonderful summer with your friends , '' sarila said ."
"`` will you come to my class next year ? ''"
"her mother shook her head , tears forming in her eyes ."
"`` go play with daddy for a moment , emily , '' her mother said and emily shot out of the door into her father 's arms ."
"once her daughter was out of ear shot , the mother turned back to sarila ."
"`` i 'm afraid emily wo n't be able to come back next year , '' she whispered sadly , obviously fighting back tears ."
"`` but i wanted to thank you for helping her this past year ."
"she 's really shown a lot of improvement since taking your class . ''"
"sarila walked the woman over toward the window , not wanting her to be self-conscious around kasar ."
"`` why ca n't she come back next year ? ''"
"sarila asked gently ."
"the woman shrugged ."
"`` we ca n't afford it , '' she said , obviously ashamed ."
"`` but we did n't tell emily that ."
"she loves your class so much ."
"she offered to start working during the summer so she could come back next year . ''"
"the mother was shaking her head ."
"sarila shook her head ."
"`` you bring emily back next year ."
"and do n't worry about the cost of the class . ''"
"`` but ... the payments ... '' `` do n't worry ."
"i do n't do this for the money ."
"i do it for little girls and boys just like emily ."
"i 've seen her blossom ."
"you just bring her back and let me worry about the director , '' sarila said , looking into the woman 's eyes so she knew she was serious ."
"the woman smiled and the tears dropped down onto her cheeks ."
"`` thank you ! ''"
"she said ."
"`` oh , thank you . ''"
"sarila accepted the woman 's hug and watched as she rushed out of the classroom ."
"without looking at kasar , sarila slowly picked up the instruments that were littered over the floor ."
"when she could no longer stand his calm perusal of her actions , she snapped ."
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"she finally asked curtly ."
"why did he have to be so handsome , she wondered , noting his khaki slacks and crisp , white shirt that only accented his muscular arms and shoulders ."
"`` what did you say to her ? ''"
"he asked , but he 'd heard and was curious to see if sarila would repeat her instructions ."
"`` nothing ."
"emily is a very bright little girl ."
"her mother is just worried about her progress . ''"
"kasar walked over and helped pick up the instruments and put them into the bag ."
"`` why is she worried ?"
"i saw her daughter ."
"she was doing everything the other children were doing . ''"
"sarila picked up the tambourine emily had been using , touching the sides and smiling fondly ."
"`` emily did n't speak a word to anyone six months ago ."
"i do n't know why nor do i care ."
"all i know is that she came each saturday , her pretty blue eyes staring at me as the other children sang ."
"she would n't even make a sound with the instruments at first but always held one . ''"
"sarila stood up , her bag of instruments packed away ."
"`` then one day , she sang one song ."
"the next week , she sang two songs ."
"before long , she was singing right along with the others , banging her instrument and smiling as she moved with the group . ''"
"`` the power of music , '' kasar said softly ."
"`` it can heal , '' she nodded ."
"`` that was very generous of you to let her come back next year without paying ."
"i see where you live ."
"you could use the money . ''"
"so he had overheard ?"
"sarila shrugged , ignoring the embarrassment ."
"`` i live in a palace compared to some of these little people , '' she said and lugged the bag over her shoulder ."
"`` anyway , i do n't do it for the money ."
"i do it because it makes me feel better . ''"
"`` i thought you taught kindergartners during the week ."
"do n't you get enough of children ? ''"
"he asked ."
"sarila smiled , `` oh , no !"
"i love them ."
"they heal me and teach me more than i could ever teach them , but i try . ''"
"kasar nodded ."
"`` are you ready to go ? ''"
"`` i have my motorcycle , '' she said ."
"`` i can get home . ''"
"`` come out to lunch with me ."
"we need to talk , '' he said and reached for her arm , assuming that she would immediately do his bidding ."
"`` besides , you 're probably starving since you did n't eat dinner last night and rushed out before grabbing anything for breakfast . ''"
"`` how do you ... '' she was about to ask him how he knew that , but then closed her eyes when he raised an eyebrow at her ."
"`` never mind ."
"i do n't want to know ."
"lunch is fine ."
"i 'm actually starving , '' she said , giving in to his offer of a meal ."
"she let him lead her out of the youth club and into his waiting limousine which was causing a big stir with the teenagers who were hanging out at the basketball court ."
"`` hey , ms. sara !"
"this guy causing you any grief ? ''"
"one of the teenage boys called out , holding the ball under one arm ."
"for half a second she considered telling the teens that he was bothering her ."
"but kasar was n't a fool and he would n't put up with that ."
"besides , it would only get the boys hurt ."
"it was a nice thought though , thinking that someone was out to protect her from someone they considered `` bad '' ."
"`` hey , dave ."
"no , he 's not bothering me ."
"what 's the score ? ''"
"she called back ."
"`` seven up ."
"jumbo 's whining that he 's lost his edge , '' he said , jabbing at the air behind him ."
"`` he has n't lost his edge , '' she called back ."
"`` he probably just lost the tip-off , did n't he ? ''"
"dave nodded and laughed at her insight ."
"`` you got it , ms ."
"sara . ''"
"he turned back to the group of friends ."
"`` hey jumbo , ever think a woman would know you so well ? ''"
"he taunted , then shot the ball toward one of his teammates who quickly dribbled it up for a lay-up , right into the hoop that no longer had a net ."
"while they drove , kasar asked her questions about the music program , the effects it had on the children and the technique behind the teaching ."
"sarila answered all of his questions , amazed that he was so interested and flattered more than she wanted to admit ."
"he was even interested in how she knew the boys ."
"he smiled slightly when she said that she played basketball with them sometimes when they needed a filler ."
"`` why is that so funny ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"`` are n't you a little short to be a basketball player ? ''"
"he asked ."
"sarila blushed as his eyes skimmed down her jean clad figure ."
"`` what i do n't have in height , i more than make up for in technique '' , she defended ."
"as soon as the words were out , she regretted them ."
"her blush intensified as his smile widened ."
"her suggestive comment had n't come out like she 'd meant it but that scoundrel was n't relenting at all ."
"`` you 'll have to show me someday , '' was all he said ."
"thankfully , the limousine pulled up beside the curb at that moment so she did n't need to reply ."
"they arrived at one of the best restaurants in los angeles ."
"despite the fact that she was dressed in jeans and he was in perfectly pressed slacks , they were seated at one of the best tables ."
"sarila ordered a simple sandwich and waited for kasar to start in on his questions ."
"`` so what is your plan to escape from this marriage ? ''"
"he asked instead ."
"sarila was unprepared for his question ."
"`` i do n't know . ''"
"`` well , you 'd better come up with one quickly ."
"because i have obligations that must be attended to ."
"i only have the two weeks starting tomorrow to get this trip out of the way . ''"
"`` tomorrow ? ''"
"she asked , shocked and dismayed at such short notice ."
"`` yes ."
"my boat is docked in the harbor ."
"we could leave tonight if you 'd prefer . ''"
"`` tonight ? ''"
"she asked , sitting up straighter in her chair ."
"she did n't like the confidence in his voice or the fact that he was ready to leave so quickly ."
"`` is something wrong ? ''"
"sarila 's mind was spinning ."
"`` yes ."
"i have obligations as well ."
"i have classes and meetings and ... '' she thought quickly but nothing else came to mind ."
"`` no you do n't , '' he countered ."
"`` you do n't have any classes for three weeks ."
"why do you think i showed up at this time ?"
"school ended two days ago and you do n't have anything until the next semester starts for the summer . ''"
"she had been playing with a fork but it clattered to the table with his words ."
"`` how do you know so much about me ? ''"
"she asked angrily ."
"one eyebrow rose over his dark eyes ."
"`` sarila , do i strike you as the type of person who would leave anything to chance ? ''"
"without waiting for an answer , he continued , `` now , as i see it , you have to put lesson plans together and that 's basically it ."
"you have n't had a vacation since you ran away ."
"do n't try to deny it because i know this for a fact , '' he said before she could interrupt him to deny it ."
"`` why do n't you just spend the next two weeks relaxing in the sunshine , putting your notes together for the next school year and being waited on by my staff ?"
"at the end of two weeks , we meet our parents and request that the contract be voided , then i 'll have my plane fly you back to los angeles , or anywhere else in the world you 'd like to go ."
"you can stop looking over your shoulder for your parents and i can get on with the business of abasar . ''"
"the plan sounded simple enough but she did n't like it ."
"`` i really do n't want to be on a boat with you for the next two weeks ."
"why ca n't i fly out to abasar right before you arrive and we can just explain that it did n't work out ?"
"we do n't have to explain that we were n't together for the past two weeks ."
"what they do n't know , wo n't hurt them . ''"
"kasar leaned back in his chair and looked at her ."
"she could see the disappointment on his face ."
"`` i was told that you 've lost sight of our culture and apparently it is true , '' he said ."
"sarila was stunned ."
"she had been working on that image but she did n't realize she 'd been so successful ."
"she smiled as she took a bite of her sandwich ."
"`` is that so ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` why do you find that amusing ? ''"
"he countered ."
"she shrugged and took another bite ."
"she made him wait while she finished chewing , hoping that it would have the same effect on him as it did on her ."
"`` why do n't you tell me why you think i 'm so counter-cultural , then i 'll tell you why i 'm amused . ''"
"kasar eyes bored into her relaxed face ."
"`` you do n't appear to have any respect for your parents , you apparently sleep around which means you do n't have respect for yourself either ."
"you are definitely not the person i knew as a teenager . ''"
"`` and therefore unworthy to be queen , correct ? ''"
"she said , her eyes hopeful ."
"`` ah ! ''"
"he nodded , `` so that is the game you are playing ?"
"you have tried to become unworthy . ''"
"it was a statement and not a question ."
"he leaned back in his chair while he looked across the table at her face ."
"sarila put more ketchup on her plate and dipped a french fry into it ."
"`` it was a small part of my plan ."
"image is everything , is it not ? ''"
"`` not everything ."
"what 's in a person 's soul is more important , '' he said ."
"sarila did n't like the look of intuitive insight he had on his face at the moment ."
"she smiled at him and laughed , `` kasar , what happened to the man who chased all the women around in college ?"
"please do n't tell me you 've grown into a mature man with all the answers , '' she said , trying to sound confident ."
"kasar smiled ."
"`` is that part of the reason you ran away , little one ?"
"you did n't like me seeing other women ? ''"
"sarila swallowed hard , the fry sticking in her throat ."
"he really was too perceptive ."
"`` do n't be silly , '' she said , waving her hands in dismissal ."
"she then quickly hid them under the table because they were shaking so violently ."
"kasar did n't answer ."
"he simply watched her for a long moment then changed the subject ."
"`` in answer to your original question , no ."
"we ca n't just lie to our parents . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` because lies always come back to haunt the giver ."
"but you can be assured that there is enough space on board the ship that we wo n't often run into each other ."
"you 'll have your own room and we do n't even need to share meals . ''"
"`` no deal . ''"
"even after all that , she knew it would not be a good idea to be on a ship with him for two weeks ."
"`` why not ?"
"you have no work to do for the next three weeks ."
"why not take two of those to relax in the sunshine and bask in the excellent cooking of my chef ? ''"
"he said , winking at her hearty appetite ."
"sarila laughed at his pointed message about her eating ."
"`` i love food and you 're definitely tempting me but i 'm a teacher and we never really have any time off ."
"the next three weeks will be filled with writing up lesson plans for the next school year and coming up with new ideas for crafts , reading up on the latest teaching techniques and millions of other things . ''"
"`` all of which you can do from the ship , '' he pointed out ."
"sarila shook her head in exasperation ."
"`` you do n't take no very well , do you ? ''"
"`` i do n't take no at all , '' he said , smiling again ."
"`` unless i agree with the answer , '' he clarified ."
"sarila needed to find a way to stop him from smiling ."
"each time he did , her stomach filled up with butterflies that fluttered all around ."
"she cleared her throat and looked away ."
"`` well , in this case , you 'll have to ."
"there 's no way i can get all my work done from a ship , no matter how wonderful the cook is . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"he really was persistent ."
"she did n't have a ready reply so she had to think quickly ."
"`` well , there 's art supplies , manuals , books ... lots of things that i 'd need to bring . ''"
"`` i 'll make sure there are plenty of art supplies on board ."
"the books , i 'm sure you could pack in your suitcase ."
"you do n't even need to lift it ."
"i 'll be happy to carry your books for you , '' he said in a teasing tone of voice ."
"the image was appealing ."
"she liked the idea of kasar walking her home from school , paying court to her while carrying her books , his handsome face smiling down at hers as he teased her about one thing or another ."
"just the thought made her shiver in excitement ."
"but the image of all the other women he 'd paid similar attention to in the past quickly came to mind and she shook her head ."
"`` no thanks . ''"
"`` what excuse could you have now ? ''"
"`` none ."
"i just wo n't do it , '' she said stubbornly ."
"`` sarila ... '' `` i go by sara now , '' she interrupted , not wanting to hear his deep voice saying her name ."
"it sent pleasurable tingles up her spine ."
"`` sara , you 're being stubborn just for the sake of arguing . ''"
"he looked at her for a long moment , his face not revealing any of his thoughts or emotions ."
"suddenly , he shook his head and appeared to give up for the moment , `` but i understand . ''"
"she did n't like the way he said that ."
"`` what do you understand ? ''"
"she demanded suspiciously ."
"`` you 're a female , '' he said as if that explained everything ."
"she controlled her impulse to roll her eyes , but just barely ."
"`` yes , i 've noticed ."
"but what does that have to do with our conversation ? ''"
"`` it has everything to do with it ."
"first of all , you are being illogical ."
"you know that you would get much more work done on the ship with minimal distractions , someone to cook and clean for you and all sorts of entertainment available for your pleasure . ''"
"`` but.. '' `` do n't interrupt !"
"i 'm making my points , '' he said abruptly ."
"`` besides the irrational side , you fear being alone with me on board the ship ."
"you remember the crush you had on me when you were younger and are afraid you 'll fall victim to those feelings again . ''"
"sarila was sputtering in her outrage at his last comment ."
"`` crush !"
"i never had a crush on you , '' she lied ."
"`` of all the ego-maniacal , misogynistic , irritating assumptions to make , i ca n't believe you 'd fall into that one , '' she said ."
"he looked her straight in the eye ."
"`` prove me wrong ."
"spend two weeks working on your lesson plans , getting things done , being pampered by my staff and show me and our parents that you are a woman who knows her mind and wo n't be tempted . ''"
"she was no longer outraged , she was furiously angry ."
"`` fine ! ''"
"she replied ."
"`` i 'll go on your silly little boat just to prove that this was one of the worst ideas our parents ever came up with , '' she said and stood up to leave ."
"`` what time does the boat leave ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"kasar stood up as well , ignoring his half finished lunch and his immediate desire to touch the woman who was practically shaking with her fury ."
"he kept his face from showing his amusement as he replied , `` in three hours . ''"
"he snapped his fingers to one of the body guards who was sitting at a table close by ."
"the man immediately paid for their meal while kasar followed behind the furious woman , delighted that she was falling into his trap ."
"despite his fascination with her incredible figure and fiery temper , he would n't touch her over the next two weeks ."
"he watched the way her long , muscular legs carried her quickly out of the restaurant and her lovely breasts pushed against the material of her shirt ."
"he was only kidding about her crush but if it worked , he was willing to use the challenge just so they could both move on with their lives ."
"he did n't want to marry but he knew he would have to eventually ."
"it was better to get this betrothal contract out of the way now , so when he did find someone worthy , he would be free to marry her instead ."
"he definitely would n't mind if they had long legs like this little spitfire did , he thought as he climbed into the back of the limousine behind her ."
"and he definitely liked her derriere ."
"he snapped an order in arabic to one of his body guards who immediately moved off to catch a cab ."
"`` that was expedient , '' she said in english ."
"he had ordered the man to go buy as many art supplies as possible for the trip and meet them at the dock ."
"`` i 'm glad you remember your mother tongue , '' he said sincerely ."
"`` perhaps you have n't moved too far away from your heritage as you 'd like to pretend ? ''"
"`` no , what you see is what you get , '' she replied , then wished she 'd not uttered the words because his eyes skimmed her jean clad figure , stopping momentarily on her breasts ."
"`` promise ? ''"
"he said , raising one eyebrow ."
"`` not in that way , '' she said , feigning disgust but she crossed her arms over her chest to hide her body 's reaction to his look ."
"he laughed softly , obviously having seen it despite her attempts ."
"they drove to her apartment and he left her to pack , letting her know that he 'd be back in two hours to pick her up again ."
"she noticed that one of the body guards escorted her up the stairs and , once she was standing in front of her door , she saw the shiny new locks that had replaced her previously flimsy one ."
"the man behind her handed her the key then stepped back to stand sentry outside her door ."
"sarila smiled gratefully at the man , reminding herself that she did n't have any issues with him , just his employer ."
"she walked into her apartment and closed the door , knowing he would n't leave no matter how much she assured him that she was n't in any danger from intruders , nor would she attempt to run away again ."
"chapter 4 as soon as her door was closed behind her , she started packing and reviewing the past hour ."
"with a sinking heart , she realized that she 'd been manipulated into this trip ."
"she 'd let her temper get the better of her , something she 'd seen happen to her mother on several occasions ."
"sarila had witnessed it many times while she was growing up and had promised herself that she would never allow a man to manipulate her emotions in that way ."
"sarila considered not going , but his accusations were too close for comfort ."
"she did n't want him to think she was afraid of him ."
"so she packed more of her clothes , several bathing suits and her makeup ."
"she filled another bag with books and magazines she 'd been saving up for her mini vacation ."
"with a sigh , she looked around and tried to see if there was anything else she might need ."
"nothing popped out at her so she walked out onto her tiny balcony and watched the people as they milled about on the street below ."
"she wondered why she felt like her life was suddenly on the verge of a major turning point ."
"she told herself she should n't really think like that ."
"she should consider this only a two week vacation ."
"and at the end , she would see her estranged parents after an absence of six years ."
"her heart ached to see her parents again ."
"she missed them terribly ."
"sarila had considered going home on several occasions ."
"one time , she 'd even gone so far as to purchase a plane ticket home ."
"but she never got on the plane ."
"memories of the reasons she 'd left surfaced and she banished the idea each time it came up ."
"sarila was determined to not end up in a frustrating marriage to a man who could barely endure her and married her simply because he 'd been ordered to do so by his parents and a legal document ."
"she also did n't want to marry someone from her own culture ."
"she reasoned that perhaps the reason why her parents fought so much was because her father was so domineering ."
"he had a great deal of responsibility within the abasar government and sometimes , it seemed that he took his anger out on her mother ."
"she knew her parents loved each other desperately but she did n't understand why they fought so much ."
"it was as if her father knew exactly which buttons to push in order to get a reaction from her mother ."
"sarila did n't want to spend her life waiting for the next fight ."
"she preferred her peaceful life to one of volatility and turmoil ."
"enter : kasar ."
"there was no denying her fascination with the man ."
"he was incredibly handsome but it was more ."
"he was a prince who commanded obedience and respect not only because of his title , but because of his personality and his charisma ."
"that was probably why sarila had never found any other man to her liking ."
"how could she move on to another man when she 'd experienced the charm and overwhelming personality of kasar ?"
"she smiled as she remembered being at the palace several times in her youth ."
"her father often brought them to the palace when he would be on extended travel for security so she and her mother had basically lived there some years ."
"she 'd been told about her betrothal when she was about five years old but had n't seen kasar until a few years later ."
"her instant fascination with him had made her parents ecstatic ."
"sarila sat out on the balcony , evaluating her life and the upcoming two weeks with both dread and excitement ."
"two weeks aboard a ship with a man she disliked intellectually and personally , but physically found fascinating ."
"if she just continued to remind herself of his offensive personality , she knew she could ignore the physical attraction she had for him ."
"it would n't matter what she thought about him , she had to stay away from him ."
"he did n't want her anymore than she wanted him , so it probably would n't be an issue ."
"sarila watched with resignation as the limousine drove up to her apartment building ."
"she did n't get up to meet him ."
"instead , she watched as he got out of the car and spoke to one of his body guards ."
"she could n't hear the words , but the man immediately rushed off in another direction ."
"she wondered what kasar had requested , but knew he 'd never tell her unless he wanted her to know ."
"kasar then walked confidently into the apartment building as if it were all part of his kingdom ."
"she was amazed by the amount of confidence the man exuded ."
"she wished she could be like that , she thought to herself ."
"but a moment later , a knock sounded on her door and she pushed all her yearnings away ."
"`` hello again , '' she said as she opened the door ."
"`` good afternoon , sara ."
"are you all ready ? ''"
"he asked politely ."
"sarila picked up her two duffle bags and slung them over her shoulder ."
"`` i 'm ready , '' she said and moved past him down the stairs ."
"he tried to take her bags , but she just shook her head ."
"`` i 'm fine ."
"if i ca n't carry it , i should n't pack it , '' she said and moved quickly down the stairs ."
"it was a short drive from her apartment to the pier ."
"before she could retrieve her bags from the trunk , a sailor ran off a ship , grabbed her luggage and then disappeared again ."
"`` is that your boat ? ''"
"sarila asked , staring at a vessel that could be defined as a cruise ship because of its enormous size ."
"`` yes ."
"is something wrong ? ''"
"he asked , staring at her open mouthed awe ."
"sarila closed her mouth quickly ."
"`` no , '' she snapped ."
"`` you were right ."
"we probably wo n't even be able to find each other on that thing , '' she said ."
"kasar chuckled ."
"`` it is n't that big ."
"we might run into each other once or twice . ''"
"sarila examined the ship through her sunglasses ."
"`` is that a helicopter landing site ? ''"
"she said , pointing to a large platform with a capital `` h '' on it ."
"`` yes , '' he confirmed ."
"`` okay then ."
"let 's go , '' she said ."
"sarila had grown up with wealthy parents but she 'd forgotten all the wonderful little things wealth could buy ."
"she was shown to a beautiful stateroom decorated in subtle shades of white and cream ."
"the carpeting was so thick , her feet sank into the fibers , softening her steps ."
"the bed was made up in white silk sheets with a cream satin cover and a soft , fluffy blanket covering the end ."
"the steward had delivered her luggage but was now gone ."
"so sarila unpacked her clothes and examined the rest of the room ."
"there was a fully stocked bar and a refrigerator with all sorts of gourmet cheeses and chocolates , fruits and specialty drinks ."
"on the bottom shelf were several bottles of water ."
"within moments , she felt the engines stir to life and the ship started moving ."
"she considered staying in her room and reading , but the urge to go up on deck and watch the shoreline disappear was too tempting ."
"she grabbed a bottle of water , a book and left the room ."
"she eventually found her way up on deck and found a seat ."
"a servant appeared only moments after she settled down in a deck chair ."
"`` dinner will be in the main dining room in one hour , your highness , '' he said , bowing slightly ."
"`` can i get you a cocktail ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` no ."
"thank you , '' she said ."
"`` and please call me sara , '' she pleaded , not wanting to hear her title anymore than was necessary ."
"`` as you wish , your highness , '' he said and bowed out of the area ."
"sarila sighed and opened her book , drank her water and basically felt her body relaxing as the shoreline eased away ."
"it really was a nice ship , she thought to herself an hour later when she found the main dining room ."
"she knew she should probably dress up for dinner , but she did n't feel like it and wanted to irritate kasar , who probably was expecting a formal meal ."
"she was surprised to find that she was dining alone ."
"a servant appeared with a note from kasar as soon as she stepped into the dining room ."
"he explained that he would be unable to join her for dinner due to an important conference call that came in this afternoon and has not stopped yet ."
"the pattern followed the same routine for the next two days but sarila did n't mind ."
"she worked hard at her lesson plans ."
"the solitude of the ship genuinely helped her concentrate ."
"she had taken over one of the salons , spreading her lesson plans out along a large table which allowed her to see each month 's ideas much more clearly ."
"there were ten months in the school year with an average of four and a half weeks each ."
"the school mandated a certain curriculum be taught but the creativity behind getting the concepts into the children 's heads was pretty much left up to the teachers ."
"sarila used monthly themes and formed the lessons around those themes ."
"one month it was animal kingdom and she would have the children make different animals from various craft materials ."
"the animals almost always `` spoke '' in the sounds the kids were studying for the month and each animal had a certain number of syllables or spots that aided in counting ."
"another month it was parts of the body and sarila did the same concepts with sounds , reading and math , adding an element of fun to the learning process ."
"writing was her favorite time of the day ."
"she used the regular tools but also some different ways to get the children to practice their writing skills ."
"some days , the children would crowd around a plastic sheet with mounds of shaving cream ."
"each student was encouraged to write their words in the shaving cream , then smooth it out and write other words ."
"sand also worked well as did other bubble making materials ."
"the third afternoon , sarila was working in the salon , her hair pinned up behind her head and she wore a pair of shorts and a simple tee shirt with no shoes ."
"she was laughing as she wrote down monthly ideas for crafts ."
"when she was done , she stood up and surveyed her months , smiling as if she had just won the nobel peace prize ."
"`` you look extraordinarily satisfied , '' a deep voice said from the doorway ."
"sarila spun around and faced the man that had been in the back of her mind for the past three days ."
"`` hello ."
"coming out to the light ? ''"
"she said , then turned back to her table and considered other ideas ."
"she needed to focus on something other than the man 's long legs shown off with his navy blue shorts and white tee shirt that hugged his biceps , showing off a flat , muscular stomach ."
"`` coming out to apologize to you for ignoring you ."
"i really am sorry , '' he said and stopped when he looked down at all she 'd done ."
"`` what 's all this ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` this , '' she said , throwing her arms out over her table of ideas , `` is next year 's kindergarten curriculum ."
"what do you think ? ''"
"kasar looked around with an odd smile on his face ."
"`` i do n't get it , '' he said , picking up a giraffe 's face that was attached to a brown lunch bag ."
"`` what does it do ? ''"
"sarila took the bag out of his hands and stuck her hand inside ."
"`` this is jerry giraffe ."
"and he will only laugh at the j sound ."
"during circle time i 'll read a story ."
"each time the children hear a `` j '' sound , they need to make their giraffe laugh , like this , '' she said and opened the giraffe 's `` mouth '' to show him the giraffe 's tongue and tonsils she 'd cut out ."
"`` whatever happened to just writing down the words and memorizing them ? ''"
"he asked , shaking his head in disbelief ."
"`` memorization has its place ."
"it is definitely a skill that helps in brain development , but do n't you think the children will remember a laughing giraffe over a tedious writing exercise ? ''"
"kasar smiled broadly ."
"`` yes . ''"
"`` so this is more effective , '' she said and put the giraffe back on the february pile of activities ."
"`` how many activities do you have to come up with ? ''"
"`` about ten for each day of the week , '' she said , examining her calendar for gaps ."
"`` ten activities ? ''"
"he asked , the shock coming through in his tone ."
"`` of course ."
"kindergartners are only about five or six years old ."
"they do n't have very good attention spans . ''"
"`` that seems like a lot of work , '' he said , and lifted a lamb made of black construction paper and cotton balls ."
"`` it 's worth it , '' she smiled ."
"`` that is for recognizing the letter a ."
"each child needs to come up with a sentence with the sound of a in it . ''"
"`` fascinating , '' he said ."
"`` how many hours does it take you to come up with all of this stuff ? ''"
"sarila looked at her watch ."
"`` i 've been doing it for eight hours so far ."
"it 's two o'clock now so i still have at least eight more hours to work . ''"
"`` do n't you take a break ? ''"
"`` do you ? ''"
"she asked , not bothering to look at him since she knew the answer ."
"evidently , he was a workaholic and had spent just as much time in his office as she had creating lesson plans for the past few days ."
"`` yes . ''"
"`` when ? ''"
"she laughed , still shifting her papers and filling in ideas on post it notes ."
"`` how about now ? ''"
"`` i guess now could be considered a break , '' she shrugged ."
"`` no , i meant , how about if you take a break with me ?"
"you look tired . ''"
"`` oh , '' she said and stopped shifting and focused her attention on him ."
"for one , heart stopping moment , the idea of taking a break with him , laughing and talking with him sounded lovely ."
"but then she remembered what was at stake and her libido slowed down ."
"`` no , thank you , '' she finally said and put her head back down so she could focus on her lessons again ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` i have too much to do , '' she said ."
"`` come on , '' he replied and put an arm around her waist ."
"`` we 'll just take a short spin around the ocean and then come back once we 've gotten a little fresh air . ''"
"he took her hand and led her out of the salon ."
"`` what do you mean , a spin around the ocean ?"
"is n't that what we 're doing ? ''"
"she asked , trying to hide the shock that went through her system when his large , warm hand held hers ."
"`` not really , '' he said and pulled her down two flights of stairs to the back of the boat ."
"`` hop in , '' he said as he led her to a speed boat that was lifted out of the water by a wench ."
"he lifted a phone and spoke into it , `` we 're using the speedboat , '' was all he said before placing the receiver back in its cradle ."
"within moments , the ship slowed to a stop and the speedboat lowered into the water ."
"with the two of them inside , kasar maneuvered the boat backwards and out of its docking station right out into the wide open space of the ocean ."
"sarila took a seat in the back of the boat and leaned back , allowing the ocean spray to cool her hot cheeks ."
"she watched as kasar drove the boat at top speed , turning and spinning , not really going any way but meandering around the ocean ."
"from this vantage point , sarila drank heavily of the sight of kasar driving ."
"she was able to look to her heart 's delight at his broad , muscular shoulders and back which were now outlined in detail as the wind whipped his white linen shirt against his body ."
"his bottom was firm and she even liked the way he stood with his legs braced apart as if he were ready to take on an enemy instead of just the ocean wind ."
"within moments , the ship was only a small dot on the horizon but kasar did n't stop ."
"he continued driving around , enjoying the feel of the boat and its power ."
"sarila did n't talk not because she would n't be heard over the roar of the engine or the sound of the wind , but because she was just too relaxed to speak ."
"the wind pulled her hair off her face and the sun beamed down onto her cheeks and shoulders ."
"after about an hour , he stopped the engines and let the boat float ."
"kasar turned around and sat down next to her , not really talking , but just enjoying the silence ."
"they stayed like that for several minutes , both of them enjoying the peace and solitude of the ocean ."
"finally , he turned to her ."
"`` what made you run away from abasar ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she looked at him out of the corner of her eye ."
"`` thinking of the overwhelming responsibilities of your obligations ? ''"
"she teased ."
"`` no , '' he said seriously ."
"`` i 've accepted my life and the obligations that come with my life ."
"i was just wondering why you chose to run away instead of facing them . ''"
"sarila did n't detect anger or derision in his tone , just curiosity ."
"`` women do n't have as much power as men in abasar ."
"so it is n't the same ."
"imagine being subjected to a life you did n't choose but that was handed to you at birth ."
"but in this role , you do n't have any rights or freedoms , you are completely at the mercy of another human being . ''"
"`` is that how you see marriage ?"
"as a prison ? ''"
"she considered his words ."
"`` yes ."
"i suppose i do . ''"
"`` and you think it will be better with an american husband ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"i hope so . ''"
"`` then why have n't you married ? ''"
"they were now treading on dangerous ground ."
"she chose flippancy over honesty ."
"`` it is n't from lack of trying , '' she teased ."
"that was n't really a lie ."
"she had seriously looked around , desperately searching for a man who could match kasar in both strength of character and charm but without the irritating qualities ."
"and she also wanted someone who would be faithful and love her the same way she was willing to love a man ."
"his dark eyes surveyed her soft features ."
"`` you 're a very beautiful woman ."
"either you are n't trying seriously , or the american men are blind . ''"
"sarila smiled , warmed by the compliment ."
"`` so you 're only looking for superficial beauty in your wife ?"
"i pity the both of you . ''"
"`` no , i did n't say that ."
"i want my wife to be strong and intelligent , kind and giving ."
"someone who will make me whole . ''"
"that was an interesting statement ."
"she raised her eyebrows as she looked over at him ."
"`` kasar , that sounds surprisingly modern ."
"where did that idea come from ? ''"
"`` being around many unintelligent women , '' he laughed ."
"`` and school ."
"there are many strong women at princeton and i found them fascinating . ''"
"`` well , i wish you luck '' she said and put her face up to the sunshine ."
"`` so far , i have n't found many men with the qualities i prefer in a husband . ''"
"`` what are the qualities you 'd prefer ? ''"
"she shrugged ."
"`` what any woman wants , i suppose ."
"strength , confidence , intelligence , someone i can come to and talk through my problems and he wo n't dictate the answers but will listen and help me work through to a solution ."
"is n't that what everyone needs ?"
"some just do n't find it in their spouse . ''"
"`` are you saying you 'd cheat on your husband if he did n't have those qualities ? ''"
"he asked sharply ."
"`` absolutely not ."
"i believe in fidelity and i wo n't stand for anything less in my spouse ."
"one reason why you wo n't do for a husband , '' she said and smiled to soften her words ."
"`` you love women too much from what i remember . ''"
"`` true , '' he said , not sure he would give up women but knowing he would never hurt his wife ."
"she shrugged , wishing he had n't confirmed her suspicions regarding his fidelity to one woman ."
"`` so i wo n't settle for less in a man than what i 'm willing to give in return . ''"
"he surveyed her pretty face with eyes that were shooting the challenge to him ."
"`` any man would be a fool to cheat on you , '' he said , and sarila heard the sincerity in his voice ."
"`` thank you , '' she said , grateful for his comment ."
"`` so what changes have happened in abasar over the past few years ? ''"
"changing the subject to something a little less personal ."
"`` we have fifty women graduating from medical school this year , '' he said proudly ."
"`` there are many new roads that are increasing trade throughout the region ."
"we 've heavily increased the infrastructure and local elections are monitored by observers to ensure fair voting . ''"
"`` what about new industries ?"
"any growth there ? ''"
"`` we 're working on building internal industry slowly through inventions versus foreign investors ."
"we have the revenues to increase organically ."
"we do n't want a lot of foreign companies coming in who might take advantage of our people , work them to death , then leave a gaping hole or building in our infrastructure . ''"
"`` how are you doing that ?"
"it would seem like you 'd need to increase the education in order to see that kind of mental change . ''"
"`` we 've more than doubled the education budget over the past five years ."
"we now have at least one school in every village . ''"
"sarila 's mouth dropped open in shock ."
"`` how was that accomplished so quickly ? ''"
"`` a lot of hard work and major arguing , '' he said , smiling into the sunshine ."
"sarila was quiet as she watched his face for a moment ."
"`` you did most of the arguing , did n't you ? ''"
"she asked in a moment of clarity ."
"`` i was part of the effort , '' he nodded ."
"`` but i had a lot of help . ''"
"`` who could wield more power than you ? ''"
"she asked ."
"kasar looked at her , squinting into the light ."
"`` holding power is n't necessarily the correct question ."
"you should know that having lived within the walls of the palace so often during your childhood ."
"besides , you 'd be surprised who supports education , '' he said ."
"`` but it is time to head back to the ship , '' he said and stood up ."
"gunning the engine , he drove back to the ship in quick time ."
"sarila considered his mysterious response and wondered what he had been referring to ."
"could he care for someone that lived within the palace ?"
"could that person have convinced him that he should support upgrading the country 's educational system and schools ?"
"could this stranger be a teacher ?"
"or just a palace worker ?"
"someone who was a servant perhaps ?"
"it would have to be someone pretty who had caught his eye ."
"the idea made her stomach clench in anger and what she wished she could deny but was obviously jealousy ."
"`` i can see your mind is working overtime over there , '' he said , glancing toward her as he maneuvered the boat through the ocean waves ."
"`` what could possibly bring you more color to those lovely cheeks and sparks to your eyes more than the wind and sun ? ''"
"sarila hated that he was so observant ."
"`` i do n't know what you 're talking about . ''"
"kasar chuckled ."
"`` you 're so transparent , sarila . ''"
"he steered the boat toward the ship with absolute confidence ."
"`` care to share your thoughts ?"
"or are they about me and therefore un-share-able ? ''"
"sarila blushed , making the color in her cheeks even deeper but she did n't know that ."
"`` is n't that a little self-absorbed of you ?"
"perhaps the world does n't revolve around you ? ''"
"sarila knew that was an unfair accusation but she was still reeling from the idea of him loving and being persuaded by someone else ."
"not that she wanted the position or the influence , she told herself ."
"she just wanted him to respect her enough so he would n't fall in love with someone else while still betrothed to her ."
"she was lashing out and could n't stop herself ."
"`` do n't worry , little one , '' he said with a wink ."
"`` your mother is a very convincing woman when she fights for a cause , '' he explained ."
"sarila 's anger dissipated entirely ."
"`` my mother was the person who argued to change the educational standards ? ''"
"he glanced back at her , his smile broad and too arrogant ."
"`` of course ."
"who else within the palace has as much influence besides my own mother ? ''"
"sarila had been trapped !"
"he 'd known exactly where her mind would take her and had let her go there , only to find herself having to look like a fool ."
"`` that was cheating , '' she said , crossing her arms over her chest and glaring at him ."
"`` yes , very unchivalrous of me , was n't it ?"
"but you ca n't deny me the small pleasures around you ."
"you 're so easily angered . ''"
"did he think she was only angry ?"
"thank goodness he did n't know how jealous she 'd become in such a short amount of time ."
"just the idea had sent her mind reeling ."
"`` kasar , you 're a very complicated man , '' she said , looking at him with different eyes ."
"there was more respect all of a sudden ."
"good grief , she thought to herself , shaking her head and tearing her eyes off his muscular form and forcing her eyes to focus on the horizon and the ship coming closer to them ."
"how could one man make her feel so many different things so quickly ?"
"anger , jealousy , indignation and now respect ?"
"was she losing her mind ?"
"possibly , she accepted ."
"he docked the boat just as easily as he had taken it down ."
"he climbed out , then turned to offer her a hand as she stepped onto the main platform ."
"unfortunately , the ship rocked at that point and sarila fell into kadar 's strong arms , her soft body grazing against his strong one ."
"she stood up quickly , her face flaming as she realized how her breasts had flattened against his hard chest ."
"she suspected that he could see her body 's reaction through the thin tee-shirt she was wearing ."
"`` excuse me , '' she said , righted her footing , then quickly stepped away ."
"`` my pleasure , '' he said from behind her ."
"`` fall into me any day . ''"
"`` i 'd better get back to work , '' she said and preceded him up the stairs , painfully conscious of his eyes on her body as she walked slowly up the stairs ."
"she could actually feel his gaze on her body ."
"knowing he was looking , she kept her walk as straight and careful as possible , not wanting to entice him in any way ."
"that was too dangerous , she told herself , keeping even a small sway from her gait ."
"kasar watched her walk up the stairs , liking the way she 'd felt in his arms ."
"she was all soft and feminine yet more delicate than she appeared ."
"and he really liked her legs , he thought as she took the stairs two at a time ."
"he also liked her reaction to his touch ."
"he 'd never experienced it himself , but he recognized when a woman was fighting an internal battle against the chemistry ."
"and he suspected there was a lot of chemistry between the two of them ."
"mildly irritated that his body was so interested in her , he eased his mind with the knowledge that she was just as intensely aware of him ."
"what harm could there be in two people satisfying themselves with each other , he considered , walking up the stairs after her , smelling her unique perfume that had trailed behind her ."
"it was soft and feminine , not harsh or overtly sexual ."
"he liked that ."
"damnit , there really was too much to like about the woman ."
"he was going to have to do something about it , he told himself as his body stirred to hardness just thinking about her wearing that interesting perfume , and nothing else ."
"he pushed the idea away that started to form in his mind ."
"he could n't have an affair with sarila ."
"despite what she had done with other men in the past , he would not dishonor her family by enjoying a physical relationship with her ."
"besides , that would only complicate extricating themselves from the betrothal ."
"if his parents or hers heard even the smallest rumor of any kind of physical relationship between the two of them , he would be honor bound to fulfill the terms of the betrothal contract ."
"but would that be such an awful thing ?"
"to be married to sarila ... to have her grow with his child , be in his bed every night ?"
"his body hardened even more ."
"but he forced himself to push that idea away ."
"he did n't want another man 's woman ."
"and according to sarila 's manner and challenging looks , there had been many of them ."
"kasar was just sexist enough to want to be the only man in his wife 's life ."
"although he had n't abstained , he wanted his wife to know only him ."
"since that was n't the case , he knew he would have to keep his hands , and every other body part , away from the lovely , sexy sarila ."
"moving into his cabin , he headed straight for his shower , stripping off his clothes as he went ."
"once inside the blue and white marble bathroom , he turned on the shower , blasting the cold water down onto his overheated flesh , grimacing as the water struck his body ."
"despite his determination to avoid a physical relationship with sarila , he found himself entering the dining room two hours later , freshly showered and shaved ."
"he did n't bother to dress in formal attire , knowing that she usually just grabbed her meals and went back to work ."
"`` good evening , '' he said when she walked into the dining room ."
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"she asked , so startled to see him she almost did n't come into the room when she spotted him ."
"he looked breathtaking in pressed black slacks and a white , collarless shirt ."
"the white against his dark skin made him look swarthy and very appealing ."
"he walked casually over to the bar and poured himself a glass of dark liquid ."
"`` i took a break so i could join you for dinner ."
"do you object ? ''"
"`` um ... no , '' she said ."
"but in reality , she did mind ."
"she minded a great deal , she thought as she watched his strong , hands with long , sexy fingers pour the liquid into a glass ."
"she minded his very presence that had her mind moving in directions that were better not entered ."
"such as what it would be like to be held in his strong arms like he had earlier this afternoon , but for a kiss rather than just to catch her from falling ."
"`` what can i get you to drink ? ''"
"he asked ."
"kadar 's look was almost a challenge , as if he was asking her for something more than just a beverage ."
"she tried to think quickly but standing face to face with his tall , muscular form , her mind just would n't function quickly ."
"well , it would but her thoughts were mostly about how sexy he looked and how she wanted to touch his arms and feel if they were really as rock hard as they appeared ."
"she had a lot of trouble answering his question ."
"how does a woman think about drinks when there were those bulging biceps to look at ?"
"shaking her head , she looked away from him and was finally able to form a thought other than how much she wanted him to walk over to her and kiss her ."
"`` wine is fine , '' she said quickly , her eyes dropping from his intense , knowing gaze ."
"thankfully he turned away to survey the contents of the bar and she watched in fascination as he reached behind him and pulled out a bottle of red wine ."
"his hands were strong with long , lean fingers that seemed to caress the bottle and glass as he poured the rich liquid ."
"she watched as he walked closer to her ."
"he was standing right next to her , looking down into her worried face ."
"`` what 's wrong , sarila ?"
"do i make you nervous ? ''"
"he asked softly ."
"he handed her the glass of wine , his eyes never leaving her face ."
"she accepted the glass carefully , not wanting to touch his fingers with hers ."
"while she picked up the offered glass , she smiled slightly and then took a deep breath , which only gave her a strong whiff of his aftershave and made her heart start fluttering again ."
"`` no , '' she said and took a step back in order to walk around him ."
"`` not at all , '' she was able to say when she had a little more breathing space ."
"trying to fill the tense silence , she grasped at the only conversation piece she could think of , even though it came out a little lame ."
"`` where 's the buffet ? ''"
"she asked , looking around the dining room ."
"usually there was a small buffet of delicious dishes waiting for her selection ."
"he walked over to the dining room table ."
"`` i asked the chef to serve a real meal tonight , '' he said and pulled out a chair for her ."
"`` i asked for seafood ."
"i hope you like it , '' he said and pushed her chair in for her as soon as she sat down ."
"it was one of her favorite foods but she did n't tell him that ."
"`` that 's fine , '' she replied , looking down at her plate ."
"he took the seat right next to hers at the head of the table and although he was several feet away , in her mind , it was too close ."
"the next ship was too close at this particular moment ."
"she blushed as she glanced up briefly to watch him and he caught her eye again , smiling slightly in her direction ."
"servants appeared at that moment and delivered covered plates that were placed in front of each of them ."
"their covers were lifted and the smell of fresh seafood covered in a creamy sauce wafted to her nose ."
"`` oh , my ! ''"
"she said , eagerly taking a taste ."
"`` this is wonderful . ''"
"`` it is one of my favorite meals , '' kasar replied but he did n't move to try it himself ."
"she stopped with the second bite midway to her mouth ."
"glancing over at him , she became intensely self-conscious with him watching her , his black gaze never leaving her face and a slight smile curing his sexy lips ."
"`` is something wrong ? ''"
"she finally asked ."
"`` not at all , '' he said , smiling more broadly ."
"`` i 'm impressed that you eat ."
"so many women of my acquaintance eat only tiny amounts , focusing on their weight and not on their enjoyment . ''"
"sarila rolled her eyes ."
"`` i 'm sure you 're a regular observer of that behavior . ''"
"`` everyone has to eat , sarila . ''"
"she shrugged her shoulder slightly ."
"`` i was referring to your observations of enjoyment instead of their eating habits . ''"
"as soon as the words were out of her mouth , she regretted them ."
"the amusement that had been lurking in his eyes broke out into full blown laughter ."
"when his laughter died down , he looked over at her , watching the blush steal into her cheeks ."
"`` jealous ? ''"
"she stiffened under his perceptive gaze ."
"`` not at all ."
"i just do n't want to be part of the crowd ."
"i try to be unique , '' she said and took another bite of the scrumptious food ."
"kasar laughed again but started eating as well ."
"`` i can guarantee that you are incredibly unique , '' he explained as he picked up his fork ."
"after the awkward beginning , it turned out that he was a wonderful dinner companion ."
"he could discuss just about any subject knowledgably and eased the tension throughout the meal ."
"she could n't remember laughing so much during a meal between two people ."
"`` what are you doing after dinner ? ''"
"he asked when the dessert arrived ."
"it was a flaming crepe with a delicious orange sauce ."
"the waiter served the sweet with cognac and left them alone ."
"`` i 've been catching up on my reading the past few nights . ''"
"she hated to admit to being so boring , but he probably knew exactly what she did during every moment of the day , if he bothered to ask one of the servants ."
"she did n't flatter herself that he had asked though ."
"`` what are you reading ? ''"
"`` journals and different kinds of articles ."
"nothing you 'd be interested in , '' she said ."
"`` you 'd be surprised at what i 'm interested in , sarila . ''"
"`` well , this is pretty dry stuff , '' she said awkwardly ."
"`` would you like to take a break this evening and try something different ? ''"
"she was instantly wary ."
"`` what did you have in mind ? ''"
"he was amused at the caution that entered her eyes ."
"`` how about a game of chess ? ''"
"she liked the idea instantly but hid her enthusiasm ."
"`` are you any good ? ''"
"`` i rarely have time to play lately ."
"so i do n't think you 'll find me too much of a challenge , '' he said , his face not revealing anything ."
"`` well , i guess i could try to play the game ."
"i have n't played since ... '' she stopped ."
"she had n't played since she left home but that subject would only bring up irritating conversations so she did n't continue ."
"`` since you left home ? ''"
"he finished the sentence for her ."
"`` i know you and your father used to play often ."
"why have n't you played since then ? ''"
"she shrugged and looked out the window at the sun that was just about to slip over the horizon ."
"`` i never found anyone who liked chess ."
"it is n't a casual game . ''"
"`` are you any good ? ''"
"she looked at his face ."
"`` no , '' she lied , trying to keep her face straight ."
"`` i 'll be nice , '' he said and stood up ."
"he led her through the dining area to a very comfortable living room with an elaborate chess set in one corner ."
"he pulled out an overstuffed chair on one side of the table ."
"`` care to make it interesting ? ''"
"he asked , sitting down across from her ."
"sarila laughed ."
"`` the fact that you are even making the suggestion means that you are good enough to win ."
"so no ."
"i do n't want to bet on the outcome . ''"
"`` ah , so you 're not very good ."
"well , then , this should n't take long ."
"you may have the first move , '' he said and looked down at the board ."
"`` i 'm adequate , '' she said back at him , moving her pawn forward two spaces ."
"she knew he was raising her hackles and tried to back down , but when he threw a challenge out , she seemed incapable of ignoring it ."
"`` obviously not very confident of your skills , '' he countered and moved one of his own pawns ."
"`` i could take you , '' she snapped , struggling to control her temper and moved another pawn into position ."
"she 'd considered herself good at developing her pieces , setting them up in the opening phase for strength and challenge ."
"she settled her knight into place and then considered the best place for her bishops ."
"`` better not risk it , '' he said , shaking his head as he countered her move ."
"`` what an arrogant man you are , '' sarila said ."
"`` you 're on ."
"what 's the bet ? ''"
"he was silent while he considered his next move ."
"but once he 'd moved a bishop , he looked across at her and said , `` three days . ''"
"`` three days ?"
"what does that mean ? ''"
"she watched the board and knew that he was moving to the fifth space without developing his bishops ."
"always a risky move ."
"the idea settled in her mind , allowing her to gain confidence in her strategy ."
"she settled her queen 's knight and waited for his move ."
"moving his castle into play , he glanced up at her to explain ."
"`` if i win , you give your parents three days when we return to abasar ."
"that will still allow you five days to get back to california and settled before your classes begin . ''"
"sarila was shocked to find herself considering his bet ."
"she hated gambling but knew that , even if she lost the bet , he was only asking her to spend more time with her parents in abasar ."
"that would n't be too hard ."
"she missed her parents desperately ."
"the only reason she had n't contacted them in so long was because she did n't want to feel the guilt over her departure or to be pressured into abiding by the terms of the betrothal contract ."
"`` fine , '' she said and moved another pawn , trying to free up her more powerful players ."
"`` and if i win , you donate money for an expanded music program for the youth center , scholarships included . ''"
"`` done , '' he said ."
"`` and your rook is in danger . ''"
"sarila ignored his warning and continued with her own method , placing a pawn to attack which meant he had to move his knight out of play ."
"they played quietly for a long time , both of them losing only a few pieces but neither one really making any headway ."
"`` do you have a boyfriend ? ''"
"he asked , breaking the silence that had paralleled the game so far ."
"she lost her train of thought and glanced up quickly at his face ."
"but he was concentrating on the chess table ."
"`` no ."
"do you have a girlfriend ?"
"or i guess in your case it would more aptly be called a mistress . ''"
"`` no ."
"i do not have a mistress , '' he said and took one of her rooks ."
"`` would you like to volunteer for the position ? ''"
"he asked , placing her piece on the side of the table nearest him ."
"sarila could n't think for a long moment ."
"the option was too tempting ."
"her fingers shook when she moved her queen ."
"`` no , thank you ."
"i do n't think i have the requisite qualities , '' she said and sat back in her chair , trying to get her nerves under control ."
"`` oh , i would n't say that , '' he said and looked up at her breasts ."
"`` i 'm a very generous lover , '' he replied ."
"she glared at him for a long moment ."
"then she realized he was teasing her and she sighed heavily ."
"he 'd done it again and this time , she 'd lost one valuable piece and her concentration ."
"well , she was n't going to let him get away with that ."
"leaning forward again , she touched her finger to her lips as she 'd seen actresses do in the movies ."
"`` i 'm sure you 're a terrific lover ."
"you probably have very sterling qualities . ''"
"kasar instantly noticed her movement and his eyes narrowed as he watched her move her piece ."
"`` want me to demonstrate them for you ? ''"
"`` no ."
"i 'm just not interested , '' she said and yawned loudly , stretching her arms over her head and arching her back slightly ."
"she looked back down at the board and concentrated all her attention on her next three moves ."
"she was feeling deliciously evil by bringing attention to her female anatomy in that way ."
"but since he 'd started it , she did n't feel the least bit ashamed ."
"besides , the kids would get a new music program out of this so it was all for the good ."
"it worked ."
"after two moves , she captured his queen ."
"but the play was n't over yet ."
"he rattled off suggestions designed to either anger her because of her feminist views or to rattle her sexually ."
"she would then lose her concentration and another player ."
"turning the tables on him was exciting , she thought , rubbing her finger along her lower lip or flipping her hair over her shoulder ."
"she 'd never experienced that kind of power , and it became heady ."
"after two hours of playing , they reached a stalemate ."
"`` how about pool ? ''"
"he suggested after surveying the board and accepting that neither was going to win ."
"`` pool ? ''"
"she asked , wide eyed ."
"`` of course ."
"there '' s a wager on the table ."
"we have to finalize the prize . ''"
"`` you 're talking billiards , correct ?"
"not the water sport . ''"
"`` absolutely ."
"but if you 're afraid of that one as well , i understand ."
"women have an inferior perception of spatial reasoning so it might be best if we just lay off the gambling . ''"
"`` you 're on , '' she snapped , but this was n't out of anger ."
"she understood his game this time and she was n't falling victim to it twice ."
"`` where 's the table ? ''"
"`` in the game room , of course , '' he said ."
"`` of course , '' she rolled her eyes ."
"`` i ca n't imagine why i thought it was in the kitchen . ''"
"she stood and started walking out of the room ."
"she passed by him , still shaking her head when she felt a swat on her bottom ."
"spinning around , she glared at him ."
"`` what was that for ? ''"
"`` that , '' he said , towering over her , `` was for the sarcasm , my dear . ''"
"`` you 'll pay for that , '' she warned ."
"`` i hope so , '' he said softly as he watched her walk out of the room ."
"in the hallway , she stopped and looked both ways ."
"`` okay , i 'm stumped ."
"it took me about a half hour just to find the dining room my first day ."
"i have n't come across a game room yet so you 'll have to lead the way . ''"
"`` will you always be so ready to let me lead you ? ''"
"he asked suggestively ."
"but he did n't wait for an answer ."
"he turned to the right and led her down yet another hallway ."
"in front of a set of double doors , he opened them up to reveal a large room with a king size pool table , pin ball machines , a ping pong table and ice hockey machine as well as several other games that she could n't identify ."
"`` do you want to set up or break ? ''"
"he asked , handing her a pool stick ."
"`` i 'll break , '' she answered ."
"kasar shuffled the balls and put them into the triangle , then lifted it off for her break ."
"`` same wager ? ''"
"she asked , walking around to analyze the balls ."
"`` absolutely . ''"
"`` want to up the ante in any way ? ''"
"she asked and bent down to expertly shoot ."
"with a decisive shot , she sent all the balls spinning off in different directions , two of them going into pockets ."
"`` let me determine your skill before i ante up anything more . ''"
"she went around the table and skillfully put one ball after another into the pockets ."
"when all the balls were gone , she turned back to him triumphantly and smiled ."
"`` i guess the youth center is getting a boost to its musical curriculum , huh ? ''"
"she said and started to put the pool stick away ."
"`` double or nothing , '' he challenged and did n't wait for her reply ."
"`` this time , make it an additional day plus you come back for the next holiday . ''"
"she considered his offer for a moment ."
"`` increase it to dance classes and two teachers and you have a deal , '' she said ."
"kasar moved closer , trapping her between his body in front and the pool table in back ."
"`` deal ."
"if i win , i want a kiss in addition to the three days and holiday , '' he said and walked around to break the balls ."
"sarila could n't respond ."
"he took her silence for agreement and went about dropping all the balls into the pockets , but even more difficult , he had to call the balls before they dropped or it was her turn ."
"he never missed a shot ."
"he expertly racked up all the balls , took off the triangle then turned to her , raising one eyebrow as he waited for her to break ."
"sarila pursed her lips and walked over to the pool table ."
"this had to be good , she thought to herself ."
"she kept the vision of kasar kissing her out of her mind and focused instead on the kids that would benefit from the extra dance classes ."
"she bit her lower lip in concentration and slammed her pool stick at the ball ."
"the balls scattered over the table and one dropped into a pocket ."
"`` not as good as the last time ."
"i 'm hopeful , '' he said ."
"sarila ignored him and concentrated on her next shot ."
"`` three ball in the left pocket , '' she declared , then bent over , took aim and fired ."
"the ball sunk into the pocket ."
"`` two ball in the middle , '' she said ."
"again the ball fell into the pocket ."
"by the fourth ball , she was n't so lucky ."
"the ball bounced harmlessly off the side ."
"all the color drained out of her face as she watched the ball roll back to the center of the table ."
"`` hmm ... interesting shot , '' he said ."
"he walked around the table , lined up his shot , then sunk the ball ."
"he pocketed three more balls before he missed ."
"sarila looked around at the table ."
"none of the shots were very easy ."
"his balls were in front of each of her balls ."
"she 'd either have to shoot across the table or bounce it off the side and into the pockets and the angles were tricky ."
"`` does n't look promising , does it ? ''"
"he said , walking closer to her as he watched the table ."
"`` what will you do ? ''"
"he asked his confidence was starting to undermine her own but she refused to back down ."
"taking a deep breath , she surveyed the table again and considered her next move ."
"seeing a shot , she smiled ."
"`` stand back , '' she said determinedly and walked around the table , resolved to win this game ."
"she bent down , took aim and fired ."
"thankfully , the ball went into the pocket but it almost did n't ."
"sarila held her breath as the ball hesitated at the edge of the pocket , stood still for a moment , then finally fell in ."
"he raised one eyebrow as he looked up at her , noting the anxious expression on her face with an amused one of his own ."
"`` very close ."
"please proceed , '' he said and positioned himself opposite her again ."
"watching him lean against a wooden column , watching as she considered her next shot , she became rattled ."
"his gaze was too intense and all-knowing for her peace of mind ."
"`` i 'd rather you not stand in front of me , '' she said , not able to look him in the eyes at this point ."
"`` where would you like me to stand ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` any view is advantageous as you 're lining up your shot , believe me , '' he said , a sensuous smile on his face ."
"sarila stopped viewing the table and looked at him ."
"he was not looking at her face initially ."
"he was too busy surveying her figure as she prepared to bend over the table ."
"her reaction was instantaneous ."
"her face flushed and her breathing became erratic ."
"it amazed her that he did n't even have to touch her and her body reacted as if it were on fire ."
"his eyes slowly lifted to hers and one eyebrow raised questioningly ."
"`` are you going to shoot ? ''"
"sarila took a cleansing breath and tried to focus ."
"lining up , she calculated the angle , pictured the shot in her mind , then took aim ."
"her luck was not with her this time ."
"the shot was too difficult as the ball bounced against the side and rolled over to nudge his ball ."
"`` i guess that means it is my turn , '' he said and pushed himself away from the stool he 'd been leaning against ."
"he looked around , chose his shot , lined it up and sunk the ball ."
"over and over again , he sunk one ball after another ."
"sarila stared at the table feeling a little nauseous ."
"soon , the table was cleared ."
"kasar put his pool stick down on the table , took hers and laid it across his ."
"without a word , he put his hands on her hips and pulled her closer to his body ."
"`` i 've been wanting to do this for days , '' he said softly , moments before his head bent low , his lips touched hers , gently rubbing against hers as he tested their softness and texture ."
"`` put your arms around me , '' he said ."
"sarila 's body was rubber ."
"she could n't have obeyed him in her nervousness so he simply lifted her arms and placed them on his chest , right where he wanted them ."
"he then dipped his head again toward hers ."
"the second touch of his lips was devastating ."
"it was as if he were reaching into her soul and lighting her on fire ."
"the pressure was demanding but not hard and she responded against her will ."
"her mind kept telling her that he 'd already had his one kiss which was all the bet had been for ."
"but as his lips brushed against hers and his tongue delved into her mouth , all thought of stopping went out the window ."
"her body took over where her mind had ceased to function ."
"she felt him pull her body harder against his and she felt his muscles spring to life as her fingers started to explore ."
"her hands crept up his shoulders and her body stretched to feel more of him against her soft curves ."
"kasar moved his hands from her waist to her back and then downward , pulling her hips against his , showing her how much the kiss was affecting him as well ."
"sarila moaned softly , unsure of what to do next ."
"she opened her mouth and allowed his tongue to explore , moving hers as well , loving the texture of his lips against hers and the feel of his rock hard body against hers ."
"his hands slipped under her shirt and the flames only shot higher when skin touched already sensitive skin ."
"sarila felt as if her body was going to ignite and she pushed against his shoulders , scared of the feelings that he was able to stir within her ."
"it took several minutes before he understood that she was asking him to stop ."
"finally , her body language broke through and he stepped back , raking his fingers through his hair ."
"they were both breathing heavily when he stopped and took a step away ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i did n't mean for that to get so out of hand . ''"
"she tried to be casual about the experience but in truth , she 'd never felt those things ."
"she 'd been kissed before ."
"but never had her body reacted to the point that she did n't know where she was or what was happening ."
"there had only been mild curiosity in the past ."
"it had never gone beyond kissing though ."
"and kissing kasar was an experience unto itself ."
"he was sex personified , she thought ."
"`` i lost the bet ."
"i 'll stay the extra three days , '' she said and walked quickly out of the game room ."
"it took her several tries , but she eventually found her stateroom ."
"she threw herself onto the bed and stared at the ceiling , wondering why she 'd had such a strong reaction to kasar ."
"what was it about the man that made her quiver with just the slightest touch ?"
"she 'd met attractive men before , even muscular ones although none that were both like kasar ."
"but beyond that , she knew there was something more to kasar than just looks and muscles , although that combination alone probably attracted more than his fair share of women ."
"it was his aura , his confidence ."
"he had a power that emanated from him and made her stomach flutter , her muscles lose their strength and her body crave to touch and be touched by him ."
"pulling the satin coverlet over her now shivering body , she rolled over and closed her eyes , hoping to rid herself of the memory of kadar 's kiss through sleep ."
"despite what he assumed about her sexual prowess with men , she had actually lived a very sheltered life ."
"she 'd run away from home partly because she did n't want to see kasar flirting , and possibly more , with the other women he brought to the palace and partly because she did n't want to marry him and have the same kind of marriage her parents had ."
"her parents fought ."
"she knew they loved but their fights were loud and uncompromising ."
"they never fought around her but she had heard them on several nights when she 'd snuck down into the lower levels of their house for various reasons ."
"they never hid their anger from her , only the yelling ."
"she knew they did n't hide their loving either , which they thought made up for the anger ."
"but it did n't ."
"not in sarila 's mind ."
"she wanted so much more from her future husband ."
"most of all , she wanted peace and stability , respect ."
"so she 'd left , knowing that staying would only mean marriage to kasar who was too much like her father in both his opinions and upbringing ."
"she thought that kasar would be just as temperamental as her father and she did n't want that ."
"but as she 'd gone into the world on her own , she 'd found that it was very hard to find a man who measured up to kasar in looks and confidence ."
"after meeting , dating and talking to many men , she accepted that none had ever measured up to kadar 's brand of masculinity which is what she 'd grown up with and what she now accepted was what she was attracted to in a man ."
"with all her dates , she 'd never even been tempted beyond a simple goodnight kiss at the end of a date ."
"most men had n't been able to deal with that and had moved on to other women ."
"a few had stuck around to get to know her , but they 'd ended up as friends and had never crossed over to lover ."
"so now sarila was unsure what to do with the feelings that were still tormenting her body from kadar 's simple kiss ."
"sarila tossed and turned in her bed that night , the silk sheets causing her to think of kadar 's touch and his mouth against her skin or his fingers caressing her body in ways she 'd never wanted any other man to do ."
"finally , toward dawn she fell into a deep , exhausted sleep but dreamt of him chasing her , her hair blocking her view as she looked backwards ."
"chapter 6 sarila did n't sleep well that night ."
"she tossed and turned , wishing her body would calm down and allow her the escape of sleep ."
"but her mind kept going over the kiss and her body reacted each time she thought about his hands and his mouth , the tenderness followed by the demands ."
"it had been exhilarating and terrifying ."
"she finally fell asleep but it was n't deep or peaceful ."
"she woke up almost as tired as when she 'd gone to bed ."
"the following morning , she pulled on a bikini intending to take her books and notes out to the pool in order to work ."
"she was tired of being cooped up in the salon and thought a break might be a good change ."
"as soon as she stepped out of her stateroom , she ran into a brick wall ."
"`` good morning , '' kasar said , holding her steady while she found her balance ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' she said , flustered all over again with his warm hands holding her shoulders ."
"`` no need to apologize ."
"i was just coming to see if you 'd eaten breakfast . ''"
"she could n't hold his dark gaze so she stared at the buttons on his chest instead ."
"`` no ."
"i was just on my way up . ''"
"`` good ."
"i 'll join you unless you object , '' he said ."
"`` that 's fine , '' she said unsteadily , her hungry , tired eyes taking in his muscular body dressed in casual shorts and polo shirt ."
"what was she supposed to say ?"
"please stay away from me or i 'm likely to jump your bones and find out what all the fuss has been about with my friends ?"
"she walked ahead of him and tried to come up with some light banter to break the silence ."
"but nothing came to mind ."
"his large , intimidating body was too close behind her , making all her thoughts fly away ."
"they reached the breakfast room and each of them took a plate and filled it with their breakfast food ."
"`` why do n't you sit down outside and i 'll bring you a cup of coffee , '' he suggested ."
"`` thank you , '' she said shyly ."
"she went out onto the deck and sat in the shade , liking the way the breeze rustled her hair ."
"kasar came out a moment later with a cup ."
"`` half a cup of coffee and the rest cream and sugar , right ? ''"
"he said ."
"`` that sounds great , '' she said , not even slightly embarrassed that her coffee was more of a dessert than a caffeine fix ."
"`` where did you run off to last night ? ''"
"he asked , taking the seat opposite , his tone deceptively quiet as he looked her directly in the eyes , calmly waiting for her reply as if he had all the time in the world ."
"sarila could n't look him in the eye ."
"the memory of how his kiss had affected her was too new in her mind ."
"in fact , her body still had n't recovered from the effects ."
"she could n't look at his face for fear of her eyes lingering on his lips , her mind wondering if she 'd remembered the feelings correctly and wanting him to kiss her again , just to be sure she had n't imagined everything ."
"`` i just went back to my room to read , '' she lied , her voice barely above a whisper ."
"`` and hide ? ''"
"she brushed a non-existent crumb from her lap ."
"`` why do you say that ? ''"
"she asked , trying to appear casual ."
"he did n't answer her immediately ."
"he looked at her curiously as he sipped his coffee ."
"`` you 're not really as free thinking and liberated as you 'd like everyone to believe , are you ? ''"
"`` i 'm not sure i understand your meaning , '' she said and took a bite of the fruit on her plate ."
"unfortunately , she glanced up at him and noticed his perceptive gaze resting on her face ."
"the fruit tasted and felt like sawdust in her mouth and she had to concentrate to chew and swallow the delicate melon ."
"after considering her features for another moment , he responded , `` when i first ran into you , i noticed your belly button ring , your skimpy bathing suit and the freedom you felt walking along the beach dressed like that ."
"i came to the conclusion that you were more unconventional ."
"but i 'm getting the impression that you 're not really ... '' `` yes , i am , '' she interrupted forcefully , fearful that he was going down a path she did n't want him to stray toward ."
"she could n't let him think she was a virgin ."
"that would mean she might be considered wife material ."
"that was an impression she had to avoid at all costs ."
"`` just because i did n't want to sleep with you , does n't mean i do n't ... '' she hesitated , trying to say the right words ."
"her mind had created an image that she could n't afford to let him ponder ."
"he smiled slightly ."
"`` you ca n't even say it , can you ? ''"
"`` say what ? ''"
"`` make love , sleep around , have sex , whatever the term and i 'm sure there are several that are more indecent , '' he said ."
"sarila did n't like how close to the truth he was getting ."
"she shrugged and leaned back in her chair , taking a careful sip of coffee ."
"`` think what you like ."
"if you want to believe i 'm an innocent , then i 'm not going to stop you . ''"
"kasar did n't say anything else on that subject ."
"he was silent as he watched her , his mind obviously sorting through various impressions ."
"finally he said , `` would you like to go jet skiing later today ?"
"i noticed how much you liked the speed of the boat but a jet ski might be more to your liking ."
"you can drive your own . ''"
"she did n't like him being considerate ."
"it made her heart melt a little more toward him when he was n't being antagonistic and domineering ."
"but the idea appealed to her too much ."
"she could n't hide her curiosity at the idea ."
"`` jet skis ?"
"you have one on board ? ''"
"`` there are two ."
"we 'll plan on doing it this afternoon , '' he said and stood up , taking his cup with him but leaving his breakfast on the table ."
"`` i 'll see you in a few hours , '' he said and walked away ."
"sarila changed her mind about reading out in the sunshine ."
"after her interlude with kasar , her mind and body were in overdrive ."
"so instead of reading , she worked happily until lunch time on her lesson plans ."
"her creative juices were flying high today for some reason ."
"kasar seemed to be able to infuse her with anger , laughter and creativity all within one meeting , she thought ."
"`` are you ready ? ''"
"kasar said , walking into the salon where she was working ."
"he did n't stop walking until he was right next to her , his body almost touching hers ."
"he surveyed her work , smiling at some of the ideas she 'd added in the past few hours ."
"looking at her work , she nodded satisfactorily ."
"`` yes ."
"i 'm ready , '' she replied and stretched her aching back and shoulders ."
"`` sore ? ''"
"he asked , and put his hands on her shoulders , rubbing the tense muscles and knots that had formed while she bent over her work ."
"`` oh , that feels good , '' she said , closing her eyes and enjoying the magic of his hands ."
"`` i think i was bent over the table for too long today , '' she said , rolling her head forward ."
"after a few minutes , his touch completely relaxed her ."
"when she was more relaxed , his hands moved from being relaxing , to exciting ."
"the touch eased a little but his hands still massaged the muscles , just with a different emphasis ."
"`` what were you working on ? ''"
"he asked , too near to her ear ."
"her heartbeat accelerated and she had to jerk slightly away ."
"`` the same thing as yesterday , '' she said quickly and grabbed a clip to hold back her hair ."
"`` i thought you were going to take me out on the jet skis , '' she said , hoping to break the tension ."
"his hands quickly dropped from her shoulders to his sides ."
"`` so we were , '' he said easily ."
"`` unless you 'd rather talk about why you are nervous suddenly , '' he countered , turning her around so he could look down into her eyes ."
"`` do i make you nervous ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` not at all , '' she said and tried to walk away ."
"but his strong hands stopped her and turned her back to face him ."
"`` i think you are lying ."
"and it would be an interesting investigation to find out why you are lying , '' he said , his mouth a firm line but his eyes were searching , curious ."
"taking a deep breath and ducking under his arms , she quickly shuffled some papers ."
"`` kasar , you 're supposed to be a magnificent ruler with a perceptive nature but i think you are grasping at air here ."
"i promise you , there 's nothing here but my intent to avoid a marriage contract that simply wo n't work between the two of us , '' she said ."
"kasar was silent for so long , she finally stopped her busy work and glanced back at him ."
"he was standing there , watching her with a small smile on his face and a knowing look in his eyes ."
"he walked over to where she stood and touched her cheek ."
"`` so i do n't affect you in any way , is that what you are trying to convince me of ? ''"
"his finger slipped lower , so it was covering the frantic beat of her heart revealed in the pulse at the base of her throat ."
"`` or are you trying to convince yourself ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` kasar ... '' she started , about to take a step backwards , out of his reach , but he stopped her with a firm but gentle hand on her waist ."
"`` do n't lie to me , sarila ."
"you can lie to yourself all you want for whatever reason you want ."
"but do n't think i 'm unable to determine the truth of what is going on between us ."
"you feel it and it scares you ."
"i 'm not sure why , though . ''"
"she tried to laugh off his statement but the sound came out sounding more like a hiccup ."
"`` you 're imagining things , '' she said , shaking her head and glancing down at the floor ."
"`` if you do n't want to go jet skiing , then that is fine with me ."
"i have plenty of work to do here , '' she said and turned back to the table containing her lesson plans ."
"`` come , '' he said and stepped back himself ."
"`` i promised you an afternoon of jet skiing and that is exactly what we 'll do ."
"there is more time to explore other ... .ideas later on , '' he said and took her small hand in his , guiding her back down to the bottom of the ship where the jet skis were located ."
"they were actually in the same place as the motor boat but she had n't seen them the previous day , being too absorbed in kasar at that time ."
"they spent the afternoon jetting around on the ocean , zig zagging through the ocean 's flat surface ."
"sarila loved the speed and the freedom the jet ski allowed and she challenged kasar to a race , which he easily won but it was so much fun to race around as if there were no cares or concerns in the world ."
"just the sun and the freedom to go any direction her mind wanted to take her ."
"chapter 7 sarila watched as kasar entered the dining room ."
"he always seemed to take her breath away lately , she thought ."
"tonight was no exception ."
"he was wearing tan slacks with a black shirt tonight , the dark color making him look a little more dangerous ."
"she was n't sure how he could be more dangerous ."
"he was already a threat to her peace of mind , no matter what he was wearing ."
"`` good evening , '' kasar said , his eyes roving over her figure approvingly ."
"`` i like the dress , '' he said ."
"`` what 's the occasion ? ''"
"`` no occasion , '' she said , looking down at her pretty , yellow sundress ."
"`` i just decided to change out of the shorts for a change ."
"and since you were so considerate to fill up the closet with these lovely dresses , i decided to pamper myself . ''"
"`` i 'm glad you like them . ''"
"his eyes showed his appreciation for the smooth line of her back , the gentle flare of her hips ."
"`` they look lovely on you . ''"
"he pulled the chair out at the dining room table for her ."
"`` one question though , '' she said as she pulled the napkin down onto her lap ."
"`` were they leftovers ? ''"
"`` would that bother you if they were ? ''"
"he asked , taking the seat at the head of the table as usual ."
"she forced her shoulders to relax into a casual shrug and flipped her hair back over her shoulder ."
"`` i do n't think so , '' she lied , wishing she really could relax ."
"he placed his napkin on his lap , sat back in the chair and looked at her for a moment before answering ."
"`` well , i can assure you that no , they are not leftovers from a previous guest ."
"along with the art supplies , i asked that clothes be purchased for you as well ."
"it looks like you do n't make a great deal of money , i was offering you a vacation , it just made sense to offer you clothes in which to enjoy that vacation if you were so inclined . ''"
"his eyes roved over her figure , the gleam of male appreciation evident in his look ."
"`` i can see that i guessed your size correctly . ''"
"she blushed slightly with the understanding that he had figured out her size ."
"`` i guess that is why all the tags were still on the clothes , '' she said , delighted with his thoughtfulness ."
"`` but i can assure you i make a decent income . ''"
"she sat down in the chair he pulled out for her , then watched in appreciation as the muscles flexed in his arms as he took his own seat ."
"kasar did n't mention that he knew exactly what her salary was ."
"`` why is your apartment so sparsely furnished then ? ''"
"he asked , nodding to the servants to indicate that it was okay to serve the food ."
"`` oh , i just spend my money in a different way ."
"i do n't really spend much time in my apartment ."
"why should i waste money furnishing it ? ''"
"she smiled gratefully when a waiter placed a steaming plate of salmon and wild rice with fresh asparagus in front of her ."
"`` thank you , miles , '' she said , smiling her appreciation ."
"`` so you do n't buy furniture or clothes ."
"i know you do n't go on vacations ."
"what do you spend your salary on ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` why do you think i do n't go on vacations ? ''"
"she said evasively ."
"`` i do n't think , '' he said succinctly ."
"`` i know because i 've read the reports on your activities over the past six years . ''"
"her eyes snapped up to his ."
"she tried to hide her hurt by shrugging it off ."
"`` well , that seems a little invasive , '' she said ."
"`` your parents were concerned about you ."
"and i did n't read all the reports , only the summaries ."
"your parents , i believe , read the daily reports religiously . ''"
"sarila was uncomfortable with the topic but could n't let the subject drop easily ."
"`` there were daily reports ? ''"
"she asked , wondering if he was exaggerating ."
"he took a sip of wine before answering ."
"`` your parents love you very much ."
"they miss you and found that the reports were the only way they could be a part of your life ."
"it is just a pity you did n't allow them more . ''"
"she could hear the disapproval in his voice and resented it ."
"`` i know your thoughts on that subject ."
"can we move on ? ''"
"`` how about back ?"
"you still have n't told me what you spend your money on ? ''"
"`` no , i have n't have i ? ''"
"kasar smiled at her challenging expression ."
"`` and you 're not going to , are you ? ''"
"`` what do you spend your salary on ? ''"
"she asked , daring him to answer ."
"`` do you even have a salary ? ''"
"she asked curiously ."
"`` i have an annual annuity , '' he confirmed ."
"`` so , do tell , '' she said and took a sip of chilled white wine , `` what does the great prince kasar spend his money on ? ''"
"`` why do you want to know ? ''"
"he asked `` why do you want to know about my spending habits ? ''"
"she tossed back at him ."
"`` because you do n't seem to have any , '' he said simply ."
"she laughed at his response ."
"`` oh , i spend my money ."
"just not in areas most people think are important , '' she said , and tasted the salmon ."
"`` this is delicious , '' she said ."
"`` have you ever tried cooking ? ''"
"she asked , trying to change the subject ."
"`` so you donate all your income to your causes , '' he said , ignoring her question regarding cooking ."
"sarila was startled by his perceptiveness ."
"`` i love to cook although i 'm not very good at it , '' she said , ignoring his statement just as he had her question ."
"it was n't a query she needed to answer and she did n't feel the need to confirm his statement ."
"`` you know that phrase `` easy as pie '' is a complete myth ."
"pies are actually very difficult to make ."
"whoever made up that phrase is really a sadist who spread the comment just so others would try and make a pie , '' she said , wrinkling her nose at the memory of her last attempt at pie making ."
"`` why is that ? ''"
"sarila purposely mis-understood his question ."
"`` i do n't know ."
"you just have to have the right consistency in the fruit , i guess , '' she said , knowing he was n't asking about pies but about her spending ."
"`` and a more interesting question is why you try to hide it . ''"
"`` hide that i 'm bad at making pies ?"
"i do n't , believe me ."
"i invited some friends over one night in anticipation of them tasting my pie ."
"it was a total flop ."
"but we had a good laugh about it . ''"
"`` sarila , '' he warned , `` answer my question . ''"
"she put down her fork and delicately wiped her mouth ."
"`` i do n't want to answer any more questions about my spending . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` because it is my money and i 'll do with it whatever i want . ''"
"she hoped that would be the end of the conversation so she picked up her fork again and tried to taste another bite of the salmon ."
"but she was n't hungry anymore ."
"`` i understand and i completely agree ."
"what i want to know is why you 've hidden it so well that not even the daily reports picked up on that aspect of your life ."
"why would you hide such altruism ? ''"
"she put down her fork again and sighed , staring out the window at the setting sun ."
"she should know that the man would n't relent until he had his answers ."
"deciding that not answering his questions would only create more questions , she relented although it went against her principles to give in to his persistence ."
"`` since i did n't know i was being watched , i ca n't really tell you why it did n't show up on the reports ."
"sounds like a pretty awful investigator , which i 'm grateful for and i hope he left out a lot more things that i did . ''"
"he was instantly alert ."
"`` such as ? ''"
"he asked , the tension in his body indicating that her answer was very important to him ."
"sarila shrugged , aware of his tension but not sure of its reason ."
"`` oh , i ca n't think of anything off the top of my head but would you like all your actions viewed , reviewed , jotted down and re-read for someone else 's edification ? ''"
"he raised one eyebrow sardonically ."
"`` you forget my position ."
"all of my moves are reported upon ."
"either in the press or elsewhere ."
"and everything i do or say is analyzed , taken apart and my next action forecasted ."
"although i can sympathize with you to a point since you thought you were completely free and independent so finding out you have been ... .protected , '' he said for lack of a better word , `` probably came as a shock to someone of your independent spirit ."
"but i completely support your parents '' wishes to protect you ."
"it is every parent 's right to ensure the security of their children . ''"
"that took the wind out of her argument because he was right ."
"his actions even reached halfway across the world because she occasionally read about his activities on the internet ."
"`` well , then you know how intrusive it is ."
"you should n't have let it go on when you knew it was happening to me . ''"
"`` at the time , i did n't care . ''"
"that stopped her momentarily ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"she asked , looking right at him now ."
"he smiled , his eyes warming as he explained , `` because i knew you were being taken care of and we would eventually marry ."
"i was glad someone else had taken the responsibility ."
"otherwise , i would have had to retrieve you before now and we 'd be wed , probably with several children already . ''"
"the idea of having kadar 's children was too nice ."
"`` well , '' she said , clearing her throat and looking down at her plate again ."
"`` i guess , it is a good thing i was being watched then is n't it ?"
"for both our sakes ."
"right ? ''"
"kasar did n't answer ."
"in the awkward silence that followed , she searched for another subject ."
"`` anyway , you never answered my question either ."
"have you ever had any desire to cook ? ''"
"`` no . ''"
"he chuckled at her change of subject ."
"`` never ? ''"
"she asked , shocked despite her knowledge of his daily responsibilities which at times could be awesomely full ."
"he shook his head ."
"`` never ."
"why is that so shocking ? ''"
"`` i do n't know ."
"i guess for someone who has never been allowed or even encouraged to try it , cooking might be a difficult experience , '' she said ."
"`` i would imagine that cooking would be relatively simple , '' he said condescendingly ."
"sarila smiled at his arrogance ."
"`` interesting , '' she laughed ."
"`` so if i gave you a recipe , you think you could handle making it ? ''"
"`` i probably could n't cook a gourmet meal , '' he qualified ."
"`` but i would imagine that something simple i could do . ''"
"`` want to wager on that again ? ''"
"he leaned forward , his eyes instantly flaring at the idea ."
"`` same wager as last night ? ''"
"`` absolutely , '' she laughed , more confident over this wager ."
"`` let 's get to it , '' he said , undaunted by her optimistic smile ."
"`` now ? ''"
"`` what better time ? ''"
"he asked , standing up and pulling out her chair for her ."
"sarila laughed , delighted ."
"`` do you even know where the kitchen is ? ''"
"she asked ."
"kasar looked at the two doors connected to the dining room ."
"`` my amazing powers of deduction tell me that it is through one of these doors , '' he said ."
"he looked at the first one and found it connected to a hallway ."
"they followed that hallway until it came to the sleeping quarters and a cleaning closet ."
"`` well , this obviously is n't it , '' he said and turned around ."
"there was a moment of awkwardness when he turned around and they found themselves in a space too small to turn in ."
"he pinned her up against the hallway and looked down at her , their bodies touching from neck to hip and she lost her concentration ."
"`` but i like the search even if it is a dead end , '' he said ."
"she held her breath as he squeezed passed her and she suspected that his hands roamed a little too low on purpose ."
"they came back to the dining room and took the other door , which immediately led to the galley ."
"all the kitchen members were flown into chaos when kasar announced that he was going to cook something ."
"after a moment of stunned silence , the chef finally moved into action , demanding that the whole staff clean up the kitchens immediately , then vacate the area ."
"within five minutes , all the food was put away and the metal tables wiped immaculately clean ."
"the chef was just leaving when sarila called out to him in arabic , `` sir , please wait a moment , '' she called out ."
"the man stopped and bowed , `` how can i be of service , your highness ? ''"
"he asked , keeping his eyes down at the floor as he spoke ."
"sarila did n't correct him on her title since technically she was a princess ."
"`` i need a cookbook ."
"are there any available ? ''"
"he rushed over to a cabinet and opened it , revealing several cookbooks ranging in content from appetizers to desserts ."
"`` thank you , '' she said and pulled down a dessert book ."
"`` this should do the trick , '' she said , flipping through the pages and reading the various recipes ."
"walking over to the main table , she put the book in the middle and leaned over it , reading quickly through the recipes ."
"`` i wonder what would be good for dessert , '' she said , as if to herself ."
"`` do n't rush yourself , '' kasar said , leaning against the metal counter opposite her ."
"`` take your time reading through the recipes . ''"
"sarila ignored him as she read through several recipes until she finally came to the one she 'd been looking for ."
"she stood up and turned to face him only to find him leaning against another table , his eyes skimming her legs and , she suspected , her bottom ."
"`` concentrate , '' she said , her eyebrows drawing together and her cheeks flaring to red color ."
"`` i was , '' he assured her , a lascivious smile forming on his face ."
"sarila handed him the open book ."
"`` here ."
"make chocolate chip cookies , '' she said ."
"`` i 'll even get the ingredients out for you . ''"
"she moved off to the refrigerator and filled her arms up with butter and eggs ."
"she located the pantry and did the same as he called out the ingredients to her ."
"once all the ingredients were laid out , she pulled herself up onto a metal table and waited ."
"kasar leaned over the recipe book and read the words ."
"`` tsp ? ''"
"he asked , looking up at her questioningly ."
"`` yes ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` you 're not even going to tell me what a tsp is ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` nope ."
"you said you could do it , '' she said , grinning cheekily ."
"kasar raised one eyebrow , but then bent his head and looked at the ingredients ."
"`` am i missing something ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` a bowl , perhaps ? ''"
"she teased ."
"`` measuring cups ?"
"measuring spoons ?"
"you 'd better get going ."
"the bet is on . ''"
"`` you 're a mean woman , '' he said but turned and started searching through the cabinets for a large bowl ."
"he found one , and even located measuring cups and spoons ."
"then stood over the book for another five minutes trying to figure out what to do next ."
"`` what 's the hold up ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` i 'm trying to figure out how to get melted butter , '' he explained ."
"`` ah , yes ."
"very complicated procedure , '' she laughed ."
"kasar walked over to her table , pulled her up against his body and kissed her hard ."
"`` tell me how to melt butter , '' he demanded sensuously and nibbled on her lower lip ."
"sarila could n't think ."
"`` tell me , '' he repeated , and moved his lips lower to her neck ."
"`` this is cheating , '' she said , gasping as he moved to nibble on her earlobe ."
"his whole body was pressed against hers and she could feel every muscle in his as well as his reaction to their closeness ."
"it both frightened her and gave her courage that she had some sort of feminine power over him ."
"`` no , you did n't say i could n't ask questions , '' he said ."
"`` i 'm just asking , '' he explained and his finger pushed the strap of her sundress down her arm ."
"his lips followed and he alternated between kissing and nibbling her shoulder and collar bone ."
"`` microwave , '' she gasped when his mouth found the hollow of her throat ."
"`` in the microwave , '' she almost yelled ."
"`` hmm ... it might be worth losing the bet if i can continue in this way , '' he said and moved to her other shoulder to start nibbling there ."
"`` no ! ''"
"sarila said and pushed at his shoulders ."
"she laughed as his teeth tickled her neck ."
"`` you have to do it on your own ! ''"
"he stepped back and watched her , a sensuous gleam in his eyes ."
"`` are you sure you 'd rather win the bet ?"
"i can probably convince you that our current path is more interesting , '' he said ."
"`` are you conceding defeat ? ''"
"she asked hopefully ."
"`` no . ''"
"he shook his head and started toward her again ."
"`` then get to work , '' she said and pushed at his shoulders again ."
"she was n't sure what she was thinking ."
"the man was a mountain of muscles as well as being almost a foot taller than she was ."
"kasar would n't move unless he was good and ready ."
"`` i thought i was working , '' he said and dipped his head to kiss her lips again ."
"sarila was tempted to allow him but she remembered the previous night and pulled back ."
"`` no way , kasar ."
"you 're not getting any more information from me . ''"
"`` who wants information ? ''"
"he said and touched her lips ."
"`` just one kiss , '' he said ."
"sarila was not strong enough to resist him ."
"he was too charming and besides , she wanted to experience the feelings he could stir within her again ."
"she gave in and kissed him back ."
"as soon as she responded he pulled her body against his , holding her firmly as his mouth explored hers , his tongue moving inside and tasting her , touching her ."
"`` you taste like honey , '' he groaned , then kissed her again , this time with more heat and intensity ."
"she could n't respond with words but her body moved against his , needing to feel more of him ."
"her hands tentatively touched his shoulders and when she realized that it was okay , she touched his neck right above where his collar stopped , loving the feeling of the heat just under her fingertips ."
"her hands moved into his hair , pulling his head down to hers again ."
"kasar pulled his head up and smiled at her ."
"`` i guess i 'd better focus on this recipe rather than you or i 'm going to be out a lot of money , are n't i ? ''"
"sarila could only nod in agreement but she took her hands out of his hair ."
"`` you were saying something about a microwave ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"it is over there , '' she said and pointed to the microwave in the corner of the kitchen ."
"kasar brought the sticks of butter over to the black appliance and stared at it ."
"`` where 's the handle ? ''"
"he asked after a moment ."
"despite her body that was still pulsing with desire , sarila laughed at his confused expression ."
"the way he looked instantly relaxed her again and she got back into the spirit of the competition ."
"`` kasar , i think you 'd better give in on this one ."
"if you 're already stumped at the measuring abbreviations and melting butter , it only gets harder after this , '' she said ."
"`` just tell me where the damn handle is , '' he said , glaring at her teasingly ."
"`` no ."
"you 're on your own now ."
"i 'm just sticking around for the entertainment value , '' she said and found a radio that had a cd in it ."
"the player had an american band in it that played soft rock and she flipped it on , then headed back to her perch to watch him ."
"he 'd figured out how to open the microwave and was now trying to turn it on ."
"unfortunately , he figured it out ."
"and melted butter all over the appliance ."
"when he opened the door after the ding , the greasy mess spilled all over the table below and the floor ."
"if it were n't for his exceptional reaction time , it would have gotten on his beautifully tailored slacks ."
"`` oh , that is not going to be easy to clean up , '' she laughed ."
"kasar glared at the mess as if that would somehow make the mess disappear ."
"`` you knew that was going to happen , did n't you ? ''"
"he said accusingly ."
"`` no , '' she giggled ."
"`` i was trying to play music , remember ?"
"you 're the one who did n't realize that melted butter meant turning it into a liquid form from a solid ."
"most liquids need a container ."
"that 's just common sense , '' she said and hopped down off the table just as he reached her but she could n't control her laughter ."
"she was able to make it around to the other side of the table in time but he faced her on the opposite side ."
"`` tips like that need to be a little more timely , '' he growled ."
"she reached behind her and tossed him a dishrag ."
"`` sorry ."
"i 'll watch next time ."
"if you do anything else that might cause a big mess , believe me , i 'll speak up , '' she said , laughing hard now that he was so disgruntled ."
"sarila had to admire his tenacity if not his style ."
"he worked hard for the next two hours , mixing and measuring , starting over completely when the bowl filled up with a soupy mush ."
"she 'd never seen anyone so triumphant as kasar when he pulled out a tray of cookies , only to discover that they were black on the bottom and raw in the center ."
"`` what am i doing wrong ? ''"
"he demanded after spitting out the disgusting dough ."
"`` do you concede defeat ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he looked at her quietly for a moment , then nodded ."
"`` yes ."
"i concede ."
"you win ."
"now show me how to make these damn cookies ! ''"
"sarila hopped down off the table and lifted the spoon to his mouth ."
"`` first of all , taste , '' she said , then laughed at his horrified expression ."
"`` what happened ? ''"
"`` the tsp is an abbreviation for teaspoon ."
"i 've never thought of putting a quarter cup of salt into cookies but you 're definitely original ."
"and you need to actually measure the flour ."
"the first time , you did n't put enough flour into the batter . ''"
"she took out a clean bowl from the cabinet and dumped the other into the sink ."
"`` here , we 're starting over ."
"first of all , make sure that the oven is preheated ."
"that was probably why your cookies burned on the bottom ."
"the burners were just starting to heat up when you put the tray in . ''"
"she took him through the process of mixing and measuring and how all the ingredients should be put into the batter ."
"he stood behind her and watched , stirring when she told him to stir and generally just seeming to absorb everything she told him ."
"within twenty minutes , she handed him two spoons ."
"`` okay , big guy ."
"put a dollop of the batter onto the tray . ''"
"he did so but the second dollop , he put into his mouth ."
"`` hmmm ... .much more tasty , '' he said and bent down to kiss her again ."
"he tasted of chocolate and sugar , she thought , eagerly raising her mouth to his ."
"for some reason , she could n't get enough of his kisses tonight whereas last night , they terrified her ."
"she turned so she could experience the kiss more thoroughly and he took her in his arms and pulled her against him , his hands on her back , waist and sides as he kissed her mouth and neck ."
"after several minutes , he pulled away ."
"`` you 're just trying to distract me from my goal of having a cookie for dessert , '' he growled and smacked her bottom ."
"`` finish the lesson , '' he said ."
"sarila laughed and turned around , wishing she was more offended by his smack ."
"`` fine ."
"put this tray in the oven , but make sure the wire rack is in the center . ''"
"kasar did as she was told , then turned back to face her ."
"`` now what ? ''"
"`` now we wait eight or nine minutes , '' she said , smiling at him as she started to put leftover ingredients back into the refrigerator ."
"`` you mean we have eight minutes with nothing to do ? ''"
"`` there 's plenty to do , '' she said and slipped quickly out of his arms '' reach ."
"`` put the ingredients away . ''"
"`` no ."
"i pay several people a great deal of money to do that ."
"you 've proven your point on the cooking , but i 'm not cleaning , '' he said ."
"`` not when you are looking so smug over there ."
"i need to show you where my expertise really lies . ''"
"`` i 've experienced that and i can assure you that it is more than noted , '' she said , laughing as she slipped away again ."
"he continued to pursue her and eventually cornered her against the wall ."
"with her back against the wall and his hard , muscular chest against hers , she looked up at him , breathless ."
"`` no where to run , is there ? ''"
"he said and bent his head down ."
"sarila did n't want to run anymore ."
"she was intoxicated and addicted to his kisses now ."
"she loved the way he made her feel and her arms instantly moved to wrap around his neck as soon as he bent down to kiss her again ."
"this time , his hands did n't stop on her waist ."
"with his mouth moving over hers , his hands moved higher , resting just below her breast ."
"when she arched into his hand , he moved it higher and sarila moaned , her body shivering in reaction ."
"when his thumb flicked over the hardened peak under the fabric of her sundress and bra , her eyes snapped open and she gasp , her body almost collapsing against him , the feelings shooting right through her body , scaring her with their intensity ."
"the buzzer made her jump out of his arms and she glanced nervously up at him ."
"`` the cookies are done , '' she said breathlessly ."
"`` i 'm not , '' he groaned , his mouth moving back toward hers ."
"`` kasar no , please ."
"i ca n't , '' she said and stepped quickly away , her eyes avoiding contact with his ."
"sarila quickly walked over to the oven and put on the protective mitts ."
"she opened the door and pulled out the tray of cookies ."
"she quickly put it onto the table before her shaking hands dropped the soft cookies onto the floor ."
"`` they are ready , '' she said , still not able to even look at him ."
"kasar walked to where she was standing , her hands nervously fiddling with the spatula as she tried to pull the cookies off the tray ."
"`` sarila , '' he said , putting his hand over hers , forcing her to stop ."
"`` talk to me ."
"what did i do that you did n't like , '' he said ."
"his voice was husky and his eyes showed his concern for her fear ."
"`` nothing ."
"it was all very nice , '' she said shakily ."
"`` the buzzer went off ."
"that 's all . ''"
"`` then look at me , '' he ordered ."
"she could n't ."
"sarila ignored his command and focused on the cookies instead ."
"`` you have to get the cookies off , otherwise they will stick . ''"
"she pulled the cookies off and placed them on the cooling rack , not taking her eyes off her task for even a moment ."
"`` are you going to try one ? ''"
"she asked , staring down at the small pile of cookies that were now cooling ."
"kasar picked one up and tasted it ."
"`` they 're good , '' he said ."
"she took the oven mitts off and smiled in his general direction ."
"`` well , i 'd better get to bed ... i mean , to sleep , '' she clarified , her cheeks flaring at her slip ."
"`` i 'm going to sleep , '' she said again ."
"`` sarila stop , '' kasar ordered ."
"she heard the voice of authority and considered ignoring him but she thought he might just stop her physically and she was n't sure she could handle him touching her again ."
"she might just melt into his arms again or possibly run screaming , terrified from the room ."
"she was n't sure which reaction would be better ."
"`` what did i do wrong ? ''"
"he asked as soon as he was standing behind her ."
"she could n't look at him to reply ."
"`` you did nothing wrong ."
"believe me , '' she said and tried to leave ."
"but he stopped her with his hands on her upper arms ."
"`` then why are you running away again ? ''"
"`` kasar , i think ... '' she stopped ."
"she could n't tell him she was n't really what she 'd presented herself to be ."
"there would be no reason for him to back out of the betrothal ."
"`` i just do n't think this is a good idea , '' she finally finished ."
"he stared down at her flushed face , his angry eyes noting her trembling hands and lips ."
"`` you 're not really as free with your body as you 'd like everyone to believe , are you ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` in fact , i think what i just did scared you because you 'd never felt those feelings before , have you ? ''"
"sarila looked up at him and shook her head ."
"she did n't know what she 'd done wrong , but she had to counter his opinion and do it fast ."
"`` that 's not it at all , '' she said ."
"`` i just do n't want to ... . ''"
"she could n't even figure out an appropriate response ."
"kasar let his hand drop down her shoulder along her arm and smiled ."
"`` i think one of us is lying , '' he said softly ."
"sarila shivered and stepped out of his reach ."
"she tried desperately to appear casual and unaffected by his touch but was terrified that she was failing ."
"`` kasar , you 're making too much of this ."
"i just think sleeping with each other would be a bad thing at this juncture in our lives ."
"you 're looking for a wife which is n't me and i 'm looking for freedom ."
"with all the spies on this ship who might report to our parents , we really should remain just friends . ''"
"kasar eyed her closely ."
"`` i can assure you that everyone on this ship is completely loyal to me ."
"not a word of our actions will be brought back to our parents unless one of us tells them . ''"
"she shook her head , knowing how things worked ."
"`` even you ca n't guarantee something like that ."
"you know how much people talk ."
"even casual comments might jeopardize our goal ."
"goodnight , kasar , '' she said and fled out of the kitchen ."
"kasar watched her leave the kitchen , noting how her hips swayed slightly with each step ."
"she carried herself as if she were already a queen , he thought ."
"what is more , he suspected that she was trying to present an image to him that was n't necessarily the truth ."
"she obviously had n't been with many men if his instincts were correct ."
"and whoever had been her previous lover had n't taught her much in the way of lovemaking ."
"he sensed that the things he was doing to her were all new ."
"furthermore , kasar suspected that he did n't care if she 'd been with another man ."
"he wanted her enough to ignore that fact ."
"he did n't like the idea of another man touching her in the past , but she was extremely intelligent and compassionate ."
"he acknowledged to himself that those two qualities were much more important to him in a wife than innocence ."
"he ran his hands through his hair and glanced at the tray of cookies they 'd spent three hours baking ."
"he chuckled to himself as he picked up a second cookie , taking it with him as he left the kitchen to go to his office ."
"he considered that his mindset was traveling too far to the west if he was ignoring the idea of another man touching his fiancee ."
"he did n't question the fact that he was now thinking of her as his fiancee instead of only his unwanted betrothed ."
"he wanted her more than he 'd wanted any other woman ."
"what 's more , she intrigued him and more astonishing , he actually respected her ."
"there were n't many women he actually respected although he acknowledged that he had n't take the time to get to know many of them ."
"that was a feeling he did n't think he 'd have for this woman in particular ."
"those qualities did n't amaze him ."
"he 'd liked and respected women in the past ."
"he 'd met many women from all over the world ."
"but there was some un-definable quality about sarila that got to him ."
"something that made him want to hold her close and take care of her , assure her that everything would be okay ."
"and then make love with her until neither one of them cared if the rest of the world crumbled outside their bedroom , he added grimly ."
"he 'd only been around the woman for four days and he 'd basically been either fully or semi aroused almost continuously during that time ."
"he 'd have to do something about this situation ."
"chapter 7 sarila went back to her stateroom and fell onto the bed ."
"this was the second night in a row that she 'd stared up at the ceiling , trying to get her emotions and body to calm down ."
"kasar would be the ultimate lover , she thought ."
"no man had ever been able to touch her like that and make her feel such intensity ."
"she knew she was very close to just throwing in the towel and begging him to finish what they kept starting ."
"the thought occurred to her that it was possible to have an affair with him and then just walk away ."
"could she enjoy the feelings he stirred within her without any emotions attached ?"
"probably not , she told herself ."
"that was n't her style ."
"she 'd always known that when she gave herself to a man , it would be for something more than simple physical gratification ."
"sarila acknowledged that what she felt for kasar was more than just physical though ."
"she liked talking to him ."
"he made her laugh and get angry with little effort ."
"and she liked listening to him talk about the problems in abasar ."
"he would be a great king some day ."
"he cared deeply about the people and what happened to them ."
"their future was in his hands and he took that responsibility very seriously ."
"she changed into a pair of pajamas , tying the draw string at her waist and climbing into bed ."
"the satin sheets felt wonderful against her skin and she wished she had the courage to take off her clothes and sleep naked ."
"that thought brought her back to her predicament with kasar ."
"his comment scared her ."
"what had she done to make him think she was innocent ?"
"she was , but how had he known that ?"
"she 'd have to do something drastic tomorrow to change his mind ."
"she could n't let him go on thinking that she was fit to be his wife ."
"she 'd have to bring him back to his original thinking ."
"she needed his arguments against her parents to prove that they were not suited to be married ."
"she fell asleep considering different ideas ."
"they were too silly to really take any action ."
"she considered flirting with the rest of the crew , but since they absented themselves whenever she or kasar were around , she was n't sure if she could even find one let alone flirt with them ."
"and besides , kasar would most likely fire anyone caught flirting with a guest ."
"that would jeopardize someone 's future employment just to make a point and that would n't be fair ."
"she could start making phone calls to her friends back in california ."
"but she 'd have to make sure kasar was around at the time so she could make suggestive comments to them ."
"sarila did n't really know much about making suggestive comments so that might work , but she 'd really have to script something to make it work ."
"and timing on that would be difficult ."
"she fell asleep with no viable ideas ."
"sarila surveyed her closet the following morning ."
"there were several dresses that looked pretty but she had to do something drastic today ."
"she picked up a red bikini that was hanging on the wall ."
"did she dare ?"
"it was n't very risque in itself , but if she did n't wear the top ... ."
"would that prove to him that she was not so innocent ?"
"did she have the courage ?"
"sarila put the bathing suit on and looked at her image ."
"she had relatively large breasts but the rest of her was thin and fit ."
"the suit looked nice ."
"she pulled on the matching cover up , tying it to her waist , deciding she needed to work up to going topless ."
"the cover up was a sheer piece of red chiffon that was more suggestive than concealing ."
"she picked up a hat and carried a book with her ."
"she was nervous about what she was planning , not sure if she could actually go through with it but determined to try ."
"he met her in the breakfast area and his eyes sharpened when he took in her body scantily clad in the red bikini so early in the morning ."
"`` what are your plans for the day ? ''"
"he asked , turning to get her a cup of coffee ."
"`` i thought i 'd sit by the pool and read ."
"what about you ? ''"
"`` i have work to do , '' he said and set her coffee cup in front of her ."
"`` are you hungry ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` not really , '' she said , trying to sound casual ."
"`` i 'll have the staff bring me something later if i get hungry ."
"what are you working on today ? ''"
"she asked , putting her sunglasses on so he could n't see the nervousness in her eyes ."
"she was so nervous , she did n't dare pick up the cup , afraid it would rattle in the delicate china saucer ."
"`` i have phone calls to make , '' he said ."
"a servant came up behind him and handed him a written message , then quickly walked away ."
"kasar read the message , then crumpled it up in his hand , tossing it onto the table ."
"`` what was that about ? ''"
"she asked , sensing his frustration ."
"`` one of the tribal leaders in the north is still pushing to get the road to not go through is village ."
"nothing that ca n't be overcome , but it will be difficult to negotiate ."
"the man seems unwilling to even discuss the issue . ''"
"she tapped her finger against her nose absently as she thought back to her previously overheard conversation between her father and mother when she was a teenager still at home ."
"`` hmm ... if it is a stubborn leader from the north , it can only be one of two people ."
"i 'm guessing it is mohammed idir ."
"am i right ? ''"
"the subject change calmed her down ."
"this was turf she could understand , she told herself ."
"kasar looked at her sharply and nodded ."
"`` correct . ''"
"`` you should have known that he 'd object , '' she replied casually and sipped her coffee ."
"he raised one eyebrow in obvious skepticism ."
"`` why is that ? ''"
"sarila frowned ."
"`` because his granddaughter was hit by a car about fifteen years ago when she went to the capital one day ."
"she recovered , but it was a serious accident ."
"it was touch and go for a while . ''"
"kadar 's eyes sharpened at the memory ."
"`` now that you mention it , that incident does ring a bell ."
"that would make sense ."
"he 's not even trying to negotiate this road ."
"just telling his people that they should oppose it . ''"
"sarila laughed and nodded her head , knowing that the stubborn old tribal leader would probably stage a sit in if it would work ."
"`` tell him you understand his position and it will go through istim instead . ''"
"kasar immediately shook his head , denying her solution out of hand ."
"`` the tribal leader of istim is opposed to the government ."
"he 's been causing problems for the past twenty years with mischief ."
"i refuse to reward him now because of all the trouble he 's caused . ''"
"sarila shook her head just as he had a moment ago ."
"`` you 're not going to put the road through istim ."
"just tell mohammed idir that you 're going to do that ."
"the leader of istim is mohammed bening ."
"unless things have changed dramatically in the past six years , which i doubt , those two have hated each other for several decades and compete with each other over the smallest bag of rice ."
"at least they used to , '' she said , shaking her head at the memory of her father discussing their nuisance arguments that were constantly brought to the government 's notice ."
"he eyed her skeptically but kept on listening ."
"`` you think pitting the two against each other will resolve the road issue ?"
"i 'm not sure it will do any good . ''"
"sarila sighed and shook her head ."
"`` kasar , think about it ."
"you 're not going to divert the road that i 'm guessing is nearly to istim 's doorstep , right ? ''"
"she only waited long enough for him to nod his confirmation ."
"`` so moving the road would be a huge disruption and expense ."
"all you need to do is nudge the old rivalry between idir and bening , use it to your advantage for once ."
"bening will be delighted that you 're giving him something that will help him with his silly little plots against you but that will bring istim to the negotiating table ."
"you can then back off the offer to bening , offer to ensure that the road is adequately marked , add in a fence to block off walkers and a walking bridge over the highway to ensure safety ."
"kill two birds with one stone , so to speak ."
"then you can explain to bening that istim 's loyalty is more important and he 'll receive the road ."
"you punish bening for his irritations in the past and reward istim but still provide for the safety of his village . ''"
"kasar considered her idea ."
"he had forgotten about the irritating battles that raged between the two villages ."
"they had been fighting with each other for so long it did n't even make it to his daily reports anymore since no one got hurt now ."
"her idea had merit on several sides ."
"another servant appeared and handed him yet another note ."
"kasar read the message and smiled ."
"`` sarila , i believe you might have hit upon something , '' he said and stood up ."
"he quickly bent over her chair and kissed her soundly before moving off and inside the ship ."
"sarila sat there , unable to move after his brief kiss ."
"she was n't sure her legs would carry her anywhere ."
"and he 'd left before she could carry out her plan of walking to the pool , taking off her top and laying down on one of the loungers ."
"she had been hoping he would watch her and then move off into the ship in disgust ."
"how was she supposed to repulse him with her promiscuous actions if he was n't around to view them , she thought angrily , draining her coffee cup ."
"she stood up and walked over to one of the pool deck chairs ."
"she dropped her book onto the extra wide chairs which were large enough to hold three people ."
"sarila looked up at the sky and sighed ."
"it was still a beautiful day so she might as well spend it in the sunshine reading as opposed to inside working some more ."
"she sat down and pulled her book onto her lap ."
"with her hat on her head and sunglasses shading her eyes , she considered her options ."
"should she just do it anyway ?"
"he was sure to come back and give her information about istim and idir ."
"or at least be back here for lunch ."
"as far as she knew , he had n't eaten any breakfast so he 'd probably be hungry pretty soon ."
"his words from the previous night came back to haunt her ."
"she 'd better do something and it would have to be pretty drastic ."
"they could not arrive back in abasar with him not able to argue that she was too promiscuous ."
"and it had to be convincing ."
"with shaking fingers , she reached behind her and untied the strings to her top ."
"the top loosened and she tossed it down on the cushion next to her ."
"but after only a second or two , she rolled onto her stomach , hiding her bare breasts ."
"she pulled the book over to her and started reading ."
"after an hour , her neck started to hurt ."
"she laid her head down on the cushion and within moments , she was fast asleep ."
"after two sleepless nights , she was unable to keep herself from falling asleep under the warm sunshine ."
"two hours later , kasar hung up the phone and smiled to himself ."
"his aid , nabir , was seated across the table from him and returned the smile ."
"`` that was a stroke of genius , your highness , '' he said ."
"`` i agree , '' kasar laughed , astonished at how quickly the issue had been taken care of ."
"the road would go through istim 's village and bening was probably already on his way to the capital to lobby for a road to be built through his town as well ."
"the man had initially been delighted when kasar had called but dismayed when he realized he was on a conference call with istim ."
"the two had immediately started arguing back and forth but within fifteen minutes , kasar stepped back in and worked out the details ."
"kasar shook his head in astonishment at how easy and ingenious the idea had been ."
"`` i wish i could take credit for the idea , but it came from sarila ."
"she was the one who remembered their feud ."
"she also remembered the reason why istim was so opposed to the road coming through . ''"
"nabir nodded , smiling himself at the outcome of what could have been a severely trying day as they attempted to persuade a stubborn old tribal leader to support a plan he had been mysteriously against ."
"`` thank goodness for her highness ."
"a man could n't ask for a better wife , '' he said sagely ."
"kasar agreed ."
"`` i guess the only thing left now is to tell her that her plan worked ."
"can you send a messenger to bring her here ? ''"
"kasar asked and turned to start reading another report ."
"when nabir did n't instantly rise to carry out the task , kasar looked up curiously ."
"nabir was actually blushing ."
"`` what 's wrong , old friend ? ''"
"kasar asked , leaning forward again ."
"it was a rare moment that the ever calm nabir had a moment of discomfiture ."
"`` i think it would be best if you relayed the good news to her yourself , '' he said with a knowing look toward his employer ."
"kasar did n't understand ."
"`` what 's the issue , nabir ? ''"
"nabir cleared his throat and smiled tightly ."
"`` i believe your future bride has chosen to show you she is still unworthy of the position , '' he said ."
"it took only a moment for kasar to understand his advisor 's meaning ."
"kasar laughed heartily ."
"`` is she now ? ''"
"he said and rose from the desk ."
"`` i 'm guessing from the expression on your face that i 'm going to enjoy her latest act of defiance , are n't i ? ''"
"he said , already halfway out of the office ."
"`` she 's by the pool , '' nabir called out ."
"nabir 's direction was heeded ."
"kasar stopped by his room and changed into his bathing suit , then headed on deck to find out what she had done this time ."
"he was very eager to find out ."
"maybe she was wearing a smaller bathing suit than what she 'd worn earlier ."
"he hoped not ."
"that one had just about floored him when she 'd shown up ."
"he 'd been expecting her normal shorts and shirt so when she 'd shown up in a bathing suit with a sheer piece of fabric covering her legs and hips , his body had instantly hardened to the point of pain ."
"kasar took the stairs to the upper deck two at a time and looked around to find her ."
"as soon as his eyes caught sight of her , he was just as hard again as he had been this morning ."
"his eyes caught the scrap of red material next to her and no telltale sign of the material across her back ."
"kasar walked over to her chair and noticed she was asleep ."
"he picked up a bottle of sunscreen that was always kept available for guests ' use and then sat back down on the lounger , tossing the bikini top onto the deck beside him , completely out of her reach ."
"he was merciless ."
"with a quick squeeze , he poured a large amount of sunscreen on her back ."
"the cold liquid instantly woke her up but kasar was disappointed when she did n't come all the way up , still hiding her beautiful breasts against the cushions ."
"`` what are you doing ? ''"
"she demanded , fixing her sunglasses so they were better settled on her nose ."
"`` you 're burning , '' he said ."
"`` the sun out here is pretty dangerous , '' he explained ."
"`` relax and i 'll put sunscreen on your back , '' he said ."
"`` i did that in my stateroom before coming out here , '' she said , her voice sounded desperate ."
"his hands on her back were burning her skin more harshly than the sun ever could ."
"the heat from his hands was making her weak and shaky at the same time and something was happening elsewhere too ."
"desire was pooling between her legs , making her want to moan in pleasure so intense it was almost painful to endure ."
"kasar moved his hands across her back in a soothing motion ."
"`` that was over two hours ago ."
"you should apply sunscreen every thirty minutes or more , '' and his hands dipped off to the sides , touching the soft sides of her breasts , then quickly moving back onto her back ."
"`` you really do n't have to do this , '' she said , her breath coming in gasps now as his hands moved sensuously across her back ."
"`` of course i do ."
"i have a responsibility to make sure you arrive safe and sound to abasar , '' he said ."
"`` what would your parents think if i brought you home and you were red like a lobster ? ''"
"`` they would say i was not very responsible , which i am , '' she said ."
"`` please , kasar ... '' she said , then moaned as he put the cold lotion on her legs ."
"his hands followed moments later , warming the lotion and moving along her upper thighs , inside , outside , his fingers sliding under the elastic of her bikini bottoms then down to the sensitive skin behind her legs ."
"her calves received the same attention as did her feet and sarila was unable to say anything more as his hands moved along her body , creating a path of fire wherever they went ."
"`` the back is done , '' he said into her ear , his chest touching her back and his hand resting on the small of her back , moving lightly along her spine , making her back arch and her hips move restlessly ."
"`` turn over and i 'll do the front , '' he whispered ."
"`` kasar , i ca n't , '' she said , her voice coming painfully past her throat ."
"`` yes you can , '' he countered ."
"`` roll over , '' he said ."
"she could n't answer because his fingers were moving along her sides touching her breasts as if by accident ."
"she arched into his hand , her body responding despite her mind 's attempts to tell him to stop ."
"`` turn over , sarila , '' he said again ."
"this time , he prompted her with his hands and she could n't stop him ."
"her body turned over of its own accord and sarila found herself staring up at his face , watching as his eyes looked at her , moving downwards to gaze at her bare breasts , her nipples already hard and proud , waiting for his touch ."
"they do n't have to wait long ."
"kasar moved his hand slightly , his fingertips touching the sides again , then moving around to her ribcage , resting just underneath the soft mounds ."
"`` you 're beautiful , '' he said ."
"`` more beautiful than i could have imagined . ''"
"sarila 's hands were laying at her sides but with his words , she put them on his face , her fingers sliding into his hair and pulling him down to kiss her waiting lips ."
"she kissed him with all the passion that he had ignited within her , moving her tongue into his mouth without waiting for his first ."
"her body arched and his hand moved to her breast , his palm finally covering her nipple and she gasped as he moved his hand over her breast ."
"`` relax , '' he said , his mouth barely moving from hers as he said the word ."
"then he was kissing her again , his hand still moving over her breast , massaging the aching flesh ."
"his thumb flicked over her nipple and sarila cried out , her eyes flashing wide open but his mouth just covered hers again , distracting her from his thumb ."
"his mouth moved from her lips to her jaw , then slowly made its way over to her ear , nibbling on the sensitive lobe , then moving downwards to her neck ."
"eventually , his mouth reached its goal and when his lips kissed the hard peak , she just about lifted off the lounge chair ."
"she pulled at his hair as her voice cried out but he ignored her cries and his mouth covered her nipple , his tongue rubbing across the sensitive peak ."
"instead of pulling at his hair , her hands started clinging to him , keeping his mouth where it was ."
"she had no concept of time or place ."
"all she knew was that fire was shooting through her veins and it was all connected to kasar and his mouth that was now moving to lathe her other nipple with the same attention as the first ."
"it was n't until his hand moved lower , a thumb pulling at the elastic of her bikini bottoms that sarila gained a conscious thought ."
"then the panic set in ."
"she grabbed his hand and pulled , stopping him from moving any further ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"he asked , his eyes confused ."
"when he saw the panic in her eyes , his head dropped to her bare chest and he sucked in his breath ."
"when she tried to move out from underneath him , he grabbed her wrists and held her still ."
"`` sarila , i know you 're terrified right now but if you move , even an inch , i ca n't guarantee that i 'll be able to stop ."
"i 'm trying with every fiber of my being to control myself now , but you feel too good underneath me ."
"so do n't move ! ''"
"he said through gritted teeth ."
"sarila froze , not even letting her body take in oxygen ."
"she too was throbbing with the unleashed passion but it was also the very thing that was scaring her ."
"she could n't handle these feelings and did n't understand what he was going to do next ."
"oh , she understood the mechanics of the sexual act , but no one and nothing in her past had prepared her for the almost vicious desire that had been ripping through her system , tearing her sanity to shreds ."
"with a few choice words , kasar stood up and with one deft movement , dove into the cold water of the pool ."
"sarila quickly found her bathing suit top and put it on , knowing now that this had been a very bad move on her part ."
"she watched in shame as kasar swam laps for over twenty minutes , pushing himself harder and harder with each lap ."
"she knew he was trying to get her out of his system and cool down his body ."
"she also wanted to dive into the water since her nerves were just as strung out ."
"but she did n't dare come close to him by diving in and trying to cool off herself ."
"finally , he got out of the water and dried himself off ."
"without a passing glance , he walked by her ."
"`` i 'll see you tonight at dinner , sara . ''"
"sarila waited at least fifteen minutes , hoping to give him enough time to get back to his stateroom before she stood up , grabbed her book and did the same thing ."
"as soon as she was alone , she took off the bathing suit and threw it into the trash , not wanting to ever see it again , much less wear it ."
"she walked into the bathroom naked and turned on the shower to cold , then stepped in , gasping when the icy spray hit her body ."
"but it did the job ."
"she was distracted enough to not feel like her body was going to explode from the feelings his touch ignited ."
"she dressed in a pair of khaki shorts and a white shirt , then stayed in her room trying to read for the rest of the day ."
"she did n't leave for lunch , not wanting to accidentally run into kasar ."
"she did n't know if he 'd had a chance to calm down , but she did n't want to find out , just in case he was still angry with her ."
"by dinner , she was starving ."
"she knew she could call for something to be delivered to her room , but she remembered his parting shot that he 'd see her at dinner ."
"she did n't want to cower in her room ."
"if she did , he 'd know that she was hiding ."
"as torn apart as she was currently feeling , she just could n't stand the thought of him knowing she was hiding from him , even if that 's what she desperately wanted to do ."
"pride was a painful thing to maintain , she told herself ."
"she surveyed the dresses available and chose a simple white dress with a full skirt that tied at the waist with a black bow ."
"she tied her long black hair into a braid , then twisted it around , pinning it at her neck ."
"looking in the mirror , she knew that she at least looked sophisticated , even though she did n't feel like it ."
"she felt like an eighth grader after her first date that had gone badly ."
"now she had to face her date in school and was ashamed ."
"at least she did n't have all of her classmates to face as well , and possibly scoff ."
"only kasar to laugh at her , and be angry with her ."
"would he still be furious ?"
"or would he have calmed down enough to understand her perspective ?"
"she doubted the latter ."
"squaring her shoulders , she walked determinedly out the door ."
"she knew she had to face him eventually so it might as well be now ."
"delaying the inevitable only created more problems later on ."
"she knew she looked her best and that was about the only armor she was going to have with kasar since he stripped all of her other defenses away ."
"she walked into the dining room and found kasar already there ."
"he was n't drinking a glass of wine tonight ."
"he was nursing a bourbon , straight up and looking anything but calm ."
"he did n't say anything as she walked into the room but his eyes traveled from her jet black hair neatly tied up all the way down to her black , strappy sandals ."
"`` do i pass inspection ? ''"
"she asked , smiling in an effort to break the ice ."
"he did n't answer immediately ."
"when her smile started to falter , he said , `` you 'll do . ''"
"with that , he sat down at the table and nodded to the servant who was waiting to serve them ."
"sarila sat down in the chair next to him and smiled gratefully to the servant who placed a plate of grilled lemon chicken , steamed broccoli and some sort of cheesy potato in front of her ."
"`` thank you , '' she said ."
"she sampled the chicken and found that it was tender and juicy with a wonderful herbal tang to it ."
"`` oh , this is delicious , '' she said , trying to come up with a topic of conversation to break the tension ."
"`` i 'll take your word for it , '' he said , and took another sip of his drink ."
"he did n't touch his meal , but just sourly stared across the table at her ."
"sarila was self-conscious but tried to put on a good front ."
"smiling brightly , she searched valiantly for some sort of conversation ."
"`` did you get a lot of work done today ? ''"
"she asked , changing the subject ."
"`` no . ''"
"her smile faltered with his one word reply ."
"obviously , he was n't going to help her with the other half of the conversation ."
"`` oh , well , neither did i , '' she said , but her words trailed off toward the end ."
"he did n't elaborate , but continued to nurse his drink ."
"sarila struggled to come up with another topic but her mind drew a blank ."
"she just continued to eat but it turned out that she was n't as hungry as she 'd originally thought ."
"at least , she was n't interested in eating when kasar just sat across from her , staring at her and sipping his drink ."
"she could n't tell if he 'd had more than one drink but she knew she did n't want to find out ."
"when half her dinner was gone , she put her fork down and smiled up at him ."
"`` did you resolve the issue with the roads ? ''"
"she finally thought to ask ."
"`` yes ."
"your solution worked ."
"thank you for suggesting it , '' he said brusquely ."
"again , he did n't elaborate and she was out of ideas ."
"her mind scrambled for another topic ."
"`` how is your father doing ? ''"
"`` fine . ''"
"sarila nodded ."
"`` and your mother ? ''"
"`` fine as well . ''"
"`` have you spoken to either of them in the past few days ? ''"
"`` no . ''"
"her shoulders slumped ."
"`` well , i 'm sorry to hear that . ''"
"kasar stood up and walked to the window ."
"sarila also stood up , trying to think of a topic that would engage him a little more ."
"`` would you like to play a game tonight ? ''"
"she asked ."
"kasar swung around and looked at her , his eyes penetrating deep into her soul ."
"she backed up a step , then continued backing up with each step he took toward her ."
"`` no , sara ."
"i do n't want to play a game , '' he rapped out , his anger finally showing in no uncertain terms ."
"`` i want to pull you into my arms , carry you downstairs to my bedroom , tear off those clothes and make love with you ."
"play a game ?"
"i 'm sorry , but you 're the only one that is good at that ."
"i do n't like playing games , '' he said and slammed his glass down into the table , took her into his arms and kissed her hard ."
"this kiss was n't meant to seduce but to punish and it did that very effectively in sarila 's mind ."
"but it did n't diminish its effect on her system ."
"it seems that any kind of contact with kasar just flamed her desire into a raging fire again ."
"after only a moment , he released her and walked quickly out of the dining room , leaving sarila to stare after him , her fingers touching her bruised lips gently ."
"she looked at the glass he 'd just put down ."
"he was right , she told herself ."
"she was playing games ."
"both with him and with herself ."
"she wanted him unlike any other man she 'd ever known ."
"and she only had eight more days to be alone with him ."
"she walked over to the window that looked out onto the setting sun ."
"soon they would arrive in abasar and they would talk to their respective parents and explain that their relationship simply would not work ."
"their parents would be upset but they would break the betrothal contract ."
"after that , she would fly back to california , he 'd continue to rule abasar and eventually be crowned king and she would probably never see him ."
"and if by some bizarre reason she did see him at some sort of event or even on television , he would be married to someone else ."
"sarila had had a crush on him since she was thirteen years old and had truly started looking at men as something other than just another source of irritation ."
"in the beginning , she had been proud to know that kasar would eventually be her husband ."
"she had been happy with her future until that fateful day she 'd seen him kissing another woman in the gardens ."
"it had been her jealousy that had pushed her out the door and into another life , one without him or her parents ."
"did she really want to do that again but with the knowledge as an adult of what things could have been like between the two of them ?"
"did she want to go back to california and find a husband to marry that could only produce half of the feelings kasar produced within her ?"
"or did she want to find out what all the fuss was about with a man who knew how to turn her on ?"
"she could experience what real lovemaking was like before she had to go home again to her cold , barren existence ."
"she 'd never really dated anyone before kasar showed up ."
"why did she think someone was going to magically appear after she left him ?"
"as a lover , she could never ask for anyone better than kasar ."
"but if she followed the path her mind was considering , what would be the consequences ?"
"she could get pregnant ."
"but there were ways to avoid that happening ."
"the only real danger was her heart ."
"but with a cold analysis of the situation , she knew that her heart was already gone ."
"she 'd never stopped thinking about him , but now she knew him as a man ."
"she 'd only been back around him for four days and already , she was fascinated with his every move , wanted to talk to him all the time , ask him questions ."
"sighing , she knew that there was only one course of action ."
"she drank the rest of her wine and watched the sun set on the horizon ."
"when there was no more orange ball , only the brighter blue on the horizon that eventually faded into black , she went in search of the man on her mind ."
"she found his room accidentally ."
"it was n't on the floor with all the other guest rooms ."
"it was on the upper floors and had a double door with the abasar insignia on it ."
"she lifted her hand to knock and scowled at the shaking ."
"but she forced herself to knock anyway ."
"it was now or never , she told herself ."
"the door opened almost instantly and kasar stood there , wrapped in only a towel , wet little droplets still on his chest ."
"she stared at those drops , fascinated by them , wanting to touch them and see if they were cold like the shower he probably just took or if they were warm like his skin ."
"`` i 'd be glad to stand here and let you admire my chest , but i 'm more interested in the reason for your visit , '' kasar said , his voice deep and his hands on his hips ."
"`` i wanted to apologize about this morning , '' she said , her voice quivering ."
"kasar shook his head and pulled her into the room , closing the door behind her ."
"`` that 's fascinating but i 'd be more interested in finding out why it could n't wait until tomorrow morning , '' he said and disappeared behind a door ."
"he came out a moment later with a robe on ."
"she watched as he tied the sash , then walked over to look down at her ."
"`` sara ? ''"
"`` yes , '' she said , snapping out of her trance ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"i just ... i ... ''"
"she could n't come up with the words to tell him her motives ."
"she could still see his chest through the folds of his robe that did n't quite cover him ."
"the sparse , black hair that peeked out through the thick , white terry cloth fascinated her ."
"her hands itched to touch it , to feel it through her fingers and touch the skin and muscles underneath ."
"`` that still does n't help me . ''"
"kadar 's words snapped her out of her sexual fantasy ."
"taking a deep breath , she took the step that separated them ."
"putting her palm on his chest , she could feel his beating heart ."
"looking up at him , she licked her lips and smiled tentatively ."
"`` i wanted to finish what we started , '' she said ."
"he grabbed her wrist in a painful grip ."
"`` do you have any idea what you 're playing at sarila ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"his other arm wrapped around her waist and pulled her against his body ."
"she did n't struggle against him , just looked up at him with her desire in her eyes ."
"`` i 'm not playing , kasar ."
"i want you ."
"i just do n't know ... well , i do n't really know exactly how to tell you , '' she finally got out ."
"her words were little more than a whisper at the end ."
"his grip stopped being painful on her wrist but his other arm pulled her closer ."
"`` do n't tease me sarila ."
"a man can only take so much , '' he said ."
"`` i want you now ."
"if you are n't ready for this , then you 'd better leave right now . ''"
"she continued to look at him ."
"`` i 'm not going anywhere , '' she said ."
"her gaze dropped to his lips and she licked hers , feeling parched suddenly ."
"`` put your hands on me , '' he said , his voice rough ."
"she did as he said , one hand slipping inside his robe exactly as she 'd longed to do only moments before , the other moving around his neck ."
"`` now what ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` kiss me , '' he said ."
"she lifted herself up on her toes and placed her lips on his still ones ."
"she was n't deterred , though ."
"she rubbed her lips against his exactly as he had done to her earlier ."
"when he still did n't move or respond , she touched her tongue to his lips , gently rubbing back and forth , nibbling on his lower lip , her fingers touching his strong jaw and moving to the side to slip up into his thick , black hair ."
"the sharp intake of his breath was the end of her wait ."
"his mouth took over , covering hers , his thumb moving up to her mouth to force it open so his tongue could move inside ."
"she did n't mind though ."
"in fact , that allowed her hands to move higher , her fingers to tangle in his hair ."
"sarila groaned when his hand moved to her sundress , the strap falling down and his mouth moved from hers to travel along her jaw , eventually coming to her ear then moving down to kiss her collar bone ."
"`` touch me , '' he groaned and pushed her hand against his chest ."
"her fingers did n't need any additional permission ."
"they moved to his shoulder , pushing the fabric of his robe away just as she felt the zipper slide slowly down her back , gently releasing her dress which fell gracefully to the floor ."
"kasar stood back and took in her body , standing in front of him in a lacy black bra , matching underwear and only her high , black sandals ."
"sarila tried to cover herself but his hands stopped her ."
"again , he pulled her hands to his skin , then pulled it lower , directing her hand to pull the loose belt ."
"sarila started to undo it , but at the last minute , she lost her nerve and pushed her body against his ."
"kasar chuckled and finished pulling the robe off but had a moment of compassion ."
"as soon as the robe fell to the floor , he pulled her against him , groaning again as their skin touched ."
"`` i want you , '' he said and lifted her in his arms , placing her gently in the center of the bed ."
"he stood up and looked down at her , his body fully naked and unembarrassed by it ."
"kasar came down after her , his body held just inches above hers , held there by his strong arms as his mouth reached down and took her nipple , the sparks of desire increased as the lace rubbed against her nipple and his tongue , creating a friction that drove her mad ."
"then suddenly , the fabric was gone and it was only the heat from his mouth covering her nipple ."
"sarila arched her back and gasped at the same time ."
"`` kasar ! ''"
"she exclaimed , her hands gripping his shoulders and her legs moving restlessly against the bed ."
"`` please ! ''"
"she pleaded but was n't sure what she was asking for ."
"`` tell me what you like , '' he said and moved his mouth to the other breast , giving the other nipple just as much attention ."
"`` do you like that ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` yes , do n't stop , '' she said , her hands diving into his hair and holding his head in place ."
"his hand moved downward , gliding against her waist , her hip , then to her thigh ."
"eventually , he moved to the inside of her thigh but sarila 's legs closed quickly ."
"she was unsure what to do and embarrassed that her body wanted so much for him to touch her in the most private place ."
"`` open up for me , sarila , '' he said , his voice husky as he whispered in her ear , taking her ear lobe between his teeth while his hands made small circles over her stomach and her thighs ."
"`` i promise i wo n't hurt you , '' he said ."
"sarila opened her eyes and looked at him , her body becoming hotter when her eyes connected with his heated glance ."
"his hand moved upwards , his fingers touching her nipples , one finger circling the hard pebble which made her hips move once again ."
"kadar 's hand slowly moved downward and this time sarila did n't close up ."
"in fact , her body opened to his questing hand without question ."
"when one finger entered her , sarila cried out in shock and pleasure ."
"as he touched her nubbin , she was unable to stop the feelings that exploded within her ."
"throwing one leg over his , she arched her back and cried out as her first orgasm took over , her body closing around his finger and throbbing ."
"eventually , she calmed down and opened her eyes , her hand reaching up to touch his cheek ."
"`` oh , my , '' was all she could say ."
"kasar chuckled , a deep chested laugh that lit up his eyes and heated her skin just as strongly as any touch from him could ."
"`` i 'm afraid that 's only the beginning , little one . ''"
"his mouth came down on hers just as his fingers moved back inside her ."
"this time , his legs spread hers , making room for his hips ."
"but sarila was no longer nervous ."
"in fact , when his lips touched hers , the flames flared up once again and her hips moved restlessly underneath his ."
"`` kasar ! ''"
"she said , when his finger moved slightly , flicking her aroused flesh but he would n't take her further this time ."
"`` why ? ''"
"she demanded , straining for the release she 'd just experienced and he 'd given her so easily ."
"but now he was holding back and driving her wild ."
"`` why ? ''"
"she asked again ."
"`` hold on to me , sarila , '' he said and held her shoulders as his body moved into her slick one ."
"sarila gasped as his body filled hers , the movement heating her up and her body was bracing for the next climax ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he said and a moment later , pushed against the barrier that claimed she was still a virgin ."
"sarila gasped and froze but almost instantly , the pain was gone , replaced by the demanding pulse of her body ."
"looking up , she bit her lower lip , her hands moving to his shoulders and smiling up at him ."
"`` i 'm okay , '' she assured him , one finger smoothing the worried lines across his forehead ."
"with a moan , kasar moved and the friction of his body against hers caused a heat wave to crash against her ."
"she moved with him , increasing the pleasure and within moments , she was exploding again , this time more intense and her legs moved around his waist , clasping him to her as he pounded into her , finding his own release moments later ."
"chapter 8 sarila woke just as the sun was rising the next morning ."
"because kadar 's stateroom took over the whole front of the ship , it had windows on three sides ."
"apparently he could watch the sun set on one side and rise on the other ."
"sarila watched the rays shoot up over the horizon for a moment , not wanting to move ."
"the morning was too perfect ."
"kasar had woken her several times during the night and made love with her , teaching her so much she had n't even imagined ."
"he was the ultimate lover , she suspected ."
"now , her back was pulled tightly against is chest , her bottom nuzzled against his groin and his arm was holding her around her waist ."
"it was as if he did n't want to lose her , even in his sleep ."
"she knew she was putting meanings to their position that probably were n't there , but this was her fantasy and she 'd adjust it to her preferences any way she wanted ."
"sighing , she moved one leg , intending to roll over so she was facing him then fall back to sleep ."
"she was still exhausted ."
"kasar was a wonderful lover , but he was also demanding and thorough ."
"each time he 'd woken her up , he 'd touched her and kissed her everywhere until she was screaming or begging him to take her ."
"and each time she 'd climaxed had been more intense than the previous one ."
"they 'd come to know each other 's bodies and known what to do to pleasure the other ."
"apparently , the movement of her body awakened kasar because his hand slipped up her back and his erection grew against her thigh ."
"the thought had n't fully formed when his hand covered her bottom then moving down to caress her thigh ."
"the feelings his touch stirred made her stomach clench in anticipation and she looked up to find him watching her ."
"`` how do you feel ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she could barely think as his hand moved back up her body , touching a sensitive spot on her back ."
"`` a little desperate , '' she gasped as his hand moved around to her rib cage ."
"`` are you too sore ? ''"
"he asked , rolling her onto her back and kissing her neck ."
"`` what would you do if i said yes ? ''"
"`` i 'd stop , '' he confirmed without hesitation , and he lifted his head to look into her eyes ."
"`` are you ? ''"
"he asked and the concern was apparent in his eyes ."
"`` no , '' she said and she shifted her body underneath him ."
"`` please do n't stop , '' she said and pulled his head down toward hers to kiss him , her hands roaming along his chest and the muscles of his arms , amazed again at how wonderful his body felt to her touch ."
"he needed no other prompting ."
"his mouth took over the kiss and his hands moved along her body and his lips following where his hands had just touched ."
"when he entered her this time , it was slow and gentle which only drove her more desperately to reach for fulfillment ."
"her fingers raked down his shoulders as she begged him to move faster ."
"when kasar was about to reach his climax , he reached down to help her over the edge , bringing her with him into the oblivion they found yet again ."
"when their heartbeats had slowed , he rolled her over so she was laying across his chest ."
"`` you feel good , '' he said , his hands running down her back , resting on her bottom ."
"`` i probably feel heavy , '' she said , trying to roll off him ."
"but he stopped her , keeping her right where she was ."
"she propped her head on his chest and looked down at him ."
"`` okay , i 'll stay here . ''"
"`` you need more sleep , do n't you ? ''"
"he asked , noticing the dark circles under her eyes ."
"`` not at all , '' she yawned ."
"`` just because you 've kept me up half the night , boring me to death , '' she said , then yelped when he pinched her bottom ."
"she was laughing as he soothed the area , `` you 're a little sensitive in bed , are n't you ? ''"
"`` as if you have something to compare me to , '' he said and his expression became serious ."
"`` why did you try and convince me that you had been with another man ? ''"
"he asked ."
"sarila shrugged and tried to look away but he was n't having any of that ."
"he held her chin and forced her to look at him ."
"`` i do n't recall telling you that i 'd had any experience . ''"
"`` you acted like you had ."
"and do n't even try to deny that you were pushing for that image , '' he said ."
"she laid her head on his chest , her eyes closing slightly ."
"`` it seemed necessary at the time , '' she said , yawning again ."
"she did n't want to think about her reasons right at the moment ."
"she 'd projected an image of herself as loose which would make her unacceptable to be his wife but her reasons now were blurry and did n't seem to matter ."
"her body was sated with his lovemaking and she was seriously wondering why she had fought against this for so long ."
"`` you 're tired ."
"we 'll discuss this later , '' he said and rolled her onto her side ."
"she was already asleep by the time he pulled the sheet up over her naked body ."
"kasar watched her sleep for a long time despite a heavy work load waiting for him in his office ."
"he knew he was supposed to be on vacation but the demands of ruling a kingdom were never far away ."
"he was tempted to lay next to her and simply look at her body relaxed in sleep ."
"but he knew he had several calls to make and people waiting on him to make decisions ."
"with a sigh , he pulled himself out of bed and walked into the shower ."
"but the tiny , slender woman snuggled in his bed would n't leave his mind ."
"he did n't understand her and he wanted to , which was a strange sensation for him ."
"usually women amused him and he enjoyed their company , but he had never spent the whole night with one , preferring to sleep alone ."
"with sarila , he had n't been able to get enough of her ."
"their first time together had been amazing but not nearly satisfying enough ."
"he 'd taken her several more times during the night , each time feeding his need for more of her ."
"but it was n't just sex he wanted from her ."
"first , he wanted an explanation as to why she presented an image to the world of an experienced woman ."
"or was it to the rest of the world ?"
"did she reserve that simply for him ?"
"he smiled at the idea ."
"after their first kiss , he 'd started to suspect that she had n't been with another man ."
"but why had she tried so hard to convince him that she had ?"
"he stepped out of the shower and toweled himself dry , staring at the woman in his bed ."
"she definitely was a mystery ."
"but one he had the rest of his life to figure out , he told himself ."
"he liked that idea ."
"he suspected that he had an uphill battle trying to convince her of that future though ."
"he dressed in casual , khaki slacks and a blue polo shirt , then went to his office , keeping his eyes off of her hair spread out behind her sensuously covering the white sheets ."
"he knew that if he even glanced in her direction , he 'd strip off his clothes and climb right back into bed with her ."
"she would n't get any more sleep and he would n't get his work done ."
"sarila woke up several hours later and looked out the windows again ."
"the sun was no longer near the horizon but was completely overhead ."
"she looked around the room but did n't really expect to see kasar anywhere ."
"she saw the note on the bedside table though and smiled as she reached for it ."
"scrawled in his bold handwriting was a message asking her to let him know when she woke up ."
"he 'd have breakfast or lunch with her ."
"she sat up in bed and looked around the room , pushing her heavy hair off her face and propping her back up against the pillows ."
"sarila had n't really had a chance to see much of the decorating last night but the bright sunlight made the blues and white tones of the room shine ."
"the carpeting was a dark blue and the furniture was done in various shades of blue , ranging from navy to a light blue with white accents ."
"the sheets were white but the cover , which was now on the floor , was a navy blue ."
"she spotted his robe on the floor beside the bed and pulled it on , feeling silly for being so modest after last night ."
"there was something about kasar that just smothered her inhibitions but without him around , she was her usual self conscious self ."
"she showered in his bathroom , not wanting to sneak back to her own room feeling like she did ."
"but she only had the dress she 'd worn last night to put back on ."
"she did so , but quickly made her way to her own room to find some clean clothes that were n't so obviously evening apparel ."
"she knew she was being silly since they were the only two on the ship besides the crew but she could n't help herself ."
"she reached the deck and looked around , hoping to find kasar somewhere ."
"but he was nowhere to be found ."
"she asked a waiter who instantly bowed and said he would relay that she was on deck to kasar ."
"she went into the dining room and found a waiter there ."
"`` i 'm sorry , what time is it ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` it is two o'clock in the afternoon , your highness , '' he bowed ."
"`` i would be happy to get you anything you 'd like to eat , '' he said ."
"sarila smiled gratefully ."
"`` could i just get a sandwich ? ''"
"she asked `` right away , '' he said and disappeared through the doors she now knew led to the kitchen ."
"a moment later , kasar arrived and pulled her into his arms for a kiss ."
"`` good afternoon , sleepy head , '' he said ."
"sarila smiled shyly at him ."
"`` i 'm sorry , i did n't realize it was so late in the day ."
"why did n't you wake me up ? ''"
"he took her hand and pulled her out of the dining room and out onto the deck where he pulled her down onto his lap in the shade ."
"`` because i intend to do the same thing with you tonight that i did to you last night and i wanted you well rested so you ca n't complain . ''"
"she put her arms around his neck and laughed up at his wicked grin ."
"`` i do n't recall complaining last night , '' she said ."
"kasar laughed ."
"`` i love the way you blush when you 're trying to be sophisticated , '' he said and ran a finger over her cheeks ."
"`` are you hungry ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` yes ."
"i asked for a sandwich ."
"it should be ready shortly ."
"have you eaten ? ''"
"`` of course ."
"i was famished this morning ."
"you used up all my energy , '' he said and nibbled on her ear lobe ."
"the waiter arrived and sarila tried to jump up out of his lap , embarrassed to be caught in such a lover-like position ."
"but he held her there and waited while the servant placed the tray of food on the table beside them , then disappeared ."
"`` what have you been doing while i was sleeping ? ''"
"she asked , moving to an empty chair and grabbing half the sandwich ."
"`` i 've been clearing my schedule so i can spend more time with you over the next few days if that 's okay with you , '' he said ."
"sarila smiled ."
"`` i like that idea , '' she replied ."
"`` will our parents hear about it ? ''"
"she asked , worried all of a sudden ."
"`` probably , but since that 's what we 're supposed to be doing , then i do n't think they 'll object . ''"
"`` i 'm thinking about the possibility of them making more into the idea than is really the case . ''"
"kasar laughed ."
"`` i do n't think anything we do will encourage our parents more than they are already encouraged ."
"until we say there 's no hope , they 'll continue to plan our wedding ."
"so let 's just have fun and relax for a few more days and we 'll worry about the future when it arrives , hmm ? ''"
"since it was exactly what she wanted to do , it did n't take much to convince her ."
"`` sounds like a plan , '' she said ."
"`` what 's first on the agenda ? ''"
"he considered her comment for a moment before saying , `` i understand from the captain that we 're close to france ."
"would a stopover in cannes for dinner and dancing fit your idea of a good plan ? ''"
"`` will you dance like you did the other night ? ''"
"she asked , her eyes lighting up at the possibility ."
"he chuckled at her eager expression ."
"`` think you can keep up with me again ? ''"
"he said and leaned down to nibble on her shoulder ."
"`` what if i told you i was taking it easy on you last time ? ''"
"sarila turned more fully to face him ."
"`` then i 'd say you 'd better give me all you got tonight , '' she said , her eyes suggesting more than just dancing ."
"`` i do n't want any holding back ."
"we only have a few more days together ."
"i agree that we should make the most of them . ''"
"`` that 's the spirit , '' he said ."
"they spent the next week making love , sleeping and stopping by whatever port they were passing by ."
"sometimes they would spend the whole day there looking through the town , shopping in the stores or just blending in like tourists , or as much as tourists could blend with several body guards shadowing them ."
"on those days , they would shop and leave right after dusk , falling into bed to make love until the morning ."
"other times , they would stop only for a meal , then the two would spend the afternoon lounging by the pool , reading or working silently beside each other in companionable silence , their hands touching , gently intertwined with each other ."
"she asked him about his education and the things he remembered while he was growing up ."
"sarila then incorporated that information into her lesson plans thinking that if it stands out in one person 's mind as a useful tactic , it might work on the other kids as well ."
"kasar brought some of his work up to the salon where her lesson plans were laid out but if there was a period where he had to work in his office , they would usually discuss the issues he 'd dealt with over dinner ."
"sometimes she would offer him suggestions but most of the time , she just listened to his ideas , impressed with the various ways he dealt with the problems ."
"when he was finished , she 'd talk about her work and the ideas she 'd come up with ."
"usually he laughed and nodded at her ideas , understanding the creativity behind them ."
"if he laughed , she knew she 'd hit upon something the kids would probably like as well ."
"if he grimaced , she tossed the idea back into her bag to refine at a later date ."
"it was the night before they were scheduled to put into abasar and sarila was sitting at the dining room table , just poking at her pasta primavera and barely touching her wine ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"he asked , taking her hand in his ."
"`` you seem upset about something ."
"can you talk about it ? ''"
"sarila tried to smile , but the effort almost made her break down in tears ."
"`` nothing , '' she said , and turned her face away quickly ."
"unfortunately , after spending days and nights in his company , he was too good at reading her emotions ."
"`` it obviously is n't nothing , '' he said and stood up , pulling her up with him and walking into the salon next to the dining room ."
"`` why wo n't you share with me ?"
"i promise i wo n't laugh tonight , '' he said ."
"she rolled her eyes , `` well , i 'm not bringing out anymore hand puppets for you to laugh at , '' she said , placing her hands on his chest as she leaned against his strength , hoping to gain some for herself ."
"`` besides , it is n't really important , '' she said , and played with the buttons on his shirt in an effort to distract him ."
"but he covered up her hands , stopping her ."
"`` sarila , talk to me ."
"tell me what is bothering you . ''"
"she pushed away from him and walked away , crossing her arms over her chest as she stared out at the dark night , the stars glowing brightly like a sequined blanket covering the black waters ."
"`` tomorrow we arrive in abasar , '' she said ."
"`` and ? ''"
"he asked , coming up behind her and pulling her against his chest , his arms wrapping around her waist ."
"`` and , this is the end of you and me ."
"we 'll talk to our parents , tell them that i 'm going back to california and i 'll probably never see you again except in the news . ''"
"`` i doubt that 's going to happen but let 's just take things one day at a time , '' he said and kissed her temple ."
"he was n't about to let her leave his life but he could n't tell her that at the moment ."
"he just had to get her back to abasar and show her how important she was to him and to abasar ."
"he already had a plan in place ."
"he just hoped it would take less than three days ."
"kasar nibbled on her ear lobe ."
"`` you 're not leaving immediately , remember ?"
"you still owe me three days , '' he said she smiled at the reminder ."
"`` and you owe the kids at the youth center a whole lot of musical instruments , '' she laughed , wiping away a tear than fell onto her cheek as inconspicuously as possible ."
"he caught her movement and turned her around so he could see her face ."
"`` sarila , why are you crying ? ''"
"he asked , his thumb moving across her damp cheek ."
"his gentle touch was her undoing ."
"she could n't stop the tears after that ."
"`` do n't ask questions , '' she said and pulled herself up against his body , moving against him as he 'd taught her , showing him how much she wanted him right now , immediately ."
"`` like you said , let 's just live for the moment . ''"
"he wanted to question her further but she had been too good of a student over the past few days ."
"she used everything he 'd taught her to distract him with her body and her hands , moving against him , stepping away and unbuttoning her dress , revealing her lace bra that barely covered anything ."
"kasar groaned and reached out to touch her breast , his fingertip moving down between the center , then rubbing along the bottom , knowing it would drive her mad ."
"`` we have to talk about this , sarila , '' he said stepping back and shaking his head ."
"`` later , '' she said and let the dress slip down her shoulders ."
"`` just make love with me , '' she said ."
"kasar could n't stop ."
"he wanted her just as badly now ."
"he lifted her up so her breast was at the same height as his mouth ."
"`` wrap your legs around my waist , '' he ordered ."
"when she did , he nuzzled the scrap of bra out of his way and took her nipple in his mouth ."
"as she moaned , gripping his hair and holding his head against her body , he nipped at her nipple , changing the moan to a cry of pleasure so intense , she arched her back and writhed in his strong arms ."
"he carried her to the salon next to the dining room , their dinner forgotten as their passion took over ."
"he sat down on the sofa , her legs straddling his hips ."
"he quickly unlatched her bra and pulled her other breast into his mouth for the same attention ."
"sarila was busy working the buttons on his shirt but when she could n't get the small buttons undone , she finally just pulled it out of his pants and yanked it over his head ."
"she heard a few buttons ping against the wall but did n't care ."
"she guessed he had plenty of shirts and someone would be able to fix his buttons later ."
"she was too desperate to feel his chest against hers and run her fingers over the muscles in his arms and back ."
"he stood her up in front of him and pulled her underwear off ."
"`` sit down , '' he said , his eyes heated with desire ."
"`` should n't you take off your pants ? ''"
"she asked , but she was already moving to do as he 'd ordered ."
"she bent down to take off her shoes , but he stopped her ."
"he pulled her down so her legs were straddling his hips ."
"`` just lean back , '' he said and took her nipple in his mouth again then spread his legs wider , effectively opening her up for his touch ."
"`` kasar ? ''"
"she said , her breath coming in gasps ."
"`` trust me , '' he said and his hands moved down her thighs , lightly touching her as his mouth moved to her other breast again ."
"his fingers moved along her inner thighs now but not coming near to her core , where her body was desperate to feel his touch ."
"she moved toward his fingers , knowing he could satisfy her but unsure how to tell him to do it ."
"`` please , '' she said , her hands on his shoulders and her nails digging into his skin ."
"`` relax , '' he said ."
"`` i ca n't ."
"i ca n't , '' she whimpered , holding his head to her breast ."
"his fingers finally touched her , moving slowly inside her , his thumb flicking her nub and she cried out , desperate for more ."
"`` kasar please , help me , '' she said , her body unable to move with his legs spread out ."
"she was his captive and completely at his mercy ."
"his fingers moved again and she moaned , already feeling the climax coming over her ."
"with just one more flick and she was over the edge , crying out as the release came ."
"when she had recovered slightly , she looked up at him , her eyes still glazed with desire ."
"`` you 're going to pay for that , '' she said and stepped off him ."
"`` i hope so , '' he said and watched in fascination as she stood in front of him , then knelt between his legs ."
"she slid his belt off , tossing it behind her , not caring where it landed ."
"`` stand up , '' she said , kneeling down in front of him ."
"he did as she ordered and she undid the button at his waist , then slid the zipper down , slowly ."
"once she had the zipper down , she slid his slacks and boxers down his legs ."
"`` sit down , '' she said and was then able to toss his slacks behind her as well ."
"she licked her lips as she took in his erection ."
"her hands wrapped around him and she considered all the possibilities ."
"without hesitation , she took him in her mouth , enjoying the sound of his indrawn breath as she licked and touched him , feeling all of her feminine power as he groaned and put his hands in her hair ."
"but he was stronger than she and , when he 'd had enough , he pulled her up ."
"`` come here , '' he said and lifted her so she was straddling him again ."
"`` sarila , '' he said , his voice was harsh as he entered her , filling her up and moving her to his rhythm ."
"sarila had enjoyed the power while it lasted but she also liked it when he took over , filling her up and bringing her body alive once again ."
"his fingers coaxed her to his point , then the two of them crashed over the edge of bliss together ."
"once they had caught their breath , he stood up with her in his arms and carried her to his stateroom ."
"there , he laid her down in the center of the bed , then laid down beside her ."
"they made love until the early hours of the morning ."
"when they had filled themselves with each other , they fell asleep , holding each other as closely as possible , sarila using his arm as her pillow while one of his hands rested on her breast , the other against her bottom ."
"she woke the next morning still curled up in his arms but something was different ."
"she was n't sure what it could be ."
"`` do n't move , '' he said , his mouth against her neck ."
"she turned to look down at him and he sighed , pulling her against him ."
"`` you are not a very obedient woman , did you know that ? ''"
"he said and kissed her ear , causing her to giggle and try to move away from him ."
"`` kasar , stop , '' she gasped ."
"`` something is wrong , '' she said , pushing against his shoulders ."
"he stopped and looked at her ."
"`` what 's wrong ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` i do n't know , '' she said , listening ."
"`` i do n't hear anything , '' she said , her whole body tensing ."
"`` we 're docked , '' he confirmed ."
"`` we are ? ''"
"she said , the tears instantly coming to her eyes ."
"`` do n't start that , '' he said and kissed her closed eyelids ."
"`` remember , we still have three days together ."
"and you promised me that you 'd take it moment by moment ."
"do n't mar the next three days with dread over your departure , '' he said , pulling her under his large body and pulling her hands over her head ."
"`` you 're right , '' she sighed , then gasped as his erection pressed against her own body ."
"`` kasar ? ''"
"she asked , smiling and then arching as he filled her up , moving slowly inside her ."
"`` kasar ! ''"
"she said , already nearing her climax ."
"he pulled her in and sent her over the edge , quickly following her as he moaned out his own climax ."
"he then collapsed on top of her ."
"`` you 're going to kill me , i 'm sure of it . ''"
"when she could catch her breath and speak again , she looked up at him ."
"`` i 'm going to kill you ? ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` i was having a nice little pity party and the next thing i know , you 're ... . ''"
"she still could n't talk about the sexual act , her face flaming with color ."
"`` well , you know . ''"
"kasar laughed deeply ."
"`` yes , my shy one ."
"i know , '' he said and stood up , gloriously naked and completely unconcerned ."
"he bent down and picked her up , carrying her into the bathroom ."
"`` our parents are probably anxious to see both of us , yours especially ."
"we need to get moving . ''"
"the idea of seeing her parents again spurred sarila into fast mode ."
"she showered and changed into a pretty dress , adding a short sleeved sweater over the top ."
"she brushed her hair until it shined , then applied only a small amount of powder , mascara and a dab of lipstick ."
"since she 'd moved most of her clothes into kadar 's room at his order , she smiled as he came up behind her , wrapping his arms around her waist ."
"`` you 're beautiful , '' he said and kissed her bare shoulder ."
"`` you 're parents will be proud of the woman you turned out to be , '' he said and looked at her in the mirror ."
"`` thank you , '' she said , moved by his praise ."
"`` come on , '' she said , breaking the moment and grabbing his hand to pull him out of the bathroom ."
"`` how long does it take to get to the palace from here ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"`` do n't you want some breakfast ? ''"
"he asked , laughing as she rushed up the stairs ."
"but he hurried behind her , understanding her eagerness to see her parents after so many years ."
"`` oh , i 'm sorry , '' she said , her face falling as she looked back at him ."
"`` you 're probably hungry ."
"of course , we can stop and eat breakfast ."
"that was very selfish of me , '' she said and moved into the dining room ."
"he grabbed her hand and shook his head ."
"`` i understand that you 're excited to see your parents ."
"it 's an hour 's drive to the palace ."
"that 's why i 've arranged for a helicopter to take us there , '' he said and she heard the whipping of the blades in the distance as he spoke ."
"`` there 's also a thermos of coffee already on board ."
"we 'll be at the palace in less than twenty minutes , '' he said ."
"sarila was humbled by his thoughtfulness ."
"she reached up and touched his cheek , then rose on her toes to kiss him gently on his lips ."
"`` thank you , '' she said simply ."
"within five minutes , they were comfortably seated in a luxurious helicopter that was so well insulated , they were able to converse with each other inside without the need for a radio and ear phones ."
"she sipped her thermos of coffee and alternated between watching the land fly by below and kasar as he ate a biscuit and sipped his own coffee ."
"he spoke on a cell phone to someone but she was n't listening to his conversation ."
"his voice held the tinge of absolute authority as did the lines of his face and the confidence in his body ."
"she was considering how wonderful it would be to spend the rest of her life with him , to know more days like the past week , give him children and grow old with him ."
"the thought almost brought the tears back to her ."
"would it be so bad to spend her life with him ?"
"she thought of her parent 's marriage and she knew that was not what she wanted from a marriage ."
"she wanted to love kasar and be loved in return ."
"was kasar capable of loving her ?"
"they 'd never spoken of their feelings for each other but she knew that she was completely , desperately in love with him ."
"there was no way she could have made love with him and not been in love as well ."
"sarila was not able to separate her emotions into nice , neat little buckets ."
"and even so , was loving each other enough ?"
"her parents fought like cats and dogs at times ."
"she hated the constant fighting her mother and father did with each other ."
"they seemed to love each other when they were n't fighting ."
"their love even seemed very passionate ."
"but then one of them would prick the other 's temper and they would be off again , yelling and screaming , throwing their hands up at each other 's arguments ."
"and the arguments never seemed to be for things that were substantial ."
"usually they were silly things that had happened during the day that would spark an argument ."
"sarila knew that she had too much of her mother inside of her to keep quiet when she disagreed with something ."
"there would n't be peace if she stayed with kasar since she would voice her opinions regardless of the consequences ."
"no , kasar needed someone who would be able to agree with him more , who would help him rule abasar ."
"she wished she could be that person , but he probably already had someone in mind ."
"he definitely would n't want her who had run away at the first sign of frustration and lived out her life in a foreign country , seeming to reject everything that she 'd been brought up to believe in ."
"he 'd find a perfectly bred woman in abasar who would respect his commands and follow orders complacently , not challenge them ."
"the thought of another woman giving him children caused actual physical pain in her heart ."
"she did n't want to think about it , so she just changed the way her mind was thinking ."
"she had three more days with him ."
"and three more nights ."
"she would make the most of that time and savor each moment and experience with him she told herself as she watched the desert fly by underneath the powerful helicopter ."
"the helicopter landed inside the palace gates ."
"a servant immediately opened the helicopter doors and helped sarila down the steps ."
"through the wind whipping her long , black hair , she saw her parents standing at the end of the pathway and ran to them , the tears already streaming down her face ."
"her mother met her halfway and they locked arms , neither willing to relinquish the other as they hugged , desperate after six year 's separation ."
"`` i 'm so sorry i ran away , '' she said to her mother softly ."
"`` hush , dear , '' nadia said , stepping back and touching her daughter 's face gently with her hands , wiping the tears from her cheeks ."
"`` i understand ."
"besides , you 're home now ."
"that 's what is important , '' she said and gazed at her daughter with unconditional love only a parent could offer ."
"`` any room in those arms for your father ? ''"
"padim said , his voice gruff with emotion ."
"sarila laughed and turned to her tall , handsome father ."
"`` dad ! ''"
"she said and reached out to hug him as well ."
"the tears flowed even harder as his strong arms pulled her into his gentle embrace ."
"`` we missed you , daughter , '' he said , his eyes closed tightly over his own emotion ."
"when he released her , he stood up and looked behind her ."
"`` thank you , kasar ."
"i did n't think you could bring her home , but i 'm grateful . ''"
"sarila was amazed at the deep emotion her father was displaying in front of kasar ."
"usually her father was the epitome of restraint while in public so this was an astounding moment ."
"kasar bowed slightly to her father who returned the action more deeply ."
"`` it was my pleasure , '' he said and smiled at sarila ."
"`` i 'll see you later ? ''"
"he asked , winking at her as she wiped at her tears ."
"sarila laughed and nodded her head ."
"`` yes ."
"i 'd like that , '' she said ."
"he took her hand and kissed her knuckles ."
"`` until later then , '' he said and nodded to her mother , then her father before walking off into the palace ."
"sarila watched him leave , loving the confidence that emanated from him with his every move ."
"`` well , '' nadia said , interrupting sarila 's thoughts ."
"`` let 's get inside ."
"we have a lot of catching up to do and , from what i understand , you have n't eaten yet today , '' her mother said , looking at her daughter 's slender form ."
"`` you 've lost a few pounds in the past two weeks , i can see , '' she said ."
"`` you can ? ''"
"sarila asked , looking down at her figure as well but not noticing any difference ."
"then kadar 's revelation that she 'd been a subject of daily reports for years came back to her ."
"`` oh , i guess the reports included pictures as well as text , eh ? ''"
"her father nodded ."
"`` absolutely ."
"and if you ever decide you need to run away again , could you at least give us a heads up ?"
"it was very difficult to find you initially , '' he said and put an arm around her shoulder , guiding both women inside to a private dining room that already had a buffet table heavily laden with brunch foods on it ."
"sarila was n't fooled for a minute ."
"after the shock of finding out that he 'd had her followed for the past six years , she now understood that he would n't have let her out of his sight for very long even when she was at the palace ."
"`` how long did it take your security detail to find me ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` a full twenty four hours ? ''"
"shaking his head at what must have been a difficult memory , `` more like five , but who can remember ? ''"
"he said ."
"`` i can ."
"it was four hours , thirty seven minutes , '' nadia interrupted ."
"`` they were the worst hours of my life , '' she said ."
"`` we thought someone had kidnapped you , '' she said , shuddering and waving her hand as if the action could erase the memory from her mind ."
"`` did n't you get my note ? ''"
"sarila asked , instantly guilty about the worry her parents probably went through if only for a few hours ."
"even that was too long since her parents had been wonderful throughout her life ."
"she hated the thought of causing them any amount of worry , even if it was only for four hours ."
"nadia nodded ."
"`` of course , but forgeries are easy to do , '' she said and handed sarila a plate filled with eggs , toast and fresh fruit ."
"`` sit down and tell us everything you 've done for the past six years ."
"leave nothing out , '' she said ."
"`` i thought you knew everything , '' sarila laughed , delighted with the idea of being within the security of her parents ' arms again ."
"she 'd forgotten how nice it was to be around her mother 's worrying and her father 's arrogance ."
"`` it is n't like hearing it from you ."
"now talk , '' she said sitting down next to her daughter and placing her chin on the open palm of her hand , completely ignoring her own plate of food , preferring to keep her eyes on her daughter ."
"they spent several hours talking and catching up with each other ."
"sarila told them about finalizing her education through university , her teaching job and her kids at the youth center and her own classes ."
"she described each of the small little beings as if they were her own and all the little antics they tried to play on her ."
"she was delighted to announce that kasar had generously donated to the procurement of an additional teacher and extra instruments after losing the bet on the cookie endeavor ."
"both her parents laughed at the idea of kasar in the kitchen trying to cook and sarila only left out the details of him kissing her but described the whole event otherwise ."
"once she 'd talked herself out , she asked for updates on her parents and what was happening in their lives ."
"her father had made many changes in his domain and they talked about the quality of life he 'd brought to his people ."
"the conversation slowly turned from them to the changes in abasar ."
"that inevitably led to the questions concerning kasar and their relationship ."
"neither of her parents mentioned the betrothal contract and sarila decided it was better to break the news with kasar present to support her claim that the wedding just was n't meant to be ."
"`` you look tired , '' her mother said when sarila smothered a yawn ."
"`` why do n't i take you to your quarters and you can take a nap ."
"there 's a big celebration tonight in your honor , '' her mother announced as they walked down the hallway ."
"she opened the doors to a huge suite but sarila was too tired to notice the elaborate and beautifully decorated set of rooms ."
"`` i 'll send someone to help you dress in a few hours , '' her mother said before closing the doors ."
"she noticed that her luggage had already been delivered to her room and emptied , her clothes hanging in the closet or in the drawers along the side of the beautiful room ."
"sarila took off her dress and pulled on a tee-shirt ."
"she did n't even bother to get between the sheets ."
"after a night of making love with kasar , she was too tired for that so she simply pulled the coverlet over her legs and closed her eyes ."
"within moments , she was asleep ."
"she woke a few hours later when she heard someone coming into her room and quietly leaving ."
"she watched as a servant placed a dress on a hook by a large wardrobe , then left just as quietly as she 'd come ."
"sarila sat up and looked at the beautiful dress that the maid had left ."
"it was made of fabric that could only be described as metallic , but it was n't gold or silver ."
"it seemed to change as the light shifted ."
"it was strapless with a fitted bodice ."
"the skirt was made of layer upon layer of the softest material she 'd ever touched ."
"as she lifted one layer , it seemed to float down onto the next layer , gently skimming the fabric below ."
"she smiled , eager to try on the dress ."
"if only there were wings , she would look like a fairy in one of her favorite childhood books ."
"someone knocked on the door and she turned to answer it ."
"`` good evening , your highness ."
"i was sent to do your hair if you need assistance , '' a petite , round woman said , speaking in arabic ."
"sarila considered the option for all of five seconds before accepting ."
"she had n't had someone to do her hair since she 'd left the palace so many years ago and she 'd forgotten the little luxuries palace life afforded her ."
"`` oh , that would be lovely , '' sarila said and stepped back to let the woman into the room ."
"the woman stepped back out of the room and then back in , this time carrying a large case that looked something like a tool chest ."
"she walked over to the dressing table and smiled , indicating that sarila should sit down ."
"as soon as the woman noticed her tee-shirt , she stopped and placed her comb against her mouth , considering sarila 's attire for a moment ."
"`` perhaps you should change into a robe instead of the shirt ."
"it might mess up the hair later when you pull it over your head . ''"
"sarila agreed and walked to the closet , not at all surprised to find even more clothes than the ones she 'd brought and kasar had purchased for her ."
"in addition to her own clothes and the clothes that had been on the ship , she was staring at a huge closet full of the most beautiful clothes she 'd ever seen ."
"and they were all in her size with the tags still on them ."
"she guessed that her parents had been the instigators of that shopping spree ."
"or more specifically , her mother who loved shopping and took pride in never wearing the same outfit twice ."
"her mother was the ultimate diplomat 's wife , knowing how to charm anyone and what to wear to just about any occasion ."
"sarila pushed the enormous number of new clothes around , searching for a robe ."
"her face flamed to a bright red color when she came to the end of the closet ."
"she found about ten nightgowns , all in the most revealing fabrics and cuts ."
"if her father had seen these , she was sure he 'd have them shredded ."
"would her mother have purchased these as well ?"
"probably , she decided ."
"all in the hope of sarila 's honeymoon ."
"there was also the possibility that kasar had purchased them as well , but when would he have done so ?"
"definitely not on the ship , she knew since she 'd spent so much time with him ."
"and he would have told her if he 'd sent someone to purchase anything else for her ."
"so it had to be her mother 's optimism coming through ."
"knowing she would need to have a firm talk with her parents soon and break the news to them that the wedding was n't going to happen , she slipped her arms into a peach , silk robe , then belted the sash at her waist ."
"`` i guess this will work , '' sarila said , coming out of the closet ."
"the little lady , who called herself `` tasha '' nodded her head ."
"as soon as sarila sat down , the woman started brushing her hair , her expert hands running through the long , black locks and considering the options ."
"`` is that the gown you will be wearing tonight ? ''"
"tasha asked , indicating the fabulous , mysterious gown hanging from the hook near the closet ."
"`` apparently , '' sarila said , eyeing the gown in the mirror ."
"`` i have no idea what to do with my hair in that kind of a gown so use your best judgment . ''"
"sarila generally did n't know what to do with her hair on a day to day basis so she usually just let it flow down her back , only occasionally trying something different ."
"an hour later , sarila looked at her reflection in the mirror ."
"tasha had done an elaborate twist that had her hair flowing down the back , then curling in every direction ."
"it was both elegant and romantic without being overwhelming or heavy ."
"sarila 's eyes widened in wonder that she was the same person she was an hour ago ."
"surely the sophisticated woman sitting in front of the mirror was someone else ?"
"`` tasha , you 're an artist , '' sarila said , turning her head in several directions so she could see the total effect , then smiling in anticipation of kasar seeing her like this ."
"tasha stayed to help sarila pull on the dress ."
"when sarila looked at her reflection in the mirror , she felt like a different person ."
"she looked special , excited ... royal ."
"she heard another knock on the door and hurried to answer it , hoping it would be kasar and she could have a few moments alone with him ."
"unfortunately , it was her mother and father , both of whom looked at her with pride in their eyes as soon as they saw her dressed up ."
"`` you look lovely tonight ."
"this will be your night to shine , '' nadia gasped , giving her a kiss on her cheek ."
"`` your mother is right , '' her father said , his chest puffing up with pride ."
"`` you look like a princess . ''"
"the three of them walked down the hallway and were met by the king and queen but sarila was frustrated that she still had n't seen kasar ."
"she greeted the king and queen with reverence , genuinely respecting the two people who had been like an aunt and uncle to her while growing up ."
"they both greeted her as if she were a long lost daughter , then the five of them walked into the main salon for a toast before the party was to begin ."
"as soon as they walked into the salon , she saw him and she instantly felt better ."
"kasar stood at the window , looking out into the night as if he had some deep and awful thoughts on his mind ."
"when the door opened , he turned and saw her and his features froze ."
"it was almost as if he 'd stopped breathing as he looked across the room at her ."
"suddenly , he was moving and his eyes never left her face ."
"before he reached her , he seemed to realize that they were not alone and his walk stiffened ."
"he still walked over to her and took her hand in his , tucking it into the crook of his arm to finish walking her into the room ."
"he pulled her slightly off to the side and bent to whisper in her ear , `` you look incredibly lovely , '' he said , his breath warm on her cheek and sending shivers down her spine ."
"`` but i prefer the way you looked this morning , '' he said , winking at her as her cheeks turned a becoming color of pink ."
"he then moved out from in front of her as kadar 's father raised a glass of champagne in toast ."
"`` to sarila and kasar , '' he began , `` may their marriage be prosperous and productive , giving abasar the next king , '' he said ."
"`` to sarila and kasar , '' he repeated ."
"sarila 's mother and father raised their glasses in toast , then sipped their drinks ."
"sarila could n't think , she just held her champagne glass in the air , her whole body stiffening as the meaning of their words hit her ."
"`` i 'm sorry , what do you mean ? ''"
"she asked ."
"nadia smiled excitedly , `` dear , this is your engagement party ."
"everyone is arriving to greet you and welcome you home as well as offer their congratulations on your upcoming wedding . ''"
"the world started to spin and she had to hold onto kadar 's arm in order to keep herself from falling backwards or screaming at everyone ."
"was it just on her face that she wanted kasar so much ?"
"or were they making assumptions ?"
"was she making a fool of herself ?"
"did kasar see her feelings on her face as well ?"
"sarila did n't know what to do ."
"she wanted him desperately , but not the marriage part ."
"she was n't strong enough to make it work with him ."
"she did n't know how to be a good wife and her love for him simply would n't be enough to sustain them ."
"her fingers must have triggered kasar because he put down his glass of champagne and turned to face her ."
"he quickly led her several feet away so they would n't be overhead ."
"`` sarila , look at me , '' he said urgently ."
"her worried eyes slowly traveled up his tuxedo clad chest to rest on his reassuring eyes ."
"`` do you trust me ? ''"
"he asked , loud enough so only she could hear ."
"she did n't respond quickly , too overwhelmed by the words everyone had just said ."
"`` how could they have planned this party without even talking to us ?"
"did n't you tell them that we were going to try and end this betrothal ? ''"
"she asked ."
"his eyes were dark and intense as they looked down into hers before replying ."
"`` i did n't know they were planning an engagement party for us but i did n't talk to them either ."
"i did n't have any time nor did i anticipate the need to do so ."
"but it does n't matter ."
"what they do has no impact on what we do ."
"do you trust me ? ''"
"he repeated ."
"she looked into his strong face , knowing that he would take care of things ."
"he was so strong and confident ."
"`` yes , '' she said and her body relaxed ."
"she even managed a smile to reassure him ."
"`` yes , i trust you , '' she said again , as much for herself as for him ."
"`` good , '' he said and sarila wondered if she 'd seen the tension leave his features or if it had just been her imagination ."
"`` then let 's have a good time tonight ."
"you 'll be able to see some of your old friends and we can just get through the night until we can be alone together ."
"can you do that for me ? ''"
"hope rose in her and she glanced up eagerly into his handsome face ."
"`` do you promise we 'll be alone ? ''"
"she whispered ."
"`` how can we ?"
"there were so many guards and there are so many other guests here . ''"
"he smiled down at her , his eyes alight with mischief ."
"`` let me worry about that , okay ?"
"you worry about how you 're going to get enough sleep , '' he teased ."
"he turned around and found that his parents were talking with sarila 's parents , giving them some privacy ."
"but as soon as he turned around , so did they , instantly including them back in the conversation ."
"`` everything okay ? ''"
"the king asked , looking at the two of them ."
"`` yes ."
"everything is fine , '' kasar said , his voice strong and reassuring ."
"sarila held onto his arm as if he were a lifeline and the six of them moved into the ballroom together to greet the guests who had just started arriving ."
"they formed a receiving line and sarila was excited to see several of her old school mates ."
"she introduced kasar to each of them and she was thrilled when each of them introduced her to their husbands ."
"once the arriving guests dwindled down to a slow trickle , they moved into the ballroom ."
"the orchestra struck up a waltz and all eyes turned toward the king and queen who normally initiated the first dance ."
"but the king turned to kasar , allowing him the honor of starting the dancing for the night ."
"kasar turned to sarila who smiled up at him , then took his hand and let him guide her out onto the dance floor ."
"`` this is thoroughly terrifying , '' she said but kept her smile on her face , looking to all the other people as if they were discussing the weather or something equally benign ."
"he shrugged his shoulders , `` you 'll get used to it , '' he laughed ."
"`` just pretend we 're back on the ship and no one else is looking on . ''"
"an hysterical giggle threatened to burst out of her system but she suppressed it as quickly as possible ."
"ignore the hundreds of guests watching them ?"
"how was she supposed to do that ?"
"`` i do n't think that is going to work , kasar , '' she laughed softly ."
"`` i can see them out of the corner of my eyes ."
"it is n't the same . ''"
"he pulled her closer and spun her to the right , throwing her slightly off balance enough so she had to lean into him ."
"she was sure he did that on purpose but she did n't mind since his next words were too outrageous ."
"`` then pretend they are all in their underwear , '' he whispered in a naughty voice ."
"`` i 'm picturing you in yours , '' he said ."
"her mouth opened slightly at that thought and she laughed ."
"`` it is a good image but i only like you in yours ."
"or not , '' she said and glanced away ."
"kasar threw back his head and laughed ."
"`` that 's the spirit , '' he said ."
"`` you 're doing great ."
"and it is almost over ."
"i can see my father leading my mom out onto the floor ."
"once they join in , the rest of the people will also come out ."
"then we 'll be off display , '' he explained , a teasing glint in his eyes as he looked down at her ."
"`` i remember watching these functions from the balcony up there , '' she said , nodding her head to several balconies that looked down onto the ballroom ."
"`` i 'd hide behind the thick curtains and watch everyone dancing and laughing , wishing i was old enough to come down . ''"
"`` how old were you ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` oh , i guess i was about ten or eleven when i was finally able to even stay awake late enough to watch ."
"one time , my mother found me asleep in the curtains . ''"
"`` i remember hearing about that ."
"i thought it was cute . ''"
"`` cute ?"
"i was a little girl asleep on the cold marble floor and you thought i was cute ?"
"i was pathetic . ''"
"`` i did n't think so ."
"and if i remember accurately , i was also jealous , '' he said and spun her around again , casually leading her off the dance floor and out into the balcony that looked down on the gardens a few steps away ."
"`` jealous of me ? ''"
"she asked , laughing at the very idea ."
"`` i doubt it ."
"and i bet you barely knew i was around , '' she said , remembering the ache of jealousy she felt each time she 'd caught him wooing another female out here in these gardens ."
"`` yes ."
"i was jealous because you got to sleep when i was stuck in the ballroom with boring people hanging onto me . ''"
"she did n't answer him because yet another group of people moved in to congratulate them ."
"true to his word , kasar kept up the line he 'd been saying all night whenever someone asked about their wedding date or details ."
"`` the details have n't all been worked out yet , '' he explained ."
"that was the last time they were actually alone that night ."
"it was almost two o'clock in the morning when kasar realized that she was practically sleeping on her feet ."
"he excused the two of them and walked her to her room ."
"once there , she looked up at him ."
"`` you 're not coming to me tonight , are you ? ''"
"she said , already frustrated despite her exhaustion ."
"`` do you want me to ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she sighed and shook her head ."
"`` no ."
"i know you 're just as tired as i am . ''"
"she tried to hide her disappointment at losing one night with him but he forced her chin up so he could see into her eyes ."
"`` if you 're trying to be selfless for me , just stop right there , '' he said quietly ."
"`` if it were up to me , i 'd be pulling you into my arms right now and carrying you off to bed ."
"it might be just to sleep but i would n't care ."
"i want you by my side ."
"i 've gotten used to your sweet body next to mine . ''"
"`` really ? ''"
"she said , her smile growing as he spoke ."
"`` really ."
"let me go back to the party and excuse myself and i 'll be back . ''"
"`` how ?"
"there are guards everywhere ."
"surely they 'll see and will report to our parents , '' she said , looking down the hallway where a sentry passed by , appropriately averting his eyes when he noticed them and walked down the hallway ."
"`` i told you , leave that to me , '' he said and kissed her gently ."
"she slipped into her room and closed the door softly behind her ."
"there were only soft lights still on when she walked in and someone had already turned down her bed for the night ."
"sarila slipped her dress off and hung it up in the closet ."
"she took one of the silk nightgowns down and slipped it on over her body , loving the way the fabric felt against her skin ."
"she climbed into bed , leaving the light beside her bed on for kasar ."
"within moments , she was asleep ."
"she barely even noticed when kasar slipped in beside her but she turned and curled into his arms , sighing his name as she fell completely asleep again ."
"chapter 9 sarila woke the next day , feeling slightly depressed ."
"she would have sworn that kasar had been with her last night but she was alone now ."
"when she rolled over , she saw the indentation on the pillow and smiled ."
"he had been here last night , she thought to herself ."
"she jumped out of bed and showered , dressing in a pair of pretty silk pants and a white cotton shirt ."
"she felt like a tough , pretty woman ."
"sarila ate breakfast with her mother and father , both of whom plied her with questions about her life in the united states , her job , her friends but diplomatically leaving out an interrogation of her feelings for kasar and why she panicked the previous night when she found out that the party was an engagement party ."
"`` was n't all this included in the daily reports ? ''"
"sarila teased ."
"her mother nodded her head , not ashamed at all to have been caught ."
"`` of course but as i mentioned yesterday , those reports were nothing compared to hearing you talk about it ."
"i missed six years of having you come home from school and talk to me over cookies and milk so do n't even try it , sarila , '' she admonished but with a warm glint in her eyes ."
"they spent the next two hours talking about what had happened over the past six years and sarila started to feel the old closeness she 'd had with her parents growing up ."
"it was the middle of the morning when the note arrived ."
"sarila was telling her parents about all her students over the past school year and the upcoming summer youth programs when a servant delivered the note from kasar ."
"she blushed when her mother raised an eyebrow ."
"`` i 'm sure it is nothing , '' sarila said but she tore open the seal , eager to see his words ."
"the night was unsatisfying , sleepy head ."
"can you meet me in my office at 11:30 ?"
"i have an important issue to discuss with you ."
"k. sarila smiled at his bold handwriting ."
"she glanced at her watch , then at her parents who were both smiling and enjoying the look of pleasure on their daughter 's face ."
"she tried to cover the excitement that formed within her but she knew she was failing miserably ."
"`` he just wants to discuss something with me , '' she said ."
"`` do n't make too much of a note , '' she warned ."
"`` we 're not even considering the note , dear , '' her mother said and took her husband 's hands in hers ."
"`` then why are you looking so strangely at me ? ''"
"`` it was the look of joy on your face when you read the note ."
"and the slight touch of color to your cheeks ."
"that color would n't have anything to do with the fact that kasar was walking down your hallway around dawn this morning , would it ? ''"
"sarila saw the confused look on her father 's face ."
"`` what was he doing in that area of the palace ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"`` probably nothing , '' her mother said , not turning her attention away from her daughter 's face ."
"`` probably ? ''"
"he asked again ."
"`` he was n't coming out of sarila 's room , was he ? ''"
"`` that 's none of our business , '' she said and winked at her daughter ."
"her father was having none of this evasiveness ."
"`` nadia !"
"you will tell me what is going on and you 'll tell me right this minute , '' he ordered ."
"nadia sighed and turned in her husband 's arms , placing a calming hand over his chest ."
"`` i 'll tell you everything i know as soon as we hear what was in the note from kasar . ''"
"`` there is n't anything to tell , '' sarila lied and stood up as quickly as she could so her parents would n't see the truth on her face ."
"`` i came back from the party last night and fell asleep ."
"i do n't even remember my head hitting the pillow . ''"
"with those words , she pulled the heavy door open and slipped out of the salon ."
"she stopped the first servant she could find to ask directions to kasar 's office ."
"as soon as they told her , she remembered the way and rushed along the ornately decorated hallways toward the office section of the palace ."
"the assistant outside kadar 's office stood as soon as she entered and told her to go right into the office ."
"sarila knocked , just in case , then pushed the door open ."
"she spotted him at the head of a long table filled with older men ."
"all of them were shouting in arabic and no one was really listening ."
"she noted that kasar just sat at the head and listened , but she could tell he was n't really paying attention to their words ."
"as soon as he saw her , he smiled and leaned forward ."
"`` gentlemen , i 'm sure this debate could go on and on ."
"everyone has some very good points and they should all be discussed ."
"but perhaps we should adjourn for now and come back when we 've talked through the issues with each other in less formal settings , '' he suggested ."
"all the men nodded and started closing their notebooks , sliding their chairs out from the table ."
"sarila stepped into the room when kasar waved to her and the men bowed slightly to her as they filed out in twos and threes ."
"kasar walked over to his desk and waited until they were alone ."
"`` close the door , sarila , '' he said and watched as she turned to follow his direction ."
"`` and ? ''"
"she asked , leaning against the door and waiting for his next instruction ."
"`` come here , sleepy head , '' he said and crossed his arms over his chest ."
"`` i do n't think last night was my fault , '' she said saucily as she walked over to the opposite side of his desk ."
"`` i think you were just too tired to wake me up and now you 're blaming me for your lack of stamina , '' she whispered , leaning over the desk provocatively ."
"`` say that on this side of the desk , '' he growled , leaning slightly over his side his eyes taking in her flashing eyes and gamin grin ."
"but because the desk was so large , they were n't even close to each other ."
"she walked around the corner , her eyes never leaving his laughing ones ."
"`` i 'm not afraid of you , '' she said ."
"`` good , '' kasar said and waited until she was only a few inches away ."
"then he quickly grabbed her , placed her onto his desk and bent her over his arm , his chest touching hers as he bent her backwards , `` because i 'm going to kiss you right here , '' he said ."
"`` oh , '' was all she had time to get out before his mouth descended to hers ."
"his free hand slid under her shirt and moved upwards , his thumb skimming the lace underneath ."
"after several minutes though , he pulled away and reset her shirt so it was n't as obvious that he had been kissing her and touching her beautiful skin ."
"`` you 're dangerous to my concentration , woman , '' he said and stepped back from the desk ."
"`` as it happens , that was n't why i asked you to come see me , '' he said ."
"sarila laughed , delighted that she was able to break his concentration so easily ."
"`` what did you have on your mind ? ''"
"`` besides you 're delectable body ? ''"
"he said , grinning wolfishly toward her as she sat down in his large , leather chair as if she owned the office herself ."
"`` of course , '' she laughed and was impressed when he leaned against his desk , not threatened by her taking over his comfortable chair ."
"her father had never let her mother sit in his office chair and until this moment , she had n't realized that she 'd been testing for a reaction ."
"and he 'd passed with flying colors ."
"`` i want to propose something to you , '' he said ."
"sarila instantly stiffened ."
"was he going to propose ?"
"what would she say ?"
"an instant yes popped into her head and she had to look away to hide the yearning in her eyes ."
"`` what 's that ? ''"
"she asked , and could have hit herself for the breathless quality of her voice ."
"`` i want to give you an assignment . ''"
"`` what kind of assignment ? ''"
"she asked , her eyes still glancing away , fearful that he would ask and terrified that he would n't ."
"`` would you consider spending a couple of hours traveling to the various schools within the city and observing their processes and classes ?"
"i was hoping you could give me some advice on how to improve the school system ."
"you have some great ideas and as an objective observer , i think you could provide some valuable feedback . ''"
"sarila stood up and turned her back on him , fearful that he would see the disappointment on her face ."
"that was all he wanted from her ?"
"her professional opinion ?"
"`` sarila ? ''"
"he asked when she did n't respond ."
"`` are you okay ?"
"if this is too much for you , then just say so . ''"
"his hands rested lightly on her shoulders and he turned her around to look down into her face ."
"smiling brightly , she wiped all traces of acute disappointment off her face ."
"`` i 'm delighted that you would ask this of me ."
"it is n't often i get asked by someone so high up in the government for something this important . ''"
"kasar watched her face and noticed that she appeared too eager , too brightly excited ."
"`` sarila , was there something else on your mind ? ''"
"`` absolutely not , '' she said and moved away from him ."
"`` do you have a list of the schools you 'd like me to visit ?"
"or teachers ? ''"
"kasar knew that she was n't telling him something but she was hiding it well ."
"he wanted to pull her back into his arms and kiss her until she trusted him but he knew he had to take it slowly , let her learn to trust him so she would come to understand how much he respected her and needed her in his life ."
"he did n't know why she was fighting their betrothal now , but he was determined to figure it out , even if it meant binding her to him through sex ."
"he turned back to his desk and handed her a file containing the background on several teachers , both good and bad that he 'd had one of his aides compile ."
"`` here are some names and background information on some of the teachers but there 's also a more complete list in the back ."
"feel free to make up your own mind on who to visit ."
"i 'm not looking to fire any specific teacher but would like a more general idea on how to improve the schools ."
"i know you only have these three days and your parents will want to spend more time with you , but i was thinking you might want a break and more of a purpose during your visit ."
"your mother could come along as well ."
"i trust her opinion and would value her advice . ''"
"sarila took the folder and smiled so he would n't see that her heart was breaking ."
"`` you know i 'd be thrilled to do this for you ."
"i 'll have something on your desk before i leave , '' she said and turned to leave his office ."
"kasar watched her go but when her hand touched the door , he stopped her ."
"`` sarila wait ! ''"
"he called out ."
"he walked over to stand in front of her , his hand brushing her hair away ."
"`` something has changed ."
"please tell me , '' he said ."
"sarila shook her head ."
"`` nothing has changed , kasar ."
"please do n't think so , '' she said , terrified that he 'd see that she really was scared of losing him , knowing that she would in the end ."
"`` we have these few days ."
"let 's not waste them ."
"come to my room tonight and i 'll show you ... '' she hesitated , about to say `` how much i love you '' but stopped herself just in time ."
"`` i 'll show you how much things have n't changed , '' she said instead , tipping her head to the side saucily ."
"kasar nodded ."
"`` i 'll see you tonight , '' he said , then bent to kiss her gently ."
"chapter 10 `` where are you off to in such a good mood ? ''"
"her mother asked , sitting down across from her at lunch later that afternoon ."
"sarila smiled broadly ."
"`` kasar asked me to give him my opinion on the education system while i 'm here . ''"
"nadia grinned ."
"`` that sounds like a great plan ."
"i know kasar has made a lot of improvements but there 's always better ideas and better ways to do things . ''"
"sarila remembered her conversation with kasar at the beginning of their two weeks together ."
"he 'd mentioned that someone else within the palace had influenced him to refurbish the educational system ."
"at the time , she 'd assumed that it had been his mistress ."
"but as she watched her mother take a sip of coffee , she revised her opinion ."
"`` mother , are you the one who pushed to get all the new schools built and improve the curriculum ? ''"
"nadia laughed ."
"`` of course , '' she replied ."
"`` my daughter had chosen her career as a teacher ."
"i started looking into the education in abasar and found it lacking ."
"kasar was very receptive to the idea and started a committee immediately to improve the system . ''"
"`` you did n't have to push him in any way ? ''"
"`` absolutely not , '' nadia replied , shaking her head for emphasis ."
"`` at the time , he was relieved that someone else agreed with him and was willing to take the reigns and get the task done . ''"
"sarila hesitated , wondering what other tasks her mother has done for the men in her lives ."
"dared she ask the burning question about their marriage and all the fights ?"
"if she 'd learned anything being with kasar , it was that things were n't always what they appeared to be ."
"kasar was nothing like she 'd expected him to be ."
"he was charming and funny and strong and courageous ."
"and still he was domineering and overwhelming and tried to bully her at times ."
"but she was strong enough to face that ."
"taking a deep breath , she decided she needed to understand her parents ' marriage if she was ever going to venture into her own , either with kasar or with someone else ."
"if kasar did n't want her , then she would have to get over him and find someone else to love ."
"`` mother , why do you and father fight so much ? ''"
"she asked ."
"nadia 's surprised eyes snapped over to look at her daughter 's worried expression ."
"`` fight ? ''"
"she laughed ."
"`` your father and i do n't really fight ."
"it is more letting off steam for him than fighting ."
"we love each other , dear . ''"
"sarila rolled her eyes ."
"`` mother , i do n't understand how you can call those raging yelling matches anything but a fight ."
"and they were always over things that seemed so insignificant . ''"
"`` you heard them ? ''"
"`` the whole house heard them ."
"you two are n't very good at keeping things down , '' sarila said , looking down at her plate ."
"she was embarrassed for some reason about bringing up something that seemed so intimate now that she was talking about it ."
"nadia put her hand under her daughter 's chin and smiled gently ."
"`` dear , is that why you do n't want to marry kasar ? ''"
"she said , understanding showing in her eyes ."
"`` are you afraid that he 'll be too domineering and will try to break you to his will ? ''"
"`` something like that , '' sarila confirmed ."
"she knew kasar would n't intentionally hurt her , but he sometimes rode roughshod over other people 's opinions ."
"but now that she thought about it , he never did that to her ."
"he was always extremely considerate of her feelings and opinions ."
"nadia laughed softly ."
"`` that explains so much . ''"
"she shook her head and put her coffee cup down onto the saucer ."
"`` i remember finding you under your bed one morning with your pillow over your head ."
"was that because you heard your father and i fighting ? ''"
"sarila laughed at the memory as well ."
"she 'd been about ten years old and had gone downstairs once she 'd heard her father 's voice ."
"he 'd been away for three weeks that time , traveling and working on government business ."
"she 'd been sent to bed earlier since no one ever knew when her father would finally arrive home ."
"but that night , she remembered hearing his voice and running down the stairs ."
"she 'd stopped in the middle of the foyer while her father ranted and raved at her mother for some reason ."
"sarila had been so distraught when her mother had yelled back that she 'd run into her room , not even hearing the words , only the voices ."
"she nodded at her mother ."
"`` yes ."
"i remember that ."
"i 'd come downstairs , excited to see father but only saw the two of you fighting . ''"
"nadia chuckled again ."
"`` i 'd been speaking to him on the phone for the past half hour that night , '' she explained , her hands wrapping around her cup to warm them and her eyes grew misty as she thought back to that night ."
"`` i knew he was tense and needed an outlet ."
"so i told him that i 'd broken a tea cup earlier that day . ''"
"`` he was angry with you for breaking a cup ? ''"
"she asked , not sure what she was missing or what her mother was really trying to tell her ."
"that made her mother laugh harder ."
"`` no , of course not ."
"like i said , he just needed an outlet . ''"
"she looked at sarila 's confused face and sighed ."
"covering her daughter 's hands with her own , she leaned forward to explain ."
"`` you 're father has a very important job within the government ."
"he steps in to negotiate when no one else has been successful ."
"but he also has a very bad temper which he has to control almost constantly ."
"when i could sense he needed to vent , i would tell him something silly and inconsequential and he would yell for a few minutes , or maybe longer , depending on how hard the day had been for him ."
"then he would calm down , lower his voice and all of his frustration would be out ."
"completely burned up on something silly . ''"
"sarila was starting to understand ."
"`` so you purposely pricked his temper ? ''"
"she 'd never understood her parents '' relationship but had always known that they loved each other ."
"now her respect grew for both her mother , who loved her father enough to anger him when he needed it , and her father , who made sure he never hurt his family with his temper and work frustrations ."
"she was in awe of their marriage now as opposed to not wanting anything like it only two short weeks ago ."
"`` absolutely ."
"then we could get down to the real business of our reunions , '' she said , smiling brightly and waving her hands as if she 'd wiped away all their fights in the past ."
"`` you see , your father is a very strong man and if he does n't have an outlet , he just lets things fester inside him ."
"once they fester , they may come out in dangerous situations or he might not be able to act as diplomatically as he might need to in other situations ."
"i act as his outlet ."
"he 's never laid an angry hand on me or anyone ."
"he has always been satisfied with a good , old fashioned yelling match , then he 's a happy man again , able to live and laugh and love . ''"
"hearing this explanation from her mother put so many things into a much clearer light ."
"all the loud shouting matches over things that just did n't seem to matter ."
"in reality , they did n't matter and that was the whole point !"
"`` how long has this been bothering you ? ''"
"her mother asked , her wise eyes taking in her daughter 's worried expression ."
"`` a long time . ''"
"`` is this why you ran away all those years ago ? ''"
"sarila looked at her hands and nodded ."
"`` half of it ."
"yours was the only marriage i 'd witnessed and at the time , i was afraid all marriages were like this ."
"once i got out on my own , i realized that there were different kinds of marriages ."
"i just needed to find a husband that would n't want to fight all the time . ''"
"nadia smiled ."
"`` but you never found anyone to match up to your kasar , am i right ? ''"
"sarila was able to be honest with her mother now ."
"`` yes ."
"he 's quite a formidable personality , is n't he ? ''"
"`` i like the idea of you working on a project while you are staying here ."
"can you tell me more about it ?"
"or is this a secret mission that is just between the two of you ? ''"
"she asked ."
"sarila laughed ."
"`` it 's no secret ."
"in fact , it 's just continuing with what you started several years ago . ''"
"sarila explained what kasar had asked of her , and the excitement that had crept up when he 'd first mentioned it , came back with a swift force ."
"she was thrilled that he would ask something so important of her ."
"for the next three days , she rushed from school to school , observing the other teachers and taking notes on the things they did well and the ideas she had for improving the curriculum ."
"she spent most of the day in the schools , then was brought back to the palace by a car reserved exclusively for her use ."
"kasar had given her a computer to work on for the three days she was staying in abasar and she worked frantically to give him feedback ."
"when she was n't working or observing , her parents made sure that every waking hour was spent with friends from her past ."
"she loved the fact that they had arranged dinners and breakfasts with her old friends and it was wonderful to catch up with them , meet their children and husbands or talk about their work lives ."
"but what she really wanted to do was to talk with kasar ."
"she saw him at dinner and one morning for breakfast ."
"but he was always careful to not give anyone the impression that they were a couple ."
"and that made sarila sad ."
"she knew it was what they had both wanted originally , but she wished he did n't want it so badly now ."
"it was a complete change of mindset from what she 'd wanted two weeks ago ."
"unfortunately , there was no way for her to tell him that she 'd changed her mind ."
"would she even have the courage to tell him if she had the chance ?"
"sarila was n't sure of the answer ."
"no matter how much fun there was during the day , the nights were still the best ."
"she retired to her bedroom around ten o'clock each night ."
"by eleven o'clock , kasar slipped into her room and into her bed ."
"although she tried to talk to him , to let him know that her feelings had changed , he would n't let her speak ."
"he would slip into her bed and immediately kiss her , distracting her from her mission ."
"and whenever he touched her , she was unable to think about anything other than his hands and his mouth , moving over her body , filling her and thrilling her , satisfying the needs she had n't known about before meeting him ."
"they made love until neither was able to speak ."
"it was usually early in the morning when they fell asleep , both tangled in each other 's arms and legs ."
"and each morning , he slipped away before dawn , leaving her sleeping until she was woken by a servant bringing her coffee a few hours later ."
"the morning she was supposed to leave , she woke just as the door was closing behind kasar ."
"she jumped out of bed , hoping to catch him and talk to him , but by the time she opened the door to call him back , he had already disappeared from the hallway ."
"peering out into the hallway , all she saw were the guards making their rounds ."
"none even glanced her way , thankfully since she was barely covered by a silk robe ."
"she sat back on her bed , the tears rolling down her face as she realized that she might never see kasar again after today ."
"she would go back to california , to her teaching and her lonely life with her friends that would never become boyfriends and kasar would marry some awful woman who could never love him as much as she did ."
"this stranger might be beautiful and dutiful , but no one would understand him and feel as much for him as she did ."
"he deserved someone better than she though ."
"he deserved someone who would dedicate her life to making his reign successful and profitable for all the people ."
"sarila knew she loved him but would n't be satisfied living her life through her husband ."
"not that kasar would ask that of her ."
"but he deserved someone truly dedicated to him ."
"she tried to pull herself together , to show a strong front , but the tears rolled down her face as she packed her bags that morning ."
"sarila heard the door open but just assumed it was the servant bringing her morning coffee ."
"`` i do n't need any coffee , today ."
"thank you though . ''"
"she said , her back to the door ."
"`` i do n't have any coffee , but i do have a good ear to listen , '' her mother said , coming up behind sarila and putting her arms around her shoulders , hugging her gently ."
"sarila could n't hold back the flood of tears any longer ."
"`` oh , mother ."
"what am i going to do ? ''"
"she asked , turning into her mother 's embrace and sobbing out her misery ."
"her mother wrapped sarila up in her gentle arms and rocked her back and forth as if she were a child while sarila cried her eyes out ."
"when the storm had lessened slightly , she sat back and looked at sarila ."
"`` have you considered telling him how you feel ? ''"
"sarila sniffed and wiped her tears away with a tissue , shaking her head ."
"`` i 've tried ."
"but each time i start to talk to him , he just ... . ''"
"she was going to say he kisses her or distracts her with his touch , but she could n't tell her mother that ."
"but nadia was not blind ."
"`` he has a way about him , does n't he ? ''"
"she smiled knowingly ."
"`` your kasar is quite the lover , i 'm guessing . ''"
"`` i do n't ... . ''"
"she started , but she 'd never been able to lie to her mother ."
"`` he 's not 'my ' kasar , mother . ''"
"nadia smiled gently ."
"`` but you 'd like him to be would n't you ? ''"
"she asked softly ."
"`` you 're in love with him , '' she said as if that made everything okay ."
"sarila did n't answer but there really was no need ."
"the truth was written all over her face ."
"`` does daddy know ? ''"
"`` that you 're in love with him ?"
"or that you 've been making love with him every night ? ''"
"`` sarila grimaced ."
"`` either one . ''"
"`` he knows your feelings but probably not your activities ."
"he might even know about that but is n't willing to acknowledge those kinds of things in his mind ."
"he 'll turn a blind eye until he needs to do something about it ."
"that 's what makes him such a wonderful diplomat ."
"he knows when to speak up and when to look away . ''"
"sarila laughed but it was more of a hiccup ."
"`` yes , he 's very good at his job , i guess . ''"
"nadia 's head turned sideways as she searched her daughter 's face , noting the signs of strain ."
"`` why have n't you told kasar how you feel ? ''"
"she sniffed and wiped her eyes with a tissue ."
"`` because he does n't want to be married to me . ''"
"`` how do you know ? ''"
"`` it was basically the first thing he said to me when he found me on the beach back in california , '' she explained , smiling at the memory of his body guard face down on the ground ."
"`` did n't you feel the same way at that point ? ''"
"`` yes , '' `` but you 've changed your mind since then , right ? ''"
"sarila sighed heavily , wondering why her mother kept asking these kinds of questions ."
"`` yes ."
"what 's your point mother ? ''"
"she said , piling a stack of clothes into her duffle bag ."
"`` my point is , '' her mother said , rolling her eyes at her daughter 's obtuseness , `` that you felt the same way about kasar initially but now you 've changed your mind ."
"now i know that it is a bizarre suggestion , but have you ever considered the possibility that he might have changed his mind about you as well ? ''"
"sarila shook her head emphatically ."
"`` no ."
"kasar knows his mind ."
"it 's one of the things i respect about him . ''"
"`` i think you 're wrong about his feelings toward you ."
"i 've seen the way he looks at you and it is n't a man who is ready to let his woman depart , '' nadia said with feeling ."
"`` and if you 're wrong , and he feels the same way about your relationship , then leaving today would be one of the biggest mistakes of your life . ''"
"hope flared in her chest and she considered her mother 's words ."
"could kasar feel the same way ?"
"but if he did , why had n't he said anything ?"
"why had he smothered her words each night when he came to her ?"
"and more importantly , why had n't he said anything to her ?"
"the hope died painfully and sarila looked back down at her hands clutching the tissue mercilessly ."
"`` i think you 're a romantic , '' sarila countered , wishing that her mother 's words were true but unwilling to even consider them for fear that her mother was wrong ."
"nadia took her daughter 's hands in hers , then touched her cheek to get sarila to look at her ."
"`` i 've seen the way he treats you , the way he looks at you from across the room , the way he laughs when you laugh but he ca n't hear anything you 're saying because you 're too far away ."
"i 've seen the way he protects you , even from your parents , '' she laughed , shaking her head at the audacity of the man ."
"`` he 's in love with you , sarila ."
"and if you 're so thickheaded that you ca n't see it , then you do n't deserve him , '' she said , turning away to take the next stack of clothes , tossing them into her suitcase ."
"sarila stared at her mother ."
"`` how does he look at me ? ''"
"she asked , that vicious spark of hope flaming back to tentative life within her heart again ."
"what had her mother seen that sarila had missed ?"
"nadia put a hand on her daughter 's arms ."
"`` he looks like he 's in love with you , '' she said , emphasizing each word ."
"`` do n't let him get away simply because you 're too afraid to let him know you feel the same way ."
"pride is the only thing standing in your way right now and i can guarantee that pride wo n't keep you warm on cold nights and it wo n't put a smile on your face when you 're feeling down ."
"only kasar can do that for you and i think you know that , do n't you ? ''"
"the idea of declaring her love for him was too terrifying when he 'd given her no indication that her feelings were reciprocated ."
"for him , it had been just good sex between the two of them ."
"sarila was just another woman in a long line of them that had found ecstasy in his arms and his bed ."
"`` it 's too late , '' sarila said , dumping the rest of her clothes into the suitcase , not caring if they were neat or not ."
"she did n't care much about anything at this point ."
"`` i 'm leaving in less than an hour . ''"
"her mother made a very unfeminine sound as she took in her daughter 's stubborn chin ."
"`` you do n't have to go , '' her mother said emphatically ."
"`` it is n't like you 're on a commercial flight or anything , '' she said , frustrated now and starting to tear up herself ."
"sarila zipped up her suitcase , took a deep , sustaining breath , then took her mother 's arm and led her down the hallway ."
"`` let 's go have breakfast ."
"i 'm finished here , '' she said ."
"her mother allowed sarila to guide her down the hallway but was reluctant to let her change the subject so easily ."
"`` why do n't you go find kasar and talk to him instead , '' nadia said ."
"`` you 've talked to me enough lately and obviously not enough to that man of yours . ''"
"sarila wished she had the courage , but she was too scared ."
"in the end , she did n't have to go find him ."
"he was sitting at the table already ."
"kasar rose when they stepped into the breakfast room , then came around the table to help sarila into her chair ."
"the king and queen were also there as was sarila 's father ."
"everyone looked very glum ."
"the group spoke only in generalities during breakfast ."
"sarila could n't eat anything so she just sipped her coffee and looked down at the dark brew , wishing she was alone with kasar ."
"her mother 's words kept slipping into her mind and she dared a look up at kasar occasionally ."
"but he looked stern and very unapproachable ."
"kasar watched in frustration as the five other occupants of the table discussed the weather and various functions that had happened over the last three days ."
"he was furious that he had n't been able to convince sarila to stay and felt like slamming his fist down onto the wooden table ."
"instead , he stole glances at the beauty who would never accept a life with him , wishing he could somehow show her that they could make it work , that he could make her happy being married to him ."
"but he knew it was no use ."
"if he had n't convinced her by now , there was nothing left for him to do ."
"she would climb on board the helicopter and fly back to the life she preferred , leaving him to a life of emptiness without her smile and her challenges ."
"why did n't she understand that they were perfect in every way for each other ?"
"he did n't want to tie her down but needed her wisdom and compassion to make abasar a better place for their people ."
"why was she being so stubborn ?"
"he knew that she loved him ."
"was marrying him so abhorrent ?"
"but he 'd tried , both physically by making love to her with everything he had , as well as intellectually by showing her how she could make a difference in their people 's lives through a better education ."
"gripping his coffee , he wished he could just leave her now and not watch her run away again ."
"he wished he 'd never gone off to get her and bring her home ."
"he could have somehow convinced his parents that the betrothal should be set aside ."
"now he had the ache of loving her , knowing she was going to reject him ."
"the whipping of the helicopter blades almost had sarila break down in tears again ."
"she looked out the window and saw one of the servants put her suitcase into the back of the helicopter ."
"`` i guess i 'd better get moving , '' she said and stood up sadly ."
"it felt as if her feet were encased in lead shoes ."
"she just did n't want to leave and wished something would happen , some sign from kasar that would indicate that perhaps her mother had been right earlier ."
"nadia sniffed and took her daughter in her arms , giving her a hug ."
"`` you know this is wrong , dear ."
"you should tell him what you are feeling ."
"be brave and know that you are loved in return !"
"if you do n't find the courage , rest assured , we 'll come out to see you next month , '' she promised ."
"her father hugged her gently , then looked at her with his serious , all knowing eyes ."
"`` you should n't be leaving , '' he said sternly ."
"`` you know what you should do ."
"have courage , '' he said ."
"sarila stared at him as he stepped away and put his arm around nadia ."
"the king and queen gave her a kiss and a gentle hug , then everyone turned to kasar who was standing to the side ."
"he came over to her and hugged her , blocking everyone 's view with his broad shoulders ."
"`` walk me to the door ? ''"
"she asked , working up the nerve to say something to him ."
"a muscle clenched in his jaw and she could see that he was about to turn her down ."
"`` i should say goodbye here , '' he said ."
"his eyes were hooded as he looked down at her ."
"she remembered her mother 's story about providing what her father needed , despite his needing to ask for it ."
"her father 's encouragement also gave her strength so she shook her head , indicating that a simple goodbye was n't going to suffice ."
"`` i need to talk to you , '' she whispered , glancing behind him to see four pairs of eyes that were filled with curiosity and tears ."
"there were also two pairs that were filled with pride ."
"her mother nodded slightly , her fingers crossing superstitiously ."
"kasar nodded but his jaw clenched ."
"sarila almost lost her courage , but another look from her mother gave her the last little boost she needed ."
"she pulled him along , stopping him right outside the door ."
"the noise was loud but she pulled him down so she could talk in his ear ."
"`` i know you 're not interested in marriage right now , but if you ever do , in the future ... '' she stumbled , looking down at her hands that were twisting in front of her , `` well , i love you , '' she shouted , then looked away ."
"`` i know you deserve someone who will be a wonderful mother and i 'd probably want to help with the schools whenever i could but i love you and i know i would make you a wonderful wife but i also know you 're not ready right now , '' she said , and sniffed back the tears that were streaming down her face again ."
"`` but anyway , just think of me once in a while , '' she said , then turned and ran toward the helicopter , needing to escape her humiliation as he just stood there staring at her ."
"she was walking up the steps to the helicopter , almost to her escape when she felt a steel band wrap around her waist and lift her up ."
"she reached down and felt kadar 's hand and forearm , his body was plastered against her back and he was carrying her back inside the palace ."
"once inside and she could take a breath , he turned her around , placing her back up against the wall ."
"`` repeat what you just said , '' he demanded , one arm on either side of her head ."
"sarila looked at the buttons on his shirt and took a deep breath ."
"they were alone now ."
"he 'd taken her into another room off the courtyard ."
"`` i said , i hope you 'll think of me ... '' `` the part before that , '' he commanded ."
"`` the part about you not being ready for marriage ? ''"
"`` no , the thing you said right before that ."
"she took a deep breath and looked outside ."
"`` i love you . ''"
"kasar pulled her against his body and hugged her ."
"`` that 's what i thought you said . ''"
"he looked down at her , then his mouth descended to hers , kissing her wildly , making her head spin with the wonder of his kiss ."
"`` i love you too , '' he said and kissed her again ."
"it was a long time before he let her up for air but by that time , she did n't care anymore ."
"her arms were wrapped around his neck and her body was plastered against his , reveling in the feeling of his warmth and his solid strength ."
"the king cleared his throat behind them ."
"`` i do n't mean to intrude on what i hope is a very joyful and meaningful moment , but may i dismiss the helicopter ?"
"it is really messing up my crepe myrtle , '' he said , chuckling as the couple looked up with glazed eyes ."
"`` please do , '' kasar said ."
"`` and set the date for as soon as possible , '' he said before dipping his head down to kiss her again ."
"the king smiled from ear to ear before leaving ."
"`` three weeks , kasar ! ''"
"he said and pulled the door closed ."
"`` what 's in three weeks ? ''"
"she asked , gasping as his hand slipped underneath her shirt and touched the sensitive skin on her back ."
"`` our wedding , '' he said , kissing her neck ."
"`` do you think your father would mind if i carried you back to your room to make love to you ? ''"
"he asked , pulling her hips closer to his so she could understand what his body was asking for ."
"`` i think he would mind very much , but i know i 'll need a nap pretty soon , '' she said ."
"`` good ."
"i 'll watch over you to make sure you sleep , '' he laughed ."
"`` are we really getting married ? ''"
"she asked , ignoring the fact that she was not going to catch up on her sleep any time soon ."
"`` in three weeks , '' kasar confirmed ."
"`` i love you , '' he said and smiled down at her ."
"`` why did you have to wait until the last minute to tell me you loved me ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"sarila laughed ."
"`` because every time i tried to talk to you last night , you kissed me . ''"
"kasar threw back his head and laughed ."
"`` i was trying to keep you from telling me to leave you alone . ''"
"she laughed delightedly then threw her arms around him , loving him even more ."
"`` i love you ! ''"
"she said ."
"`` and you 'll continue to help improve the education system ?"
"and have children with me ?"
"and become my queen ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` only if you 'll love me and give me lots of babies , '' she confirmed ."
"`` it 's a deal , '' he said , bending down to kiss her again ."
"chapter 1 the lightening flashed outside as an electric storm huddled over danibe , the capitol city of asham ."
"every once in a while , the thunder would boom , sometimes causing the glasses on the table to shake precipitously ."
"the mood inside the elaborately decorated room within the palace of asham matched the ferociousness of the outside storm ."
"kalil asidua benoit the third , sheik of asham sat at the end of the highly polished wooden table and listened as the angry voices argued across the table , some men standing up in their efforts to be heard , angry fists and pointing fingers ."
"`` enough , '' kalil said , his black , intense gaze taking in every man in the room to see if any would challenge him ."
"none dared ."
"the moment he spoke , silence descended on the group and twenty pairs of eyes turned to look at him expectantly ."
"`` i 've heard both sides of this argument and i believe we should move forward with the purchase , '' he said firmly ."
"turning to jasir , his personal secretary who shadowed him almost always , he said , `` make the arrangements to travel to london ."
"we 'll leave tomorrow afternoon . ''"
"without another word , he stood up to leave and twenty men also rose hurriedly to their feet as well , protocol dictating that no one sat when the crown prince was not sitting ."
"without a backwards glance , kalil left the room , his thoughts immediately moving on to the next meeting and the issues it would present ."
"`` what 's next , jasir ? ''"
"kalil asked , walking quickly down the hallway ."
"jasir had to rush to keep up with the prince ."
"jasir was a small man , only five feet six inches which made it difficult to keep up with the man he served who was nine inches taller and was much more muscular which meant kalil 's strong body ate up the distance wherever he went ."
"slightly out of breath already , jasir consulted his schedule ."
"`` you have a one o'clock meeting with the minister of the interior , then a two o'clock meeting with your father ."
"also , your mother has requested your presence at dinner tonight , '' he said but this last was delivered with more hesitancy ."
"`` will my fiancee be there ? ''"
"he asked ."
"jasir nodded but because kalil was already three feet ahead of him , kalil could n't see the affirmation ."
"`` yes , your highness . ''"
"`` and will my brother ? ''"
"kalil asked , stopping with one hand on the door to the conference room ."
"`` i do n't believe he will be , '' jasir said ."
"kalil thought for only a moment ."
"`` be sure jasim is in attendance . ''"
"kalil disappeared into the room , leaving jasir to follow or take care of the order for dinner ."
"five hours later , kalil walked into the family dining room ."
"he immediately noted the tension between the two other occupants and smiled slightly ."
"`` fighting again , jasim ?"
"and with such a lovely lady ? ''"
"he asked , walking over to where jalla was standing by a sofa looking flushed and aggravated ."
"`` i 'd never argue with such loveliness , '' jasim said but there was an edge to his voice as he replied , betraying the truth behind his words ."
"jalla ignored jasim 's dig and turned to smile gently up at kalil ."
"`` how are you tonight ? ''"
"she asked , accepting the kiss kalil bestowed on her hand ."
"`` very well , and you ? ''"
"kalil returned with equal civility ."
"`` fine , thank you , '' she said evenly but kalil did n't miss the glare she shot over to jasim as if to challenge her assertion that she was fine ."
"`` am i missing something ? ''"
"kalil asked in a steady voice and walked over to the bar to pour himself a drink ."
"`` nothing at all , '' jasim said ."
"`` how is that new stallion that arrived yesterday ? ''"
"he asked , changing the subject ."
"kalil and jasim talked about horses until their parents arrived ."
"the dinner was uneventful and afterwards , kalil walked jalla down the hallway to the suite of rooms she used whenever she stayed within the palace ."
"jalla had grown up in the palace and had been named kalil 's betrothed at birth ."
"kalil knew that they would work out well together once they were married ."
"`` why do n't you want to set a date for the wedding ? ''"
"she asked when they 'd reached the doors to her suite ."
"kalil smiled benignly down into her soft brown eyes ."
"`` because i do n't think it is the right time , '' kalil said , standing in front of her and taking her hands in his ."
"`` is there anything you 'd like to tell me ? ''"
"he asked ."
"jalla 's eyes clouded over and she started to speak , only to stop and shake her head ."
"`` no ."
"i was just hoping to start our marriage and give you the children you need for the future . ''"
"kalil smiled gently down at her ."
"`` that is very generous of you but the time will be right for your wedding soon enough ."
"i promise . ''"
"with those words , he lifted her hand and kissed her gently on the fingers ."
"then stepped away to wait until she was safely inside her suite ."
"chapter 2 quickly unlocking the door , dani dropped her small bag of groceries onto the counter and grabbed the ringing phone ."
"groaning loudly in frustration , she forced herself to ignore the broken egg that oozed out of the carton and stepped back so the mess would n't get onto her shoes ."
"it had been a long day and all she wanted to do was curl up in the corner of her sofa and read a good book ."
"some instinct told her not to answer the phone ."
"but the insistent sound forced her to answer it only so it would stop ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"she asked , out of breath from rushing up the narrow staircase and pushing the brown curls off her face and out of the way ."
"`` danielle ?"
"it 's mike down at the restaurant ."
"i hope you do n't have plans tonight because i need you to fill in for chuck . ''"
"dani looked at the clock on the mantle and her groceries on the floor ."
"she wished she could say no but she really needed the extra money for the wedding ."
"biting her lip in indecision , she stared around at her empty apartment ."
"the mystery she 'd been reading the previous night lay open on the chipped coffee table and she knew that the only thing she had in her refrigerator to eat was bread , ketchup and now some broken eggs ."
"`` okay , what time do you need me ? ''"
"she asked , pushing her fatigue and hunger to the back of her mind ."
"she told herself that whatever she could scrounge up to eat at the restaurant would be much better than what she would eat here at home ."
"mike let out a whoosh of relief ."
"`` thanks , dani !"
"i promise you wo n't regret this ."
"i 'll put in an extra few euros for you ."
"can you be here in an hour ? ''"
"he asked ."
"dani nodded , then remembered he could n't see her ."
"`` sure ."
"i 'll be there ."
"what 's the occasion ? ''"
"closing her blue eyes against the sight of the beaten up but comfortable couch , she resigned herself to a night of being on her feet and smiling at people she did n't particularly like ."
"`` i do n't know ."
"i just know that chuck , the guy normally scheduled to work tonight , did n't pass the background check and so i submitted your name and you passed , of course , '' he chuckled ."
"`` background check ? ''"
"dani did n't like the sound of that ."
"it sounded a little invasive ."
"it was just waitressing work ."
"why in the world would a background check be required , she wondered ."
"`` yeah , there 's some big shin dig with a lot of dignitaries here tonight ."
"i do n't know anything else since they would n't tell me more but everyone working tonight had to have a quick background check . ''"
"`` interesting , '' she said , but she did n't really think so ."
"in fact , she was n't even mildly curious ."
"`` i 'll give you the bar so it will be easier tonight , '' he said , letting her know she 'd be bar tending instead of serving food which was more difficult ."
"`` thanks , mike ."
"i 'll be there in an hour , '' she replied unenthusiastically ."
"`` you 're a doll ! ''"
"he exclaimed and rung off ."
"dani picked up the groceries that had fallen from the counter to the floor and sighed heavily ."
"the last thing she wanted to do after a full week of teaching first graders was to mind the bar , pouring drinks for spoiled , wealthy clientele but if it would mean a little extra money , she was all for it ."
"every euro she saved brought her that much closer to her wedding date ."
"she and mark had dated for a year and almost engaged for another six months but he did n't want to commit to a wedding date until they had enough to pay for the wedding themselves ."
"she loved him but did n't understand his desire to pay for an elaborate wedding they could ill afford ."
"she was a school teacher and he an accountant so it was n't as if either of them could afford the extravagance ."
"in her mind , it made more sense to work towards buying a small house ."
"she was fine with this small apartment but it only had one bedroom ."
"dani wanted to have children as soon as possible and it would be difficult if they were still living in a small , one bedroom apartment ."
"mark had his own place which was even smaller than hers so neither was a good option for having children ."
"dani wished mark felt the same way about kids ."
"she did n't understand his need to have things financially secure before venturing out into something ."
"did n't he know that kids needed love and security much more than they needed fancy clothes and designer shoes ?"
"dani quickly put her groceries away and changed for her evening ."
"since her hair was already pulled back from her day of teaching , she just pulled on a pair of black slacks , white , starched shirt and carried the requisite tie in her purse as she rode the subway to the posh restaurant ."
"`` thank goodness you 're here , '' mike said as soon as she walked into his office ."
"`` the guests are already arriving so you 'll have to hurry ."
"i 've checked the bar and put in extra supplies , '' he said , his face red with worry and exertion ."
"then he stopped a moment to look at her ."
"`` you look fantastic , by the way ."
"no one would think you were a school teacher , '' he joked , looking over her black and white uniform that barely hid her voluptuous figure and slim hips ."
"but it was n't really her petite , curvy frame that made men stop and stare ."
"it was her eyes ."
"she had the most incredible blue eyes that captured and held onto an observer ."
"they were surrounded by long , black lashes and high cheekbones with the most incredible translucent skin ."
"mike reminded himself that he was a married man and cleared his throat ."
"`` sorry ."
"i was distracted , '' he said shortly and turned away ."
"`` follow me and i 'll help you set up the bar for the night ."
"`` what 's going on ? ''"
"she asked again as he hurried her into the private dining room ."
"as soon as she walked through the kitchen , the smell of roasting beef and chicken mixed in with garlic and butter struck her with a powerful aroma ."
"her stomach started protesting her lack of dinner and she grabbed a dinner roll to tide her over until she could grab something more substantial ."
"mike picked up a roll himself and took a bite , shaking his head in response to her question ."
"`` i do n't know and i do n't care ."
"if i survive tonight , i 'll count myself lucky , '' he whispered ."
"she was about to ask why he was so nervous but then she saw the tall , serious men standing on the outside of the private dining room , their backs against the mahogany doors ."
"`` who are they ? ''"
"she asked , feeling like she was being watched as she walked through the dining room doors ."
"they looked to mike before they moved out of the way , holding the door for her politely ."
"`` guards , '' he said and left her standing in the middle of the dining room alone as he hurried off to ensure that the kitchen staff was organized ."
"dani did n't understand the worry ."
"the restaurant regularly hosted many dignitaries , even heads of state on occasion ."
"dani had never worked those dinners since they were during the week usually but she 'd heard about them ."
"she only worked on friday and saturday nights , reserving the other evenings for preparing or reviewing her lesson plans ."
"she was able to sleep in on saturday and sunday mornings so she did n't mind the fatigue ."
"it meant she did n't get to see mark as often as she 'd like though ."
"that concerned her a little , she thought as she slipped behind the beautifully carved and polished bar , organizing the bottles for quick service ."
"within five minutes , she had several men lined up demanding drinks ."
"she quickly and efficiently served them their cocktails and so it went for over an hour ."
"dani had no idea what was being discussed since they were speaking in arabic or some other middle eastern language she could n't even guess at ."
"she kept her head bent most of the time searching for bottles anyway ."
"she was n't sure , but she sensed that several of them were talking about her ."
"a small part of her wished they would move on and conduct their conversations somewhere else but the night became too busy to be worried about a couple of rude men who leered at her ."
"she was busily searching for the tonic water when a sudden silence fell over the room ."
"a loud voice seemed to announce something ."
"but since it was still in another language , she just continued to search for the extra bottles of tonic ."
"everyone around bowed just as dani stood up victoriously , a large grin spreading across her rosebud lips ."
"her blue eyes looked around , trying to figure out what was going on and why it became quiet so suddenly when her eyes slashed across the room , right into the eyes of the most gorgeous man she 'd ever seen ."
"dani 's smile of victory quickly dissolved as the man 's eyebrow went up and he looked over at her ."
"she felt as if she were being stripped naked ."
"his eyes took in her starched shirt that was now pulled tightly across her voluptuous breasts and her slacks that fit her slim hips , tapering down to her ankles ."
"she did n't know it , but her eyes were doing the same inventory and he definitely did n't come up lacking ."
"every line of his body and face showed his arrogance , his absolute command and dani was struck with the most bizarre feeling in her stomach ."
"he was extremely tall , well over a head taller than every other man in the room ."
"his shoulders were broad , tapering to hips that did n't hold a bit of flab anywhere ."
"glancing back to his face , she noted the stern mouth , square jaw line and eyes that sharpened with interest as she continued her perusal ."
"when she realized what she was doing , her face flushed and she glanced down at the floor , too embarrassed at being caught in such an awkward position ."
"slowly , the rest of the room stood up and her view of the man was blocked ."
"she felt a small sense of relief as if she 'd been held captive by the intensity of his dark eyes ."
"a shudder went through her and she shook her head at her fanciful notions ."
"looking down , she realized that she was gripping the bottle of tonic water as if her life depended on it ."
"the men who had been waiting on their drinks before the man 's entry turned to face the bar again and continued their conversation as if nothing of great importance had just occurred ."
"a few minutes later , the men all migrated towards the large table with the gorgeous man at the head ."
"the wait staff hurried in , quickly serving the men and thankfully , the wine staff came in directly behind them and served the wine , giving dani a chance to breathe ."
"it was almost two o'clock in the morning when the men finally started leaving ."
"dani was feeling as if she could pass out from fatigue any moment since she 'd been up since five o'clock that morning and had taught a group of thirty children all day ."
"her feet ached and her eyes felt as if there was sandpaper in them ."
"`` you 've done well , '' a deep voice said ."
"dani glanced up and all her fatigue seemed to disappear ."
"here was the man and he was actually speaking to her ."
"it was the first time all evening someone had actually spoken to her that was n't a drink order ."
"`` th ... thank you , '' she said nervously and dropped her eyes to the polished wooden bar ."
"`` can i get you something to drink ? ''"
"she asked politely ."
"`` only if you 'll join me , '' he replied ."
"dani 's eyes shot right back to his ."
"`` oh , well ... no , i 'm sorry but i ca n't , '' she explained ."
"`` of course you can , '' he countered ."
"`` just pour yourself a glass and come around to the other side , '' he said and added a devastating smile to his words ."
"dani 's stomach started that flipping fluttering thing again , making her feel slightly queasy ."
"`` no ... i mean , thank you very much for the offer but it is against the rules , '' she said ."
"`` but i would be more than happy to serve you anything you 'd like . ''"
"after a long moment , the man replied , `` and if it is you i would like ?"
"would you serve me ? ''"
"dani actually took a step backwards and gasped ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"the man smiled ."
"`` i 'm guessing that you are not being offered as dessert , '' he replied ."
"`` i apologize if i 've offended you ."
"but please , come have a glass of wine ."
"you look like you are exhausted ."
"i guarantee you will not be fired . ''"
"dani shook her head ."
"`` no , thank you , '' she replied stiffly ."
"the man did n't take offense at her cool tone but stood up and actually came around to the back of the bar ."
"`` sit , '' he ordered and dani was shocked to find herself obeying his order ."
"she plunked herself down on the bar stool and glared at him ."
"the effort only caused him to chuckle and the sound soothed her ruffled feathers more than his apology ."
"`` again , i apologize for offending you . ''"
"he poured a glass of white wine and placed it in front of her before turning to pour some bourbon into a glass for himself ."
"when he was done , he came around to the other side and sat down in the bar stool next to her ."
"they were the only ones left except for the guards who she noticed were standing sentry right outside the double doors that stood slightly ajar ."
"`` what is your name ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` danielle , '' she said ."
"`` and yours ? ''"
"the man looked surprised but only smiled slightly ."
"`` you may call me kalil , '' he said and his dark eyes looked directly into her blue ones ."
"`` i 'm surprised your husband would allow you to work this late . ''"
"dani laughed ."
"`` after i 'm married , i do n't think i 'd allow my husband to allow me to do anything , '' she said , taking a sip of the excellent white wine , allowing the cold liquid to slide easily down her throat ."
"`` so you are not married ? ''"
"he said , looking surprised by that announcement ."
"`` that seems hard to believe . ''"
"`` well , i 'm almost engaged , '' she said and looked down at her glass , unable to hold his gaze ."
"there was a long pause ."
"`` you 're boyfriend is not worthy of you , '' he replied ."
"dani flushed ."
"`` mark is a very nice man , '' she countered ."
"kalil just laughed softly ."
"`` any woman who describes her almost fiance as 'nice ' is not in love with him . ''"
"dani 's eyes shot up to him ."
"`` what do you know of love ? ''"
"she challenged ."
"`` i 'm sure you imagine your wife sitting at home , counting the minutes until you arrive to enliven her life with your presence but some of us have our own lives and live it just fine , '' kalil smiled at her description ."
"`` as yet , i am not married either ."
"but i hope the woman i choose to marry will indeed love me to the point of counting the minutes until i arrive at her side . ''"
"`` are you going to do the same ? ''"
"`` no . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` because it is different for a man , '' he replied , amused by her challenge ."
"`` it is different for you , perhaps ."
"but the man i marry will be so in love with me that he will be counting the minutes when i 'm away , ' she said ."
"`` and does your mark ? ''"
"he asked , `` count the minutes , that is , until he sees you ? ''"
"dani just glared at him ."
"she could n't lie because she knew that mark was out with his friends tonight playing cards ."
"he was probably still up doing just that and not thinking of her ."
"kalil laughed again ."
"`` you see ?"
"it is different for a man ."
"but perhaps he is not the love of your life ? ''"
"`` how dare you say that ? ''"
"she said , but the heat was gone from her voice ."
"`` i dare , '' he said and his hand moved to touch her forearm ."
"dani 's indrawn breath was audible and her shocked eyes shot back to his , her arm moving quickly away from his touch but her face flamed to color ."
"it was as if an electric current was shooting through her system , melting her insides and burning her skin ."
"the moment was broken by one of the guards leaning into the room and saying something quickly in arabic ."
"kalil responded and sighed ."
"`` i 'm sorry my dear but i must take this phone call ."
"we 'll continue this discussion when i return , '' he said and stood up , walking out of the room with the determined stride of someone who had been in charge for a long time ."
"dani was so shaken by his touch , she was almost shivering ."
"wait for him to come back ?"
"she thought not !"
"dani jumped off of the bar stool and ran out of the room as if she was being chased by demons ."
"she made her way through the kitchens , grabbed her purse from her locker and left by the back way ."
"it was cold now and the sky was starting to drizzle cold and dreary rain ."
"dani pulled her collar up on her jacket and started walking towards the subway station ."
"she hated herself for reacting so violently towards a man she 'd known for only a half hour ."
"how could she have let him get to her so easily ?"
"kalil - whoever he was - somehow knew her buttons but she 'd escaped ."
"she 'd get back home , soak in a warm shower and snuggle under her blankets ."
"first thing in the morning , she 'd called mark and meet him for breakfast ."
"she 'd sit across from him and be reminded of all the wonderful attributes she loved about him and that would reassure herself of her life 's plan ."
"everything would be okay ."
"headlights shined from behind her but she simply pulled her jacket more securely around her , walking closer to the buildings for safety ."
"she hated being out here this late at night but she did n't have a car so there was no alternative ."
"her heartbeat raced when the car stopped beside her but she refused to even acknowledge the car ."
"news stories of women being abducted from the streets by passing cars raced through her mind and she sped up her walking ."
"the subway stop was still a block away and she felt her body break out in a cold sweat as fear took over ."
"`` danielle , '' a deep voice said from behind her ."
"dani visibly jumped at hearing her name ."
"she stopped and looked around , then saw the long , dark , elegant limousine waiting beside the curb ."
"`` danielle , get into the car please , '' a deep voice said from the dark interior of the car ."
"a man stepped out of the front seat passenger side and held open the door for her ."
"dani hesitated , still terrified but for a whole other reason now ."
"`` no , thank you , '' she said and turned away to start walking again ."
"she 'd only made it a few steps when a strong hand clamped around her elbow ."
"`` danielle , you should n't be out here this late at night ."
"it is dangerous , '' kalil said and pulled her gently but firmly towards the waiting car ."
"`` i will drive you home , '' he said and followed her into the car ."
"the door shut as soon as she sat down and dani looked around , never having been inside a limousine before ."
"`` relax , '' kalil said and pressed a button that separated the driver 's area from the passenger seating ."
"`` why did you run away like that ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"dani sat back , knowing she could n't get away from him now that the car was moving ."
"`` i considered the conversation over . ''"
"`` and i said we 'd continue it when i was off the phone , '' kalil countered ."
"there was n't a hint of emotion on his face but he looked over at the tiny woman who had challenged him and his authority ever since he 'd walked into the dining room tonight ."
"it had been a productive evening and he wanted to spend the rest of the night making love to this shy woman sitting so stiffly across from him ."
"but he had to put her at ease before he could do anything , he knew ."
"she did n't even know the liberties he 'd allowed her ."
"no woman , much less a man , had ever had the audacity to challenge him like this slip of a woman had ."
"why had he allowed it ?"
"deep down , he knew exactly why ."
"and he longed to test his theory again ."
"that one single touch , so brief , had flamed him as no other woman had ever done before ."
"he suspected that she did n't even know what a beauty she was ."
"her reddish brown hair was primly pulled behind her head , showing off her delicate features which were dominated by her sexy eyes that promised so much to anyone looking deep enough ."
"and he was definitely going to search ."
"`` how old are you , dani ? ''"
"he asked suddenly ."
"`` twenty five , '' she said , grateful for the easy questions ."
"`` and you ? ''"
"`` and me what ? ''"
"`` how old are you ? ''"
"kalil smiled again ."
"`` do you know how impertinent you 're being ? ''"
"`` no ."
"you asked me a question ."
"i was just asking it right back . ''"
"`` as i said earlier , it is different for a man ."
"for me . ''"
"dani smiled and kalil held his breath as her cheeks dimpled deeply ."
"`` you 're a bit arrogant , are n't you ?"
"you 're going to have to explain why it is impertinent for me to ask a question but not for you to ask it . ''"
"`` i 'm going to have to ? ''"
"he asked , still shocked that she would dare order him ."
"`` you do n't know who i am , do you ? ''"
"dani shook her head and a small lock of hair fell onto her face ."
"`` no , '' she said as she reached behind her to pull the pins from her hair ."
"`` but i 'm guessing you 're awfully wealthy and that 's what makes you think you can order people around . ''"
"kalil did n't tell her who he was ."
"he liked the fact that she was n't intimidated by him ."
"it was a novel feeling ."
"`` believe it or not , i can order people around . ''"
"`` i 'm sure whatever company you work for , or probably own , you can order anyone about ."
"but i do n't work for you ."
"nor will i ever so let 's just drop that subject , shall we ?"
"about your age ? ''"
"kalil did n't explain that with a snap of his fingers , he could have her fired from whatever position she currently held no matter where she worked ."
"being the crown prince to one of the wealthiest countries in the world gave him enormous power , no matter where he was in the world ."
"`` i am thirty six years old , '' he responded , not sure why ."
"`` why are you so tired ? ''"
"he asked , noting the dark circles under her beautiful eyes ."
"`` because i teach school during the day ."
"that means i 've been up since early this morning and it is almost dawn . ''"
"she looked down at her watch and gasped at the time ."
"`` i 've basically been up for twenty four hours now . ''"
"she looked out the window and noticed that they were almost to her flat ."
"`` how did you know where i live ? ''"
"she asked ."
"kalil did n't answer her but leaned forward and took a lock of her hair between his fingers ."
"`` lovely , '' he said , rubbing the silky strands between his fingers ."
"`` why do you wear it up like that ? ''"
"dani could barely think with his fingers so close to her face ."
"`` i ... .i just ... '' she could n't answer ."
"thankfully , the car slid smoothly to a stop and she pulled away from his hand ."
"she scrambled out of the car , frantically searching for her keys ."
"as much as she 'd like to run away , years of manners forced her to turn around and thank him for the ride home ."
"`` i 'd ... oomph ! ''"
"she said , running into his large , powerful chest ."
"`` what are you doing ? ''"
"she asked , taking a step back on the sidewalk ."
"`` i 'll walk you to your door , '' he said ."
"`` there 's no need , '' she said quickly , knowing that her walkup was tiny , the stairs so narrow they irritated her sometimes ."
"`` seriously , i thank you for the ride but there 's no need to walk me inside , '' she said , trying to be firm but hearing the quiver in her voice as he towered over her ."
"`` my pleasure , '' he replied , taking the keys out of her shaking fingers ."
"`` after you , '' he said ."
"dani knew there was no alternative but to walk up to her flat so he could see she was safe and secure ."
"sighing , she turned and led the way ."
"it seemed like an interminably long walk up the steps and she was self-conscious of him behind her ."
"but at her door , she leaned against the wall , allowing him as much space as possible to unlock her door , which was n't much ."
"he calmly unlocked the door , then pushed it open for her ."
"`` have dinner with me tomorrow night , '' he said , looking down at her face ."
"dani immediately shook her head , refusing to look up at him ."
"she stared down at his hand-made shoes instead , not willing to get pulled into the hypnotic gaze he had ."
"`` no , i do n't think that would be a good idea , '' she replied ."
"he put a small hand under her chin and forced her gaze up to his ."
"dani wished she had the power to resist him , but just as it had earlier , his touch melted her insides and she complied with his unspoken order ."
"mesmerized , she watched as his mouth descended to hers ."
"at the first touch , she was lost ."
"her hands , which had been gripping her small purse , were suddenly gripping the lapels of his perfectly tailored suit and her mouth , which she had willed to be still , were molding to his ."
"her body , which had been pressed against the wall , was suddenly pulled close to his body , her soft curves blending perfectly with his hard planes ."
"dani whimpered , unable to control the passion that was spinning out of control as his mouth deepened the kiss ."
"`` open your mouth , danielle , '' he whispered and she immediately complied , dropping her purse without even knowing what she was doing ."
"all she knew was that the world was tilting and her only solid ground was this magnificent man and his mouth , his body touching every inch of hers ."
"she heard the door close but did n't know what had happened ."
"all she knew was that the hot feelings were coursing through her system , making her mindless and needing more ."
"standing on her toes , she reached for him , her eyes closed and her breathing coming in hard gasps ."
"she felt him pull her shirt out of the waist band of her slacks and then the heat of his hands against her skin ."
"but it did n't matter ."
"nothing mattered anymore except feeling more of what he could do to her ."
"`` kalil ... '' she started to say but he stopped her by covering her mouth again with his , his tongue invading her mouth , mating with hers as his body was craving to do with her body ."
"he touched her skin and was amazed at the silken texture , the slim waist that his hands almost spanned ."
"he pulled away , just enough so he could unbutton her shirt but his mouth never left hers , never giving her a chance to think about what was happening ."
"`` where is your bedroom ? ''"
"he asked , peeling her shirt away , his dark eyes taking in the perfect breasts that were large for her petite frame but fit perfectly in his hands ."
"he liked the lace that covered her breasts , delicate and feminine , just like her ."
"`` why ? ''"
"she asked , then inhaled sharply when his mouth covered her already hard nipple with his mouth ."
"the heat made her body ache and she could n't think , only pull him closer , needing him more and more ."
"`` i 'll find it , '' he said but then her hands touched his skin above his collar and he was unable to think any longer himself ."
"her hands fluttered on his neck , her slim fingers tangling in his hair , pulling his head closer to her ."
"kalil 's suit jacket fell to the floor ."
"his tie was ripped off his neck and tossed behind him and his fingers deftly unbuttoned the shirt , baring his chest to her eager fingers ."
"he sucked in his breath when her hands touched him tentatively ."
"her fingers were so delicate and he wanted to feel her touching him ."
"he pushed her hand against his skin , trapping her hands there between their bodies as he bent down again to capture her mouth ."
"there was no time to move to the bedroom , he thought ."
"all his control had slipped away with the small , exploring touches she gave him ."
"kalil tried to think about something else , anything else that would give him back his control ."
"he 'd always been in control so this was a new and , not so good and yet thrilling experience ."
"picking her up , he carried her through the only door in the small apartment and was gratified to find the bed with its frilly pillows ."
"laying her down in the center , he pushed her back into the softness and buried his face in her soft stomach , his hands working the zipper on her slacks ."
"within moments , she was only in her underwear , his hot gaze taking in her slender hips , tiny waist and perfect breasts ."
"`` you 're beautiful , '' he said with a husky voice and bent down to kiss her thigh , his tongue licking , his teeth nibbling while his hands discarded his clothing quickly ."
"the need to be inside her was driving away every thought in his mind , all control and he gave in to the incredible feelings ."
"dani could barely breathe as he slid her panties down her legs , his mouth kissing every inch along the way ."
"he even pulled her big toe into his mouth , sucking hard and her body writhed on the bed , her fingers itching to hold him again ."
"`` please ! ''"
"she demanded , her thighs aching for something she did n't understand ."
"kalil tried to smile , but it was too much of an effort ."
"sliding up her body , he captured her nipple again , his hands releasing the front clasp and his mouth parted the tiny scrap of material ."
"seeing her breasts , freed from restraint made him lose the small bit of control he had left ."
"his mouth latched onto her nipple again while his legs moved between hers ."
"his body was aching now and he parted her legs ."
"as soon as he started to enter her , he was in ecstasy , feeling her heat close around him and her tight sheath envelope him ."
"`` you 're so tight , '' he said as he pushed into her and then drove in , her wetness driving him wild ."
"`` i 'm sorry , dani , '' he cried out ."
"`` i ca n't slow down , '' he said and buried himself to the hilt ."
"he heard her gasp and felt the resistance but nothing mattered now except helping her find the release so he could too ."
"a small part of his mind acknowledged that she had been a virgin but he could n't stop , even to apologize ."
"his hand reached down between their bodies and helped her ."
"feeling her near her climax drove him over the edge and he could n't give her the additional pleasure he usually strived for with a woman ."
"he could only mindlessly drive into her , the cries of release the only sound besides the blood pounding in his head as he fell on top of her sweet body ."
"rolling over , he pulled her with him , not wanting to crush her as he caught his breath ."
"dani had never imagined that she could feel those things ."
"her mind was reeling and her body was still simmering ."
"she felt whole , complete as he pulled her close , his mouth kissing her shoulder as his hands continued to touch her , feeling her back , resting on her bottom then sliding up her waist to rest just under her breasts ."
"and it was starting again ."
"as he continued to touch her , she could feel him growing inside her , filling her again and his thumb , which had been resting casually , flicked her nipple and she threw her head back , her eyes looking into his as he groaned ."
"`` again ! ''"
"he demanded and pulled her knees forward and her shoulders up ."
"dani was shocked to find her self sitting on him , riding him but his hands were insistent as he lifted her hips , showing her how to move and the friction was incredible ."
"the feelings overwhelmed her and she cried out as his hands fastened on her breasts , his rough thumbs flicking the hard nubbins ."
"`` too much , '' she groaned and tried to push his hands away but he just captured them in one hand , holding them behind her as his other continued to tease her flesh , moving slowly downward but finding spots that triggered more feelings on the journey ."
"this climax was more intense than the first and dani cried out , arching her back as he moved inside her ."
"when she was completely spent , she fell forward , her whole body replete as she laid against his incredible strength , praying that her breathing would once again return to normal ."
"dani fell asleep curled in his arms ."
"two more times that night , she was awoken by his hands touching her skin and making her body come alive ."
"but in the morning , she woke to the bright sunlight , the bed sheets a mess around her ."
"she listened , wondering if he was somewhere in the apartment but the silence that greeted her told her that he had n't stuck around ."
"chapter 3 the morning light brought reality and shame ."
"`` what have i done ? ''"
"she said out loud to the room ."
"but there were no answers other than the unfamiliar soreness between her legs ."
"somehow , dani got through the day ."
"she ignored the ringing phone , too afraid that it might be mark calling to ask her for lunch ."
"she worked that night but did n't see anything of kalil or the guards that had been there the previous night ."
"if it were n't for the small amount of blood on her thighs and her sheets , she might have convinced herself that friday night had n't happened ."
"sunday afternoon , she met mark for brunch ."
"she accepted his brief kiss as she met him in front of the small , quaint restaurant they both normally enjoyed and smiled wanly at him ."
"as he led her to their table , he put a hand on the small of her back ."
"why did n't mark 's touch ignite the same feelings in her as kalil 's did ?"
"as he pushed her chair in for her , he brushed a small , gentle kiss on her cheek but she felt nothing and realized she never had ."
"`` what have you been up to this weekend ? ''"
"he asked her , smiling politely to the waitress who took their order ."
"dani smiled , wishing she could tell him the truth ."
"`` i worked a lot , '' she said ."
"`` great ."
"we 're getting closer , are n't we ? ''"
"he said and took her hand that was resting on the table ."
"`` soon , we 'll have the money for the wedding and we can officially make the announcement . ''"
"dani pulled her hand out from his ."
"`` are we closer ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"he asked , his soft green eyes looking at her with a smile ."
"`` i mean , what are you doing to earn money for our wedding ? ''"
"she asked , trying to take the belligerence out of her tone ."
"`` i mean , you say 'we 're ' getting closer , but you 're not really doing anything extra , are you ? ''"
"mark looked at her and she wanted to wipe the smug smile off her face ."
"`` danielle , you know how demanding my job is ."
"i ca n't work two jobs like you ."
"we 've talked about this before ."
"i thought it was all settled . ''"
"dani took a long breath before answering ."
"`` no , i do n't think we 've discussed it ."
"you 've said you have a lot of work to do but what i 'm now hearing is that you do n't really want to get married . ''"
"`` not true , '' he said , shaking his head and looking across the table at her ."
"`` dani , please do n't become over emotional about this ."
"you teach ."
"i have a lot more responsibility ."
"it is n't easy doing accounting work . ''"
"`` and teaching a class of seven year olds is ? ''"
"she asked , really hearing his words for the first time ."
"`` i 'm not sure i understand your point of view . ''"
"`` now , dani , do n't get so worked up ."
"you do n't know what my job is like . ''"
"`` i know i was working until after two o'clock in the morning on friday night while you were with your friends playing poker ."
"why am i doing this again ? ''"
"`` all our money is going into our future , '' he said evenly ."
"`` no , '' she countered , `` all my money is going into a wedding i do n't really want . ''"
"he smiled and shook his head ."
"`` every woman wants a big wedding ."
"you know how many guests will be there . ''"
"`` i know how many relatives , friends and co-workers you say you need to invite ."
"i 've always wanted a small , church wedding ."
"you 're the one who wants to invite over five hundred of your closest friends and their families . ''"
"`` we ca n't invite just my friends and not their families , dani ."
"do n't be silly . ''"
"he looked at her curiously ."
"`` what 's gotten into you ?"
"you 've never been this ... . ''"
"`` confused ? ''"
"she supplied ."
"`` belligerent , '' he countered ."
"`` and i do n't like it ."
"why do n't you eat your brunch and let 's talk about something else . ''"
"the waitress arrived and he smiled his most charming smile up at her ."
"dani watched , repulsed by the way the waitress smiled right back , as if there was some sort of communication in that smile ."
"leaning forward , she ignored the eggs benedict mark had ordered for her before she could state her preference ."
"dani pushed her eggs around on her plate and simmered ."
"looking up , she shook her head ."
"`` mark would you please kiss me ? ''"
"mark could only laugh ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"`` kiss me , '' she said again and leaned forward over the table ."
"`` sit down , dani , '' he said , looking around to see if anyone else had noticed her actions ."
"`` what 's gotten into you ? ''"
"dani did n't want to say that a tall , gorgeous man with mysterious eyes and bulging muscles had gotten into her ."
"she thought that would be too crass ."
"but she needed to get away from mark ."
"she did n't understand her feelings but nothing had been normal since she 'd picked up the phone on friday night ."
"`` i have to go , '' she said and picked up her purse ."
"mark placed a hand on her hand and pressed down ."
"`` sit down , dani ."
"do not embarrass me ."
"eat your brunch and let 's talk about something more palatable . ''"
"dani looked at the hand covering hers and remembered kalil 's slight touch and the fire it had ignited within her ."
"mark 's touch only made her skin crawl ."
"snatching her hand away , she stood up and slung her purse over her shoulder ."
"`` i 'm really tired of men telling me what to do ."
"if you 'll excuse me , '' she said and walked out of the restaurant ."
"out on the street , she let the tears fall ."
"what had she done ?"
"did n't she love him ?"
"why was she doing this to him ?"
"`` dani ! ''"
"mark called after her but she just started walking ."
"`` dani , wait , '' she heard him say and finally stopped ."
"he caught up to her and stood in front of her ."
"`` if you want me to kiss you , then fine , '' he said and bent down to kiss her cheek ."
"`` there , is that okay ? ''"
"dani wiped the tears from her eyes and shook her head ."
"`` no , i need you to really kiss me . ''"
"mark bent down and kissed her lips , his moving only slightly over hers ."
"he lifted his head and smiled down at her ."
"`` is that better ? ''"
"the tears started faster and dani had to shake her head ."
"`` i 'm sorry mark , '' she wiped the tears from her face before continuing ."
"it was worse , so much worse , she thought ."
"she 'd felt nothing !"
"not even a spark ."
"just the simple touch of his lips and no melting , no nothing ."
"she could n't go through with a marriage to him now ."
"`` i 'm so sorry , '' she said and rushed away from him , ignoring his calls as she raced down the street ."
"she rushed all the way back to her flat , gratefully closing the door behind her and locking it , as if she could lock out everything she 'd done over the past forty eight hours ."
"lying face down on her bed , she almost did n't hear the knock over her sobbing but the determined knock finally broke through ."
"she lifted herself off the bed and wiped her face with a tissue ."
"she debated opening the door , assuming it was mark ."
"but she thought he deserved more than a `` sorry '' on the street as an explanation for ending their one year relationship ."
"a messenger was standing at her door , a large envelope in his hands and a small box ."
"`` ms. danielle munroe ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` yes , '' she sniffed ."
"`` if you 'll sign here , '' he said , handing her a clipboard and pen ."
"dani took the board and signed her name , then handed it back to him ."
"`` what 's this ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` a delivery , '' he replied and handed her the two items ."
"`` have a good day , '' he said and tipped his hat before turning to leave ."
"dani closed the door and examined the package ."
"it was a simple plain envelope and shaking the box did n't reveal anything to her ."
"shrugging her shoulders , she opened the box first ."
"the plain brown wrapping paper revealed a long , slim jeweler 's box ."
"with shaking fingers , dani opened the box and gasped ."
"nestled in the black velvet interior was the most beautiful diamond bracelet she 'd ever seen in her life ."
"she could n't even imagine the total carrot weight of it but was stunned at the size of the diamonds ."
"setting the bracelet down , not liking the assumptions she was making , she picked up the envelope ."
"with shaking fingers , she pulled out the papers ."
"there was no mark on them but they were a legal document giving her several thousand euros ."
"apparently , all she had to do was sign the document and send them back for a check to be endorsed and sent to her ."
"the only words she really understood were at the bottom where the name kalil jamal del basir were written ."
"a payoff !"
"how dare he !"
"dani let the papers fall to the floor as if they were poisoned ."
"the bracelet was more of the payoff , she thought ."
"how dare he !"
"payment for services rendered !"
"dani was horrified that he thought of her in that light , but what was he supposed to think ?"
"she 'd slept with a man only hours after having met him ."
"she picked up the papers and carried them over to the counter , grabbing a pair of scissors ."
"within moments , the papers were tiny bits of confetti , no longer even recognizable as a contract ."
"she sifted them all into the beautiful wooden box that still held the diamond bracelet , then snapped it all shut and stuffed the box into the large envelope ."
"rushing out of her flat , she reached the street just as the messenger was turning off a cell phone and about to reenter his car ."
"`` excuse me , '' she called out before he could close his door ."
"`` could you deliver this back to him ? ''"
"she said and shoved the envelope back into his hands , turning away before he could even utter a protest ."
"dani fled back to her flat , bolting the door behind her and stared at the door , holding her breath in anticipation of the messenger trying to knock on the door ."
"when there was only silence , she fell onto the sofa and the shivers set in ."
"she was doubly horrified by her actions now and wishing she 'd never answered her phone ."
"if she 'd only spent a few more minutes in the grocery store instead of hurrying home friday night , she 'd never be in this position ."
"she 'd still be planning her wedding , still almost be engaged to mark and she 'd still have her innocence and not know what she was missing in life ."
"chapter 4 somehow , dani got through the next few weeks ."
"she taught her classes and slowly started living again ."
"the kids brought her dandelions and apples , colorful pictures of their house , family or pets ."
"she reminded herself that this is what was really important ."
"several times the first week , she had messages from mark ."
"but she did n't want to have anything to do with him , or any man for that matter ."
"she was done with men !"
"they were either selfish , self-centered men who did n't really want her , or they were arrogant swines who thought they could buy everything on the planet ."
"neither appealed to her ."
"so she dove into her work , resigning from the restaurant now that she did n't have to save for a wedding she did n't want and cleaned her apartment every day until it shined ."
"it took a great deal of perseverance but she finally made it through the week ."
"and each time she started thinking about kalil and the way he made her feel , she pushed those thoughts out of her mind ."
"it was pointless and humiliating ."
"she would not be any man 's ... .she could n't even finish the thought , too embarrassed that he thought he could pay her off with a silly trinket and money ."
"`` dani , i need your help ! ''"
"carrie said , coming into dani 's classroom at the end of the day on friday ."
"`` whew ! ''"
"dani said , closing her locker and leaning against it ."
"`` i 'm so glad this year is over , are n't you ? ''"
"carrie smiled ."
"`` yes , but i 'm going to miss those little guys , '' she said , a nostalgic smile on her face for a moment ."
"dani nodded as well ."
"`` i 'm with you there . ''"
"the summer had started and the class had cleared out quickly as all the kids were eager to get to the pool or their homes , to languish for the next nine weeks in relative freedom from homework and grades ."
"`` well , we 'll see most of them next year , '' dani said , snapping out of her melancholy ."
"`` right ."
"well , anyway , that 's not what i wanted to talk to you about , '' carrie said , her excitement of moments before returning ."
"`` i need your help with something , '' she said , clasping her hands together ."
"`` sure , what is it ? ''"
"dani said , picking up her bag containing all her personal items ."
"`` i need you to come with me to the doctor 's office tomorrow , '' she said ."
"dani turned startled eyes to her friend ."
"`` carrie ?"
"do you think ... ."
"? ''"
"carrie nodded ."
"`` i think , but i 'm too afraid to hope ."
"and i do n't want tim to know ."
"we 've had so many false hopes over the past year , i just ca n't let him think it might be happening again this month ."
"would you go with me for the pregnancy test ? ''"
"`` absolutely , '' dani said , more than willing to help her friend out ."
"`` how late are you ? ''"
"carrie blushed , `` i 'm only three days late but ... .well , i just have this feeling that this is the time , '' she explained ."
"dani forced a smile on her face ."
"`` you know i 'll be there ."
"what time ? ''"
"`` i have an appointment tomorrow morning at nine ."
"can i pick you up ? ''"
"`` absolutely ."
"what are you going to tell tim ? ''"
"`` i 'll just tell him i 'm meeting you for breakfast ."
"if the test is positive , i 'll rush home to him ."
"if it is negative , we 'll go out and eat a plate of pancakes and you can make me feel better , okay ? ''"
"`` deal ! ''"
"dani agreed quickly ."
"`` i 'll see you early tomorrow morning , '' she said ."
"carrie hugged her briefly , then rushed out the door ."
"`` thank you , '' she called out behind her ."
"dani had a pang of jealousy but brushed it aside ."
"she genuinely hoped that her friend would have a positive test but it had been over a year since they had started trying ."
"if this month did n't come up positive , they were going to start with the expensive fertility treatments ."
"carrie and tim did n't have the money to burn much less get pregnant but she knew they 'd do just about anything to have a baby , even if it meant adopting ."
"saturday morning dawned bright and sunny with temperatures reaching record highs ."
"dani smiled encouragingly when carrie arrived in their small car and waited in the waiting room with her , holding her hand as they ran the test ."
"it took just a few minutes and both women could tell by the look on the nurse 's face that the news was good ."
"`` you 're pregnant ! ''"
"with those words , the floodgates opened up ."
"carrie started sobbing , deliriously happy and hugging dani , the nurse and even one of the other patients who was in the waiting room with them ."
"the two women rushed out of the doctor 's office and hugged again on the street ."
"`` oh , i ca n't wait to tell tim !"
"come on , i 'll drop you off then rush home . ''"
"`` do n't worry about me , '' dani said , hugging her and wiping the tears off her face ."
"`` i 'll get home through the tube , '' she said and pushed her towards her car ."
"`` oh , dani are you sure ? ''"
"`` absolutely ."
"you should be sharing this news with tim and not me ."
"now go ! ''"
"she said ."
"carrie hugged dani one more time but did n't argue anymore ."
"she just turned on her heel and rushed off to her car , eager to tell her husband the wonderful news ."
"dani watched , feeling completely bereft now that her friend was gone ."
"she saw the bench and walked over to it , letting the tears flow completely unhindered ."
"she was happy for her friend but also sad that her dreams of marrying mark , having her own baby and living in a small cottage , just her own family together were gone ."
"being mark 's wife was no longer her fantasy and when the tall , dark and devastating kalil popped into her head , she stopped it ."
"those dreams were just a nightmare , she reminded herself ."
"her shoulders sagged and she allowed herself to expunge her self-pity for one more moment ."
"then , taking a deep breath , she squared her shoulders and stood up , walking to the subway station that was only three blocks away ."
"she had things to do , one of which was to buy a baby shower present for carrie and tim ."
"she knew they would be inundated with gifts , but she wanted to be the first ."
"she shopped all day , feeling the small articles of clothing , reading baby books and even walking through the furniture stores , wondering what sorts of crib and changing tables carrie would choose ."
"chapter 5 dani turned off the sewing machine , clipping the last thread of the blanket she 'd made for carrie ."
"after shopping all day yesterday , she 'd finally come to the idea of making a blanket of various soft materials for the new baby ."
"it would be full of textures and colors , sparking the baby 's mind and imagination ."
"the doorbell startled her and she rose from her desk , turned sewing table , holding the baby blanket in her hands as she considered the next piece of fabric she would sew to it ."
"`` yes ? ''"
"she said , opening the door with a smile on her face ."
"the smile slowly disappeared as she stared at the man at her door ."
"she pulled the baby blanket closer as if it could somehow ward off whatever insult was being delivered this time ."
"the uniformed man standing on her stoop bowed slightly , handing her a note ."
"dani hesitated before accepting the note , remembering seven days ago when a similarly dressed man bowed immediately towards her ."
"this one was bigger , bulkier and did n't look as nice as the one before ."
"`` good evening , ma'am , '' he said with a slight accent ."
"he said nothing more , just extended his hand slightly to encourage her to accept the note ."
"with shaking fingers , dani took the note and opened the envelope ."
"the words were brief , written in a bold scrawl ."
"it ordered her to follow the messenger so kalil could discuss an issue with her ."
"no signature , just a large `` k '' at the bottom ."
"kalil ."
"how dare he !"
"but of course , he dares ."
"any man who would sleep with a woman , then callously send money and trinkets to ease his conscience would dare anything ."
"`` tell him no !"
", '' she said and was about to close the door ."
"`` on second thought , i 'll meet with him , '' she said and grabbed her purse ."
"`` he deserves to receive a piece of my mind !"
"where do i find him ? ''"
"she asked , trying to maintain a polite tone of voice since this was simply the messenger , but she was hard pressed to do so considering that this person was working for the vile man ."
"`` i am instructed to take you to him , '' he said ."
"`` no , just give me his address and i 'll find it on my own steam , '' she relied ."
"`` address ? ''"
"the man asked carefully ."
"he smiled slightly , softening his harsh features ."
"`` i do n't think you understand , ma'am ."
"i 'm to take you to him , '' he explained carefully ."
"`` and i do n't think you understand , '' she said ."
"`` i 'm not ready to go ."
"that arrogant man can simply wait for me , '' she said and wondered about the horrified look on his face at her words ."
"`` i will wait for you , '' he said after a pregnant pause ."
"she looked at the man and shook her head ."
"`` perhaps if you gave me a phone number , i could call him and explain the situation . ''"
"`` call him ? ''"
"`` yes , on the mobile perhaps ? ''"
"she suggested diplomatically but she really wanted to scream her head off in frustration ."
"his mouth actually dropped open ."
"`` i will wait as long as you require , '' he said and leaned against the wall outside her flat ."
"`` you 're going to wait here ? ''"
"she asked , shocked ."
"`` yes ma'am . ''"
"`` it may be a while , '' she replied ."
"`` i have my orders . ''"
"`` what is your name ? ''"
"the man hesitated again ."
"`` i am called adir , '' he replied ."
"`` well , adir , please return to your place of work and i 'll be ready in a few hours , '' she said and without another word , she closed the door and shook her head in exasperation ."
"she refused to have her weekend dictated to by someone else 's schedule ."
"she stomped over to the sewing machine and sat back down ."
"it took her a while , but eventually , she became more absorbed in her task again and was able to push the arrogant kalil out of her mind again ."
"three hours later , she pulled the soft blanket out of the machine and surveyed the completed project with satisfaction ."
"it looked wonderful , she thought ."
"there were furry , silky and bumpy textures and it had a double layer so it could be used either as a play blanket or to keep the baby warm ."
"stretching her neck , she released the tension that entered her body from bending over her sewing machine for so many hours ."
"dani did n't discount the tension from the messenger , sure that the visit was contributing to the stress ."
"she was going to see kalil again ."
"was that wise ?"
"initially , she had wanted to vent her anger and humiliation at him , but should she see him again ?"
"perhaps it would be better to just close off that day in her life , chalk it up to an extremely bad choice and move on ."
"when the man came back again , she could simply hand him a note , just as kalil had done ."
"it would allow a certain amount of turnabout , she thought ."
"moving into her bedroom , she showered and changed into a soft , well worn pair of jeans and a tee-shirt ."
"she needed to do her grocery shopping for the week and perhaps she would make a special lunch for carrie to celebrate her good news ."
"she wanted to hear how tim took the news ."
"picking up her purse , she pulled it over her shoulder and grabbed her keys , grabbing the blanket as well in the hopes of maybe getting some buttons to add to the blanket at the sewing store ."
"it was only a few blocks from the grocery store and it might still be open at this time of the evening ."
"but as soon as she opened the door , she found herself face to face with adir ."
"`` oh !"
"goodness , have you been here all afternoon ? ''"
"she asked , looking down at her watch ."
"`` it 's been five hours ! ''"
"`` i 'm here to escort you , ma'am ."
"my orders were to wait until you were ready , '' he said ."
"adir pulled a cell phone out of his pocket and started walking down the stairs ."
"he said something in a foreign language that she assumed was arabic and then led the way down the steps ."
"`` but ... adir , i 've decided that i 'm not going to see him ."
"there 's no need , '' she explained ."
"they reached the street and she turned to face him ."
"`` here , '' she said and handed him the letter she 'd printed out ."
"`` this is all that needs to be said . ''"
"she started walking down the street only to be stopped by adir presenting his large form in front of her ."
"`` please , my orders are to bring you . ''"
"he placed a hand on the small of her back and guided her towards a waiting car ."
"with a simple movement , he placed her in the back seat and then proceeded to the front ."
"within moments , they were driving away towards some destination she was unaware of ."
"`` where are we going ? ''"
"she asked ."
"no one answered and she sat back in the luxurious seat , fuming ."
"twenty minutes later , she recognized the signs to heathrow airport and shook her head ."
"the man was meeting her on his way to a business meeting ?"
"how horrible !"
"but the car did n't stop at any of the main gates ."
"it drove down a side street and then right onto the tarmac ."
"a jumbo jet was waiting with stairs leading to it from the pavement ."
"adir got out of the car and opened the door for her , indicating that she should precede him to the plane ."
"`` i 'm meeting him in there ? ''"
"she asked , intimidated despite her determination not to be ."
"`` he is waiting for you , '' he said , waving in the general direction of the plane ."
"dani climbed the stairs , aware of adir directly behind her , acting protectively for some reason she could n't understand ."
"there were many people on the plane , all busily engaged in some activity or another ."
"some were working on computers , others were taking in various languages on the phones ."
"as soon as she boarded , the area quieted ."
"phones were put down , hands hovered over keyboards and several pairs of eyes watched her progress through the room ."
"dani was led to the back of the plane and up a wide staircase to what looked more like a luxurious living room than any plane she 'd been on ."
"it was more luxurious than anything she could have even imagined ."
"she looked around and her eyes finally settled on the point of her anger and humiliation ."
"`` you ! ''"
"he acknowledged her with a slight bow of his head ."
"`` good afternoon , danielle ."
"you 've kept me waiting for a long time . ''"
"`` i did n't know you were on a schedule . ''"
"she could see the smile that he tried to smother and it only made her angrier ."
"`` and if you did know it , would that have influenced you to arrive earlier ? ''"
"`` no , '' she said , squaring her shoulders and wishing she was n't so intimidated by this man ."
"and she also wished her stomach did n't have butterflies flitting through it just at the first sight of the man ."
"his shoulders seemed broader in the white collared shirt versus the suit she 'd seen him in , and out of , the last time ."
"her face turned red at the memory of just how `` out '' of his suit he 'd been ."
"`` i can see that you have a great deal of respect for me and my title . ''"
"dani braved her way through the interview ."
"`` i 'm not sure about your title but i can assure you that i do n't have a lot of respect for you , '' she said , warming to her topic ."
"`` in fact , the only reason i 'm here right now is to tell you how angry i am at you trying to pay me off , as if i were some sort of ... '' she could n't even say the words ."
"`` well , you know . ''"
"he shot out of his chair and walked over to her , towering over her smaller frame ."
"`` do n't ever say something like that again , '' he replied angrily ."
"`` it was never a payment for services rendered . ''"
"`` then what was it ? ''"
"she challenged ?"
"`` if it smells like a rose ... '' she started , leaving the ending to shakespeare 's famous words hanging ."
"she saw the muscle flex in his jaw but refused to back down ."
"`` what you did was horrible ."
"and i 'll never forgive you , '' she said ."
"`` i lost ... . ''"
"she hesitated again , still ashamed of what she 'd done with him but determined to let him know how she felt ."
"`` well , i lost something ... important to me that night ."
"something i 'll never get back but one thing i 'll never give away is my self-respect . ''"
"she turned on her heel and started walking away ."
"but his next words stopped her ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he said and she could hear the sincerity in his voice ."
"she felt his heat through her clothes as he came closer and her whole body tensed in anticipation of his touch ."
"swinging around , she thought to stop him but he was already too close ."
"her hands reached out to steady herself and ended up on his chest , her fingers feeling the strong muscles flexing under her fingers and her breath caught in her throat ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he said again and his voice was husky , his hands gently touching her waist as he looked down into her face ."
"`` i can honestly say that i 've never lost control with any woman before until i met you . ''"
"she could n't hold his gaze ."
"`` is that supposed to make me feel better ? ''"
"she asked , hating the way her voice was breathless and the way her mind was wishing he 'd just kiss her and make her forget everything , just as he had a week ago ."
"`` yes . ''"
"his hand caressed her cheek , gently touching her collar bone ."
"`` you 're more beautiful than i remembered , '' he said ."
"dani swayed closer to him ."
"`` do n't say things like that , '' she said and looked at the buttons in his shirt ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` because ... '' dani hated the fact that she could n't seem to hold a thought around him ."
"what was wrong with her ?"
"she was here to tell him off , then leave ."
"why was she just standing here in his arms , letting him caress her , wishing he 'd do so much more ?"
"it was n't fair ."
"`` anyway , i have to go , '' she said and tried to step backwards out of his arms ."
"`` go ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"thank you for letting me talk to you one last time ."
"please do n't send any more messengers to my flat , '' she said and took a deep breath before priming to step out of his arms ."
"`` i 'm afraid you do n't understand , '' he said , his voice hard and unyielding ."
"`` you need to come with me now ."
"in fact , the engines have started and i believe we are now taxing down the runway ."
"it would be best if you sat down and got your seatbelt on , '' he explained and guided her towards one of the comfortable looking leather chairs ."
"it took a long moment before his words sunk in but her horror was close behind her comprehension ."
"`` what do you mean ?"
"the plane ca n't be taking off ."
"i 'm still on board , '' she said and started to move towards the doors that she 'd entered several minutes ago ."
"kalil took her hand and shook his head ."
"`` in your condition , i think it would be best if you relaxed and took a seat , '' he said ."
"`` in my condition ? ''"
"dani replied , not sure she understood that one but was too focused on the fact that the engines were indeed revving up ."
"`` i have to get off this plane . ''"
"`` that is not possible , '' he countered ."
"she turned to look at him , her blue eyes wide with fear and frustration ."
"`` well , make it possible , '' she yelled back at him ."
"he simply bent down and kissed her , tenderly at first , but when her lips trembled under his , he employed more pressure ."
"dani did n't know what was happening to her , all she knew was that kalil was kissing her ."
"and it was just like the last time ."
"at his first touch , every thought flew out of her mind and she was transported to a world where everything centered around kalil and the feelings he could stir within her ."
"the next thing she knew , she was buckled into the seat and kalil was sitting next to her , casually talking on the phone as if he kissed like that every day ."
"she looked out the window and her jaw dropped open to find that they were already airborne ."
"`` what have you done ? ''"
"he ignored her for a moment and concluded his brief conversation ."
"when he was done , he calmly turned to her , looking at her through hooded eyes ."
"`` i did what was expedient . ''"
"`` expedient ? ''"
"`` exactly ."
"there was no way i was going to let you leave this plane so i just took measures to ensure your safety . ''"
"her angry eyes could barely look at him ."
"`` has the word kidnapping come to mind ? ''"
"kalil surveyed her angry face for a long time before he answered ."
"`` you do n't really know who i am , do you ? ''"
"dani 's hands were fisted in her lap she was so furious ."
"`` i do n't care if you 're a bloody prince , you ca n't do this to me ! ''"
"she saw the smile tilt his lips and her mouth went dry ."
"`` oh , no ! ''"
"`` oh , yes , '' he countered ."
"`` you 're a prince ? ''"
"`` exactly ."
"prince kalil estabi del misiri , at your service . ''"
"`` prince masiri ? ''"
"she said in a small voice , praying he would tell her he was teasing her ."
"`` i guess that name is familiar to you . ''"
"`` but that would mean you 're the crown prince of basir , '' she said , her throat constricting slightly over the words ."
"basir was one of the richest countries in the world because of its oil and industries ."
"and if this man was the crown prince , that meant he was basically ruling the country now since his father was ill and unable to rule ."
"that also meant he was so completely out of her league her mind started spinning at the possibility ."
"before , when she 'd only thought of him as some sort of business tycoon or financier , he 'd been out of her sphere ."
"but the crown prince ?"
"royalty ?"
"good grief !"
"`` you know your world events , '' he said ."
"`` you ca n't be . ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` because last week ... we ... i did n't ... .not with a prince , '' she said haltingly ."
"his smile turned cynical ."
"`` ah , but you did . ''"
"she shook her head , denying the truth of what he was saying ."
"`` that 's simply not possible . ''"
"`` not only is it possible , it is an absolute ."
"which means that baby you are carrying is the next in line to rule . ''"
"she blinked at his words , not really understanding their meaning for a long moment ."
"`` baby ?"
"i 'm not carrying a baby , '' she squeaked ."
"his mouth turned hard ."
"`` do n't lie to me , danielle ."
"you were seen walking out of an obstetrician 's office ."
"initially you were excited , then overwhelmed if the pictures are to be believed . ''"
"she really did n't like the sound of that ."
"`` pictures ?"
"you had me followed ? ''"
"`` absolutely , '' he answered ."
"`` we had unprotected sex . ''"
"he had to grit out the words as he said them ."
"`` and the consequences are your current condition . ''"
"`` but , kalil , '' she started , her hand covering her stomach , `` i was at the obstetrician 's office for my friend carrie ."
"she 's the one having the baby . ''"
"`` is that also why you are making a baby 's blanket ? ''"
"he countered , one eyebrow raised cynically ."
"dani glanced down at her lap where the blanket was now resting , no longer folded but crumpled in a heap ."
"`` yes , '' she said , folding the blanket , needing to hide her shaking hands ."
"`` actually , i made it for her . ''"
"he did n't answer her for a long time ."
"`` are you sure you 're not pregnant ?"
"and would you tell me if you were ? ''"
"dani stared at his handsome face that was set in grim , determined lines ."
"`` a baby ?"
"would i tell you if i were pregnant with your baby ? ''"
"`` exactly ."
"and are you sure you 're not pregnant ?"
"would you confirm that with a pregnancy test ? ''"
"`` are you calling me a liar ? ''"
"`` i 'm saying we had unprotected sex seven days ago ."
"i have word that you were at an obstetrician 's office and you 're now holding a baby 's blanket , in addition to pictures of you shopping for baby furniture ."
"all evidence would point to a different conclusion than you are allowing ."
"although most women would be spouting the opposite so i 'll concede that i 'm a little confused . ''"
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"`` i mean , that several women have tried to convince me that they were pregnant when they were not ."
"i believe you might be different and convince me that you are not pregnant , when you are . ''"
"dani sat back and crossed her arms over her chest ."
"`` are n't you the most insulting man i 've ever met ! ''"
"she exclaimed ."
"`` and arrogant , not to mention conceited . ''"
"`` now that you 've vented , please answer my question . ''"
"`` no , i 'm not pregnant ."
"and no , i wo n't be subjected to a pregnancy test ."
"and yes , i do consider you painfully insulting . ''"
"`` how do you know you 're not pregnant ? ''"
"`` i know ! ''"
"`` how ? ''"
"dani hesitated because she did n't actually know ."
"it was still too early to know if she was or not since her period was n't due until next week ."
"she had n't even considered the possibility , too wrapped up in her anger to think beyond getting through her classes and fighting the humiliating memories of those messengers ."
"`` i see you 've finally come to the realization that it is a possibility , '' he said curtly ."
"`` we will be arriving in basir in a few hours ."
"at that time , we will endeavor to find an answer to our question . ''"
"`` i will not be subjected to a pregnancy test ."
"have n't you put me through enough humiliation already ? ''"
"`` then we will be married immediately , '' he said calmly and stood up to answer the phone ."
"`` married ? ''"
"danni said , horrified of that possibility ."
"`` why on earth would we get married ? ''"
"`` if you wo n't consider the possibility , then we must be married ."
"i do n't want my children to think they were conceived out of wedlock ."
"no marks can be made against my children and the future heir of basir . ''"
"`` i ca n't marry you ! ''"
"`` why not ? ''"
"`` because , you 're royalty ."
"and i 'm , '' she hesitated , trying to define who she was ."
"`` i 'm a teacher . ''"
"`` i admit that my people would never accept you as the queen but only because of your nationality and not because of your profession ."
"the marriage would only be for a short time ."
"we will divorce once the child is born which will be long enough to legitimize his right to the throne ."
"you may stay on at the palace or return to london , whichever is your wish , '' he explained matter of factly ."
"`` leave my child ?"
"are you crazy ? ''"
"again , the small tilt to his lips indicated a possible smile but it never came out in full force ."
"`` i do n't believe that adjective has been applied to me lately but you are working through many epithets , i 'm sure you 'll send that one my way again very soon . ''"
"`` you are crazy ! ''"
"she exclaimed ."
"`` you may also stay on at the palace or a residence nearby ."
"that is your choice . ''"
"she stared at his handsome face , trying to grasp everything he had just told her ."
"it was like her life had turned into some sort of macabre play and she was in the audience shaking her head , unbelieving of the unrealistic plot ."
"`` let me get this straight ."
"we make love one night , you insult me by sending me money as if i were some sort of hired help to be paid off , now you think i 'm pregnant so you kidnap me and threaten to take this theoretical child away from me . ''"
"she glared at him as he sat calmly in front of him , not showing any emotion to her summarization ."
"`` does that cover everything ? ''"
"`` you 've put an interesting spin on the situation , '' he said and stood up , walking over to a small refrigerator and pulled out a bottle ."
"while pouring two drinks , he looked at her briefly ."
"`` how about if i try ? ''"
"she did n't respond but crossed her arms over her chest , continuing to glare at him ."
"`` we met and made love , both of us involved and neither one remembering about contraceptives , i had a nice evening and wanted to show you how much so i sent you a gift ."
"now i realize that there might have been consequences and i 'm preparing to keep you in the height of luxury with every conceivable comfort for the rest of your days while our ... what was the term you used ? ''"
"he hesitated before continuing and handed her a drink of ice cold juice , `` ah yes , 'theoretical ' child , becomes one of the wealthiest , best educated and most powerful man in the world ."
"oh , and do n't forget that i 've offered you my name and protection as well as many more nights like the one we shared last week where we lose ourselves in each other , finding more and more ways to pleasure the other , understanding that our bodies have a need for the other that is inescapable , '' he said , more softly and closer to her ear ."
"he sat back and noticed her breathing had become rapid , her breasts were swollen just at the thought of the nights with him and her nipples hardened even as he glanced down and noticed ."
"she covered her breasts , wishing he did n't have this affect on her but his soft , deep chuckle only told her that he was n't fooled ."
"`` what if the baby is a girl ? ''"
"kalil smiled at this point , liking her spunk and daring ."
"`` if it is a girl , she will be revered in our culture as no other woman could be , '' he said ."
"`` she will also be educated in the best schools and loved . ''"
"`` but not the most powerful ? ''"
"`` women are gaining a powerful place in society ."
"i would expect my daughters to help other women fight for more equality . ''"
"`` that 's an interesting statement coming from a man who just kidnapped a woman . ''"
"kalil shook his head ."
"`` i am only protecting you ."
"there are parties who would harm you in order to gain succession to the throne . ''"
"dani had n't thought of that ."
"`` perhaps we should have discussed this prior to saturday night , '' she said , becoming intimidated again ."
"`` perhaps there were many things that we should have discussed ."
"but that did n't happen ."
"now we deal with the current situation . ''"
"`` i think i 'll take my chances on my own , '' she said , lifting her head ."
"`` no one has to know that the baby is yours ."
"and i promise never to tell anyone ."
"you have my word on that . ''"
"`` only a few moments ago , you were horrified when i suggested you leave your baby in the palace under my care and return to england ."
"now you make the statement that i forget my child ."
"interesting ."
"and irrelevant , '' he stated firmly when she started to speak ."
"`` regardless of these issues , you are carrying a child of royal blood ."
"my blood ."
"it will be raised to rule basir , '' he said ."
"the phone rang at that moment and he lifted it , listening for a long moment before putting it down ."
"`` i 'm afraid i must deal with several issues my advisors have brought up ."
"if you will excuse me , i 'll be back shortly ."
"there is a bed through those doors if you become tired and i 'll be back for dinner . ''"
"without another word , he moved down the stairs and disappeared , leaving dani sitting in the luxurious setting looking bewildered ."
"she covered her stomach , wondering if it was possible that she really was pregnant ."
"but then she remembered carrie 's attempts and knew that it was a pretty remote possibility ."
"it was her first time having sex ."
"she knew it happened but it was improbable in her case ."
"chapter 6 dani walked off the plane behind kalil , shading her eyes from the intense sun beating down on them ."
"she was led to a limousine surrounded by a police escort ."
"kalil escorted dani to the middle limousine but discussed something in arabic with another passenger , leaving her completely out of the conversation ."
"at the palace , kalil escorted her inside but that was the extent of her communication with him ."
"`` this is alea ."
"she will be your personal assistant , '' he said and then walked off in the opposite direction ."
"dani watched him until he was out of sight ."
"then she turned to find her `` assistant '' standing in front of her , waiting patiently ."
"`` may i show you to your rooms ? ''"
"she asked ."
"dani was shown to a suite of rooms ."
"there was a living room that was about ten times the size of her tiny apartment , and a bathroom at least twice the size ."
"the sunken bath itself was larger than her bed and it was already filled with warm , soapy water ."
"it looked fabulously inviting but she resisted ."
"she did n't tell alea anything but thanked her politely and waited for her to leave ."
"searching through her purse , dani was horrified to find that she only had a few euros in her wallet ."
"she still had her credit cards but she was n't sure if they would be widely accepted ."
"she just needed to get to the embassy and she would be okay , she told herself ."
"there , they could help her get on a plane and she could get back to her own life ."
"once she was able to confirm to kalil that she was n't pregnant , she was sure he would be grateful that she did n't stick around for long ."
"slipping out of the room , she looked down the long corridor , wondering if anyone would stop her ."
"if she appeared casual , she suspected that everyone would assume she was where she was supposed to be ."
"tucking the blanket under one arm and feeling silly for still having it with her , she moved forward with purpose , retracing her steps as best she could ."
"whenever she reached a place that did n't seem familiar , she simply turned around and backtracked until she was in familiar territory again ."
"but after forty five minutes of walking , she realized that many of the corridors looked familiar simply because she 'd already been lost in them before ."
"it was only by some miracle that she ended up in the entry hall that she 'd initially been abandoned by kalil a long time ago ."
"dani tentatively opened the front door only to find several guards standing in front of it ."
"they all glanced up at her , inquiringly but none said a word ."
"so dani braved through and just started walking ."
"there was sunlight which meant she was outside ."
"that was progress , was n't it ?"
"it was n't until she reached a cement wall that she realized why no one had stopped her ."
"she was in a small courtyard with no way out ."
"walking back into the palace was embarrassing , but the guards politely opened the door for her , allowing her re-entry ."
"and there stood kalil , his arms crossed over his chest waiting for her ."
"`` looking for something ? ''"
"he asked arrogantly , one eyebrow raised enquiringly ."
"dani just leaned against the heavy doors , fighting back tears of frustration ."
"`` yes ! ''"
"kalil relented , walking towards her and looking gently down into her eyes ."
"`` i 'm sorry the suite of rooms was not to your liking ."
"we will find something else , '' he said and put a hand at the small of her back ."
"`` are you hungry ? ''"
"he asked ."
"dani hated to admit it , but she was famished ."
"shaking her head , she did n't want to accept anything from him ."
"`` no , thank you ."
"but if you are hungry , please do n't let me keep you from your dinner , '' she said , not bothering to look at him ."
"`` but i insist that you join me , '' he said , and a few more feet they were back at her rooms ."
"alea was standing in the center of the room , nervously wringing her hands ."
"she was even more terrified when kalil walked in ."
"immediately bowing low , she spoke softly in arabic and it sounded suspiciously like an apology ."
"kalil spoke back and dismissed the woman who quickly left the room ."
"he had n't spoken harshly , but dani imagined that even softly spoken words from kalil could be lethal in some cases ."
"`` what did you say to her ? ''"
"she asked , sitting down in one of the silk covered chairs ."
"`` i told her to leave , '' he explained and walked over to her , took her hand and led her to the courtyard that was now cooling off with the setting sun ."
"there was a lovely table filled with white roses , candle light and silver covered plates ."
"`` are you sure you are n't hungry ? ''"
"he asked , dropping her hand and picking up one of the covers ."
"an amazing aroma wafted to her and dani could n't stop her stomach from letting him know that she was indeed hungry ."
"`` no , thank you , '' she said , ignoring the food in favor of stepping back into the shadows ."
"`` please enjoy your meal . ''"
"`` i would enjoy it more if you would eat it with me . ''"
"`` that 's generous , but no thank you , '' she repeated ."
"she turned to leave but his voice stopped her ."
"`` you ca n't leave the palace , danielle , '' he said , voicing her worst fears ."
"`` why ? ''"
"`` because you are under my protection ."
"no one will allow you to leave . ''"
"`` because of today ? ''"
"`` no , if you had been in danger of coming close to an exit , someone would have stopped you immediately , '' he said , sitting down in one of the chairs by the table ."
"`` luckily , you were not in danger , '' he said simply ."
"`` please sit down ."
"if this food does n't tempt you , then i 'll have the chef prepare something else ."
"you just have to name it and it will be done . ''"
"`` i do n't want anything from you , '' she said emphatically ."
"`` i want to go home now . ''"
"`` this will be your new home for however long you want ."
"after the baby is born , a respectable amount of time will have to pass before we can divorce but you do n't need to live here during that period unless you choose to . ''"
"`` that 's impossible ! ''"
"kalil stood up and sighed deeply ."
"taking her hands in his , he led her back over to the table ."
"with one fork , he lifted it to her mouth ."
"when she would n't open for him , he rubbed his thumb sensuously along her lips which parted automatically , with the persuasion ."
"he fed her a bite of a delicious cheese , the flavor bursting in her mouth as he said , `` danielle , just try and relax ."
"i am sure you can enjoy your time here , '' he said , then picked up another bite ."
"dani could n't take it anymore ."
"the flavors were so wonderful and she really was hungry ."
"closing her eyes , she savored the tastes , loving the way the food slid down her throat and warmed her inside ."
"he fed her more food , interspersed with feeding himself ."
"`` i still do n't like you , '' she said between mouthfuls , but she sat down in one of the chairs and filled her plate ."
"`` you 're manipulative and man . ''"
"kalil chuckled as he sat down opposite from her ."
"`` tell me about your work ."
"why do you like being a teacher ? ''"
"he asked ."
"dani did n't want to eat in silence , so she relented and spoke of her children , the classes and what parts of the work she liked , loved or hated ."
"he was a good listener , she thought as the delicious food filled her aching stomach ."
"she relaxed and sipped ice water , laughing as he told her stories of his education ."
"he was very charming , she thought as the plates were cleared away and a sweet , warm dessert was brought in by mysterious servants ."
"how they knew the meal was over , she had no idea but she was also too tired to worry about it ."
"`` you must sleep , '' he said about an hour later , their laughter at one of his stories dying down and an awkward silence following ."
"he stood up and took her hand , pulling her to her feet ."
"`` thank you for sharing your meal with me , '' he said softly , looking into her eyes as if he were searching for some answers ."
"dani did n't know what the question was , but she did n't like feeling this small and vulnerable ."
"he was too tall and too muscular and she wanted to run away and hide somewhere ."
"somewhere that her body could hide the betraying feelings she was experiencing ."
"she did n't want him to fold her into his strong arms and carry her over to the bed ."
"she did n't want him to kiss her and make her forget all the worries that were ricocheting around in her brain ."
"she wanted to be oblivious and just his soft touch around her fingers was sending sparks up her arm , indicating that the intensity of their passion was still there , bubbling under the surface ."
"stepping back , she smile self-consciously ."
"`` thank you for dinner ."
"it was truly delicious . ''"
"`` you 're very welcome . ''"
"he lifted her hand and kissed her wrist , his eyes watching the expression on her face as she gasped with the explosion that shot up her arm , her eyes looking up at his , terrified now that he would do more , but also praying that he would continue ."
"`` good night , '' he said softly ."
"dani watched him leave , her body vibrating with sexual tension from his soft kiss and the promise of what could be if she 'd just let it ."
"she was glad he 'd left , she told herself as she brushed her teeth and got ready for bed ."
"she was not in the market for a husband right now , and especially one that had the power to kidnap her with impunity ."
"no , kalil was not in her league and she was not going to fall under his spell ."
"chapter 7 `` good morning ! ''"
"alea greeted , waking dani up out of her comfortable dream where she was making love to kalil and he was professing his intense love for her ."
"she rolled over and opened her eyes , allowing the bright sunshine to disperse the remains of her unrealistic fantasy ."
"`` it is morning ."
"i 'm just not sure if it is good or not , '' dani said , wondering how alea could be so bright and cheerful ."
"`` what time is it ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` it is nine o'clock in the morning ."
"his highness has requested that you breakfast with him as soon as you are awake , '' she said , walking back from a closet and handing dani a robe ."
"`` where did that come from ? ''"
"dani asked , eyeing the crystal blue satin with a malicious glare ."
"`` it is yours ! ''"
"she exclaimed , holding out the robe for dani to wear ."
"`` many clothes arrived early this morning ."
"i have already placed them in your closet , '' she said , smiling brightly ."
"`` my clothes ? ''"
"dani replied , shocked ."
"`` but i did n't bring any clothes . ''"
"`` these are all new clothes , arriving from all over the world , ' she exclaimed ."
"`` it was all arranged yesterday . ''"
"`` is that so ? ''"
"dani was too grumpy to worry about clothes ."
"they were so minor in comparison to the rest of the issues that were piling up ."
"there was also the issue that her period was due any day now ."
"worrying about it would only delay the onset so she had to relax ."
"she considered just getting a pregnancy test but each time she 'd thought about it at night , she rejected it ."
"she was not going to be dictated to by that overbearing man ."
"`` you have an appointment with a dressmaker this morning right after breakfast with his highness , and then arabic lessons this afternoon . ''"
"`` arabic lessons ?"
"dress maker ?"
"what are you talking about ? ''"
"dani demanded ."
"she was trying to be polite since alea was only the messenger but things were rolling out of control ."
"`` yes !"
"is n't that wonderful ? ''"
"`` that 's one word to describe it . ''"
"alea 's smile faltered slightly but she perked right back up ."
"`` i 'll go run your bath , '' she said and disappeared into the marble bathroom ."
"dani sat back down on the edge of the bed , trying to assimilate everything that was happening ."
"she was basically a captive in this gilded cage ."
"there must be some way she could get out ."
"she just needed to think hard enough ."
"pushing her hair off her face , she looked around ."
"the room really was lovely and the courtyard was filled with beautiful flowers and a trickling fountain that soothed the soul ."
"it would be wonderful to give in and just savor the time here ."
"but a part of her knew that the surroundings were never the problem ."
"it was being around kalil and the wonderful things he could make her feel with very little effort on his part ."
"he probably had a harem somewhere ."
"and if not a harem , then mistresses all over the world and women throwing themselves at him ."
"he was too gorgeous for anything less ."
"how was she supposed to compete with all those other women ?"
"staying here would only mean heartache and dani had never considered herself a masochist ."
"she just needed to be more creative in her escape methods , she thought ."
"perhaps if she started to learn more about the palace , she would learn more about its escape routes ."
"and who would know better than alea what was going on within the palace walls , and out of them ?"
"dani followed alea into the bathroom , feeling self-conscience of becoming naked around the other woman ."
"she was throwing scented powder into the large tub ."
"when alea saw dani , she smiled brightly again and bowed ."
"`` just call me when you are finished ."
"i 'll get your clothes ready , '' she said and disappeared into the other room ."
"dani was grateful for the privacy and she sunk into the wonderfully warm water , lowering herself to her neck ."
"the water felt perfect and she allowed herself to float carefree for a long time , just reveling in the luxury of the scents and silky feel of the water ."
"after fifteen minutes , she stepped out and showered , rinsing off all the bubbles and shampooing her hair ."
"alea had chosen a lavender pantsuit that brought out the color of her eyes and the soft brown of her hair ."
"alea even twisted dani 's hair into a complicated knot that made dani feel incredibly sophisticated ."
"with just a touch of makeup , dani felt confident enough to face even the prince of basir ."
"she walked into the long office area of the palace where alea had said kalil was working and they would have breakfast ."
"she felt odd stepping into what was really just a male domain with heavy furniture and dark colors ."
"but as soon as she stepped in , kalil stopped the conference he was having with several other men and walked over to where she was standing ."
"`` you look lovely , '' he said , taking her hands in his ."
"for a moment , dani thought he was going to bend down and kiss her and her whole body was yearning for just that ."
"then , as soon as the last man closed the door , he did just that ."
"but it was n't the short , simple kiss she 'd been expecting ."
"it was a long , sensuous kiss that emptied her mind of everything but his lips and his breath caressing her cheek ."
"`` you slept well ? ''"
"he whispered in her ear ."
"dani could only nod her head , closing her eyes and wishing her dream was reality ."
"she cleared her throat , opened her eyes and stepped backwards out of his arms ."
"the extra space helped her recover her senses and she was able to answer coherently ."
"`` yes ."
"thank you very much ."
"i understand you 've asked me to join you for breakfast . ''"
"kalil smiled in amusement ."
"`` that was about two hours ago ."
"i 'm starving , '' he said and pressed a button on his desk ."
"immediately , a servant pushed in a tray covered with white linen and breakfast foods , then just as quickly left them alone ."
"he led her over to the chairs placed near a large , palladian window , then sat down across from her ."
"`` have you thought anymore about our situation ? ''"
"he asked , pouring coffee for the two of them ."
"`` yes ."
"i 've thought about it , then get angry again so i stop thinking about it , '' she said as calmly as possible ."
"if he could feign indifference , so could she ."
"`` and ? ''"
"`` and i 'm still convinced that you are wrong in this situation . ''"
"kalil laughed softly ."
"`` you 're very refreshing , danielle . ''"
"she eyed him over the rim of her china coffee cup ."
"`` i 'm guessing not many people tell you you 're wrong , right ? ''"
"he shook his head ."
"`` no one has told me i 'm wrong . ''"
"`` then it is high time someone brought you down a peg or two . ''"
"`` and you think you 're the person to do that ? ''"
"`` absolutely ."
"when is my flight home ? ''"
"he popped a strawberry in his mouth and chewed , watching her the whole time ."
"`` you need to learn to be more round about when you approach something ."
"it is an art , conversation ."
"why not start with the pleasantries and work your way towards your issues ."
"subtlety is also a virtue . ''"
"`` that 's a wonderful lesson in culture but you forget , i 'm not from your culture ."
"and i do n't want to be ."
"i want to go home to my own culture ."
"if you do n't like me , then send me home as i 've asked . ''"
"`` who says i do n't like you ? ''"
"he replied , looking at her lips , then dropping his gaze down to her breasts covered in the soft , silk sweater ."
"`` i can assure you , danielle , there are many things about you i like ."
"i believe that 's the whole reason for our ... .situation . ''"
"`` stop doing that ! ''"
"she said , struggling to keep herself from covering her breasts ."
"`` what ? ''"
"he asked , looking at her innocently ."
"`` stop remembering how wonderful it was to be with you ?"
"to kiss every inch of your body and hear your sighs of longing ?"
"to feel you move beneath me or to feel the softness of your body close around mine ? ''"
"`` stop it ! ''"
"she demanded , her hands clenched in fists on her lap ."
"`` why ?"
"i want that again . ''"
"`` no !"
"we ca n't do that ."
"we can never do that again ."
"i do n't want this world and you do n't really want me ."
"you just want any woman who is available ."
"i was just too naive to understand what you really wanted but in reality , any woman will do , wo n't she ?"
"you do n't just want me , just a willing body . ''"
"`` you 're wrong , danielle but i can tell that i wo n't be able to convince you of that right now ."
"why do n't we change the subject ?"
"we 'll return to our mutual desire for each other later ."
"right now , you were telling me how much you like your rooms and are eager to start learning my language , correct ? ''"
"`` you are impossible , '' she said and stood up ."
"she was about to turn around but she swayed , her mind losing balance and becoming dizzy ."
"`` danielle !"
"what is wrong ? ''"
"he demanded , standing up and wrapping his arms around her waist ."
"`` nothing , '' she said , putting her hand against her forehead ."
"`` i 'm just hungry , that 's all , '' she explained ."
"`` i 'll go find something to eat , '' she said and tried to slip out of his embrace ."
"`` you 'll do no such thing ."
"sit down now and eat something here where i can be assured that you 're actually eating . ''"
"dani would have argued , but she was n't sure her legs could carry her out of the room so she sank down gratefully onto the comfortable leather chair she 'd just jumped up out of ."
"her mind was finally clearing when kalil placed a plate piled high with fruit and several pastries ."
"she looked up just in time to hear him press the button on his desk again ."
"when the servant entered instantly , kalil gave him and order to which he bowed quickly and departed ."
"`` something more substantial will be brought to you immediately ."
"please eat the fruit while it is being prepared . ''"
"dani did n't argue this time ."
"she really was hungry ."
"last night 's dinner was delicious but it was almost noon and she had n't eaten anything yet ."
"the fruit was incredibly sweet and the pastries were light and buttery ."
"the whole time she ate , kalil asked her questions about her past , her education , her fiance which dani finally explained was her ex-fiance now ."
"a plate of delicious smelling eggs arrived and dani tried to eat some of them but after the fruit and pastries , she really was full ."
"`` thank you , kalil ."
"i appreciate the breakfast but i 've taken up enough of your time ."
"can we please discuss what i 'm doing here ? ''"
"`` i think we 've already covered that , '' he said gently but his eyes showed no possibility of relenting ."
"`` i 'm not willing to accept your dictate on the issue . ''"
"`` i understand ."
"i wonder who is going to win in this situation ? ''"
"dani did n't like the confidence in his voice ."
"`` this is ridiculous . ''"
"`` i agree , and i would love to continue this conversation but unfortunately , i am expected in another meeting ."
"perhaps we could talk over dinner tonight ? ''"
"he asked , pulling her to her feet and holding both her hands in his ."
"`` i 'll check my calendar to see if i have any free time , '' she said , trying to pull her hands out of his ."
"kalil laughed ."
"`` you do that . ''"
"he bent over and kissed her cheek gently ."
"`` and we 'll discuss the other topic as well , if you can spare the time , '' he said ."
"he left a moment later and dani was standing alone in his office , staring at the now closed door and wondering what she was supposed to do with her time until evening ."
"alea !"
"dani remembered her plan to ask her new assistant about the palace and figure out how to get out of her predicament ."
"dani left kalil 's office by a different route than he 'd taken and found her way back to the suite of rooms she 'd been given ."
"thankfully , alea was there , putting away several new outfits ."
"`` where did those come from ? ''"
"dani asked warily as alea snipped the tags off of them and hung them up into a cavernous closet ."
"alea 's bright and sunny personality did n't disappoint ."
"`` they arrived for you this morning , '' she said and turned to face dani ."
"`` is there anything i can do for you ? ''"
"dani nodded her head ."
"no time like the present , she thought ."
"`` yes ."
"i was wondering if you could give me a tour of the palace ."
"i almost got lost on my way back here and would like a better tour so i know where i 'm going . ''"
"`` my pleasure , '' she said and led the way down one of the long hallways ."
"alea was wonderfully knowledgeable about the architecture of the palace as well as what all the rooms were for and who worked where ."
"she knew just about everyone in the palace and , at dani 's insistence , introduced dani to them ."
"alea whispered that it did n't seem appropriate for dani to be introduced in that fashion but dani just shook her head ."
"`` i do n't really abide by a hierarchy , if you must know ."
"if kalil does n't like it , he can send me back to england . ''"
"`` kalil ? ''"
"dani waived her hand , `` i think you refer to him as 'your highness ' or some other odd thing . ''"
"`` ah , '' she replied , looking embarrassed ."
"`` never mind , '' dani said , knowing she had stepped over some invisible line within the palace ."
"`` what 's next ? ''"
"she prompted ."
"they spent the rest of the morning going through the hallways , touring the gardens and dani genuinely enjoyed learning more about what happens at the palace and how it had been built over several centuries and many different rulers ."
"dani also asked alea to teach her small phrases in arabic ."
"by the end of the hour , dani knew how to ask for the bathroom , say hello , goodbye and other small phrases that would be completely useless to her ."
"but she also asked alea to come back later in the afternoon to do a formal arabic lesson ."
"`` i would be more than happy to teach you but i will also notify his highness that you need a formal tutor , '' she said ."
"`` no ! ''"
"dani cried out ."
"alea almost jumped at dani 's exclamation ."
"`` sorry , '' dani said , shaking her head in alea 's direction ."
"`` please do n't tell kalil that i 'm learning ."
"i really do n't want him to know yet . ''"
"`` but why ? ''"
"she asked , her eyes showing her confusion ."
"`` it would only please him to know that you are learning ."
"i think he would be very happy . ''"
"`` i understand that the rest of the palace revolves around kalil 's happiness but i do n't want to be one of those people , '' dani said ."
"`` you mentioned some stables ?"
"if you 'll tell me which way to go , i 'll find my way , if that is okay to do . ''"
"`` of course , '' alea said ."
"`` but i would be more than happy to show you the way . ''"
"`` no , thank you ."
"i 'd just like to wander down and see be alone for a little while , '' dani explained ."
"alea nodded and gave dani directions ."
"`` but if you wait , i 'll bring you a hat , '' she said ."
"you 're skin is probably not used to the sun , '' she said and rushed off before dani could respond ."
"she returned only moments later with a large , brimmed hat ."
"dani obediently put it on her head , knowing that her pale skin would burn easily in the summer sun ."
"`` thank you alea ."
"i 'm glad you thought of that , '' she said and turned in the direction alea had mentioned ."
"on her walk down to the stables , she looked around , noting the various courtyards and palace traffic ."
"everyone seemed extremely busy , with a purpose and skip to their step ."
"dani was the only one that was strolling aimlessly along ."
"what would she be doing at home ?"
"lesson plans ."
"lunches with friends , cleaning up her classroom ."
"there was n't anything urgent over the summer , she knew ."
"that did n't mean she wanted to stay down here though ."
"as she walked through the covered sidewalks towards the stables , dani held the hat by her side and practiced the arabic phrases she 'd learned , concentrating on her pronunciation ."
"if she 'd been looking up instead of down at the ground , she would have seen the large frame that came bolting out of the side doors , right into her ."
"`` excuse me ! ''"
"dani said and was held steady in strong arms ."
"she instantly shivered and knew who the arms belonged to before she even looked up into kalil 's dark features ."
"`` i 'm sorry , '' he said , still holding her arms and looking down into her angry eyes ."
"`` where are you headed ? ''"
"`` to the stables ."
"is that allowed ? ''"
"`` are you going to ride a horse ? ''"
"he asked , his eyes instantly showing his concern ."
"dani laughed softly ."
"`` no ."
"i do n't know how to ride a horse ."
"but i thought it would be nice to just see them ."
"i was told you have prize thoroughbreds and arabians in your stables ."
"i wanted to peek at what that kind of a horse looks like . ''"
"`` ah !"
"well you 're in luck , '' he said , his eyes concentrating on her lips ."
"`` i 'm on my way down to the stables as well ."
"one of my mares is about to give birth and i was going to check on her ."
"may i accompany you ? ''"
"dani frowned ."
"`` is the mare okay ? ''"
"`` i think so , '' he said to allay her fears ."
"`` but come with me , '' he said and put a hand on the small of her back to guide her along ."
"`` we 'll see together . ''"
"`` thank you , '' dani said and fell into step beside her ."
"`` i 'm surprised you have the time to check on a horse , '' she said as way of conversation ."
"`` why would n't i ? ''"
"`` are n't you ruling a country or something like that ? ''"
"`` something like that ."
"but i take time out occasionally from my duties . ''"
"`` that seems odd for some reason , '' she said , smiling despite herself ."
"`` i guess i always thought of people in your kind of position always ruling , never really taking a break . ''"
"`` of course we take a break ."
"we 'd go insane if we did n't ."
"everyone has to have distractions , '' he said ."
"they 'd reached the stables by then and he opened the heavy door to the spanish looking building ."
"it was n't like the stables back home she 'd seen when driving through the country with stones or wood and hay strewn about ."
"this stable was better maintained than some apartment complexes ."
"the horses were all housed in immaculate stalls with brass name plates and there were trainers or other workers busily moving about the area ."
"most horses were either being groomed or were out in a large field , friskily running around the perimeters ."
"kalil walked up to one stall with several people around it ."
"he stepped in and dani saw a proud beauty with soft , brown eyes that was laying on her side , breathing heavily ."
"everyone spoke in arabic and dani did n't understand a word but after kalil spoke with what she assumed was the head trainer or perhaps the veterinarian , he waved her into the stall ."
"`` would you like to pet her ? ''"
"he asked , bending down to stroke the mare 's nose and neck , speaking soothing words to her ."
"`` no , thank you , '' dani said and stepped back again , genuinely nervous around an animal that large and in such pain ."
"`` why is she breathing so heavily ?"
"is that normal ? ''"
"kalil smiled ."
"`` it is when a horse is about to give birth , '' he said and gave the horse one last pat before standing up and joining her ."
"`` it will be a few more hours , '' he said ."
"`` hours ? ''"
"dani whispered in fear for the horse that was throwing her head back in obvious pain ."
"`` ca n't you do something to help her ?"
"drugs or something ? ''"
"`` a horse ca n't talk like a woman ."
"so we ca n't give her drugs ."
"otherwise , she would n't be able to push the foal out . ''"
"dani stepped back , grabbing kalil 's hands inadvertently ."
"`` you have to help her ! ''"
"she demanded ."
"kalil chuckled and guided her out of the stall ."
"`` why are you afraid of horses ? ''"
"dani grimaced and looked up at him ."
"`` possibly because they are extremely large animals with equally large teeth and hard hooves . ''"
"`` but horses are very kind animals if you treat them well . ''"
"`` i 'll trust you on that claim . ''"
"`` nonsense , come over here and see for yourself , '' he said , and led her to another stall ."
"dani went , but not very willingly ."
"`` i was kind of hoping that i could see these wonderful creatures from a distance ."
"is n't that possible ? ''"
"`` yes but not nearly as satisfying , '' he countered ."
"once he reached another large stall , he opened the top half of the gate and whistled ."
"immediately a horse trotted over to kalil 's open hand , nuzzling him affectionately ."
"he spoke to her softly in arabic , petting his neck and flanks ."
"`` come , see solomon for yourself . ''"
"dani shook his head ."
"`` i 'll trust you , '' she replied , but her eyes watched his hands , noting the long fingers and the gentle touch , how the horse moved into kalil 's hands and asked for more ."
"dani knew it was crazy , but she was actually jealous of the horse ."
"she wanted kalil 's hands on her , touching her neck , stroking her , making her feel wonderful ."
"this was absolutely insane , she told herself for the second time today ."
"over breakfast , he had used words to reduce her to a quivering mass of desire ."
"now , he was n't even trying and she wanted him desperately , was even jealous of a beast of a horse because he was getting more attention than she was ."
"`` have you ever ridden a horse ? ''"
"he asked abruptly ."
"dani snapped out of her hypnotic state and glanced up at him ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"she asked , feeling her face warm when she had n't heard his question ."
"kalil did n't comment , but raised one eyebrow to indicate that he was curious about her reaction ."
"`` i asked if you 'd ever ridden a horse before . ''"
"`` oh !"
"ah ... no ."
"and i do n't think that is an experience i really want . ''"
"`` but this ca n't be , '' he said softly ."
"he raised one hand slightly and a stable hand appeared as if by magic ."
"kalil gave the man instructions and dani watched in horror as the man led another horse out into a large area and saddled her ."
"`` kalil , i 'm not sure what you have in mind , but if it has anything to with me on top of that horse , you can just forget about it , '' she said , backing up several steps ."
"`` trust me ? ''"
"he said and walked so he was standing directly in front of her , blocking the view of the man saddling the horse ."
"`` no , '' she said , peeking around kalil 's broad shoulders to determine how much time she had before the real battle would begin ."
"`` yes you do , '' he countered ."
"she stopped looking around him and glared up into his amused face ."
"`` kalil , why in the world would i trust you ?"
"you 've kidnapped me here simply because i may , and i would like to emphasize the extremely remote possibility , be pregnant with your child which , according to you , must be raised here in basir and no other place in the world will do ."
"so tell me exactly how and why i should trust you ."
"because so far , i have n't seen or experienced much to engender that feeling yet . ''"
"his smile only broadened ."
"`` in time , you will learn to trust me ."
"and this will be your first lesson , '' he explained ."
"he turned around and the horse was already saddled ."
"kalil took her hands in his and gently led her over to the patiently waiting horse ."
"`` kalil , i am not getting on that horse ! ''"
"she said adamantly , trying to free her hands from his and back up ."
"kalil only smiled slightly , then lifted her up onto the horse ."
"dani was shocked to find herself sitting on the horse ."
"she looked down at kalil and tried to swing her leg back over the horse ."
"`` please do n't do this , '' she pleaded but he only put a hand on her upper thigh ."
"`` how are you going to learn to trust me if you are n't patient ? ''"
"a moment later , he swung up behind her , pulling her back and bottom firmly against his chest and hips ."
"`` relax , '' he said softly into her ear ."
"dani wished she could obey but the heat coming from his body was too much ."
"her body was responding to the tension and it was building , making her stomach coil with wanting ."
"then the horse moved ."
"it was only a slow walk at first and kalil put his arm around her waist , holding her securely while his other hand controlled the reigns ."
"`` what are you doing ? ''"
"she asked breathlessly ."
"`` i 'm taking you for a ride on daisy . ''"
"`` daisy ? ''"
"she laughed despite her nervousness ."
"`` you have a horse named daisy ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"why is that so hard to believe ?"
"does n't she look like a 'daisy ' to you ? ''"
"they were now walking out into the sunshine and kalil called out an order to someone else ."
"immediately a hand appeared ."
"it was n't the large , wide-brimmed hat that alea had given her but it was smaller , with just enough of a brim to keep the sun off the front of her face but still very comfortable ."
"`` thank you , '' she said , pulling the hat low on her forehead to keep as much of the sun off as possible ."
"`` and no , this large animal does not in any way resemble any daisy i 've ever seen ."
"so why did you name her daisy ?"
"and whose horse is she ? ''"
"`` she used to belong to my sister before she married last year . ''"
"`` i did n't know you had a sister , '' she said , surprised ."
"`` i have three , all of them married ."
"i have parents too , just in case you were wondering . ''"
"`` you do ? ''"
"`` my father is still living but my mother died five years ago . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry , '' she said , turning so she could look up into his face ."
"she knew that losing a parent was one of the worst experiences ."
"and she 'd lost both of hers four years ago in a car accident ."
"kalil looked down at her , his eyes noting her sincere expression ."
"`` thank you , '' he said ."
"`` what do your sisters do ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` they are married , '' he replied as if that answered her question ."
"`` yes , but do they work ? ''"
"`` no , why would they ? ''"
"he asked , and turned the horse to an area filled with large rocks and desert ."
"`` why would n't they ? ''"
"she countered ."
"`` because they are married . ''"
"dani sighed and shook her head ."
"`` so i guess you are one of those men who think a woman 's life is complete once she finds a man to take care of her ? ''"
"`` of course ."
"my mother 's life was raising her four children . ''"
"`` what would happen if you married someone who wanted a career outside of her marriage ?"
"what if raising your children is n't fulfilling enough ? ''"
"`` then i will make sure it is , '' he said ."
"`` what if you ca n't ?"
"what if she feels she has something more to offer than just acting as a baby machine for her husband 's dynasty ? ''"
"he looked down at her enigmatically ."
"`` since you will be my wife , albeit for a short duration , are you concerned that your time as my wife will be boring ? ''"
"`` since i 'm not going to be your wife because i 'm most likely not pregnant , i 'm just asking questions out of curiosity . ''"
"`` but if you are pregnant , you will marry me . ''"
"dani hesitated for a long moment before answering ."
"`` if it turns out that i am , then i will consider your proposal when you offer it , '' she said , determination in her voice and her expression ."
"kalil tightened his hold around her waist ."
"`` you will marry me , '' he said into her ear , his tone just as determined ."
"`` we 'll see ."
"what is your father like ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` strong , fair , '' he said with pride ."
"`` that 's what he 's like as a ruler but how was he as a father ? ''"
"she asked , ignoring the increased speed the horse seemed to move into ."
"`` the same , '' was all he said ."
"`` what was your father like ? ''"
"dani accepted that he did n't want to discuss his family life ."
"that was fine with her ."
"two could play at that game ."
"`` he was fair , '' she tossed back ."
"kalil laughed ."
"`` my father was usually busy ."
"i do n't remember him being around much until i was in my teen years ."
"at that point , he was very involved with me and taught me many things ."
"i used to sit in his office sometimes , just to listen to some of his meetings ."
"from the moment i was small , i wanted to be strong like my father , and i always hoped i could be as wise . ''"
"dani felt her heart swell with emotion as she thought about kalil as a small boy , hiding in the corner and watching his father with awe ."
"what an inspiring figure he must have presented ."
"if he was anything like kalil , she would imagine him to be a great ruler ."
"kalil seemed to inspire people ."
"she 'd only witnessed it in the palace staff , but she had the impression that he ruled through wisdom and not through fear ."
"since he 'd shared a bit of his past with her , she relented as well ."
"`` my mother would wake up on saturday mornings and leave my father in bed ."
"but she 'd send us all into his room to wake him up ."
"me and my sister would try and sneak into the room but we were giggling so much , there was no way he could possibly sleep through it all ."
"then we 'd jump onto the bed in the hopes of pinning him down and tickling him ."
"she and i would end up being pinned down ourselves and tickled unmercifully by him since he was only pretending to sleep after my mom left the room . ''"
"`` that sounds like a nice memory . ''"
"`` he was a lot of fun . ''"
"`` tell me some of the arabic you learned this morning , '' he demanded , turning the corner and halting the horse looking out to a canyon ."
"dani tried to turn around but his arm would n't let her move ."
"she had to stare out at the view , admiring the vision before her but also fuming that alea had told on her ."
"`` i asked alea not to mention that to you , '' she said ."
"`` one thing you 'll learn quickly , there 's really nothing that happens in the palace that i do n't know about , '' he explained ."
"`` so say something you 've learned ."
"i 'm glad you started learning our language ."
"it will make your transition here smoother . ''"
"`` let 's just change the subject , okay ? ''"
"`` tell me what you 've learned . ''"
"`` no . ''"
"`` okay , then i 'll just have to kiss this beautiful neck of yours , '' he said ."
"`` no ! ''"
"dani said , moving her neck out of his way ."
"but nothing was out of his reach if he really wanted it ."
"`` fine , kalil , i 'll tell you , '' she said , desperate to keep his lips off the sensitive spot on her neck ."
"she spoke the few phrases she remembered but knew she was slaughtering his language ."
"he replied back to her but she did n't understand what he said ."
"he repeated his words in english , `` i 'm proud of you . ''"
"dani shook her head ."
"`` i know that everyone else wants to impress you but perhaps i have an ulterior motive for learning the language and it has nothing to do with impressing you , '' she asked ."
"she ignored the silly glow that his words produced within her ."
"dani did n't want him to know that she was planning to escape because that would only increase the security around the palace and possibly herself ."
"but she did n't want him to think that she was accepting the situation or that she wanted him to be proud of her ."
"`` i would n't dream of assuming that you are trying to impress me ."
"that would mean you have feelings for me and we would n't want to think that , would we ? ''"
"he said , his hand flattening against her stomach ."
"dani gasped and tried to move his hand away ."
"`` kalil , what are you doing ? ''"
"the heat invading through her entire system ."
"`` i 'm proving to you that you have feelings for me , even if they are only sexual . ''"
"dani 's head rolled back onto his shoulder , gritting her teeth against the power he seemed to hold over her ."
"."
"`` should n't we get back to the palace ?"
"do n't you have work to do or a horse to take care of , war to start or something like that ? ''"
"`` i have all the time in the world right now , '' he replied ."
"but he turned the horse around and urged the horse to a trot ."
"they rode back to the palace in silence ."
"dani was considering murdering him for the feelings that were racing through her system ."
"she was too new at the sexual tension , never having experienced it before , to be able to endure it delivered from a master ."
"it took them only minutes to arrive back at the palace so dani assumed they had traveled in some sort of circle ."
"she knew she should have been paying attention to the landscape instead of her conversation , but she acknowledged that she had n't been nervous on top of the horse ."
"kalil definitely knew how to distract a person from their fears ."
"it was something she would have to remember for future confrontations with him ."
"as soon as they arrived , he tossed the reigns to a stable hand , then slid off the horse first ."
"when he reached up to help her off , her eyes were caught with the intensity of his ."
"she noted with trepidation that his were just as on fire as she felt ."
"`` i 'll see you tonight for dinner , '' was all he said before he walked quickly back through the stables towards the palace , leaving her standing there alone , staring at his retreating back and wondering what was going on in that mind of his ."
"kalil walked determinedly back through the halls of the palace ."
"he saw his top advisor waiting at the entrance but waved him off ."
"he could n't talk about business right at the moment ."
"without another word to anyone , he made his way to his quarters , stripping off his clothes as soon as the door was closed behind him ."
"he walked right into the shower , turning the jets to cold in an effort to get his body under control ."
"what had he been thinking ?"
"taking danielle out on a horse was just asking for punishment ."
"and then kissing her neck , touching her sweet , responsive body ."
"it had been pure torture !"
"he remembered that one night they 'd shared together and how he had kissed her , intending to leave her at the door ."
"something inside him had known she was innocent and that he was only asking for trouble ."
"but he 'd wanted just one kiss that night , hoping for an opportunity on another trip to london to sample more of the lovely danielle 's charms ."
"never in his wildest dreams had he imagined the kind of flames that would explode between the two of them with that one kiss ."
"he 'd tried to stop at the door , then again when he 'd laid her down on the bed ."
"but she 'd wanted him and he 'd never wanted another woman like he 'd wanted her ."
"there was just something electrifying about her soft , tentative touch that eliminated coherent thinking ."
"the discovery that she really was as innocent as he 'd suspected had only intensified the pleasure he 'd felt that night ."
"the idea that no other man had ever touched his danielle , and he knew he 'd started thinking about her as his after that first kiss , had made him feel powerful , strong and definitely caveman-like ."
"he 'd wanted to beat his chest and throw open the windows to stake his claim ."
"when the bracelet and shredded contractual documents had come back to him , kalil had been furious ."
"he 'd been so sure she 'd felt the same things he 'd felt ."
"how could she not ?"
"no woman had ever affected him like she had ."
"it had been his intention to buy her a house and convince her to become his mistress ."
"that 's why he 'd put security guards trailing her ."
"when the reports indicated that she may be pregnant , kalil had been ecstatic , and furious as well ."
"why had n't she contacted him ?"
"what was she thinking , not coming to let him know about their child at the first sign ?"
"the fact that she did n't really know who he was did n't occur to him until she 'd arrived on the plane , furiously putting him in his place , or at least where she thought he should be ."
"so he 'd taken matters into his own hands ."
"bringing her here had soothed his sense of frustration and had given him justification for bringing her along ."
"he knew she 'd balk at becoming his mistress no matter how prettily he 'd tied it up ."
"if she really was pregnant , he could then marry her to legitimize the children , then he 'd have months to show her how wonderful they could be together ."
"shutting off the jets , he hoped he was back in control of his libido ."
"it had never been a problem before ."
"so what was it about this tiny woman that drove him so hard to possess her ?"
"it certainly was n't her words of flattery since almost every word out of her mouth was insolence and would n't be tolerated in anyone else ."
"but it was such a gorgeous mouth , he thought , thinking of her luscious lips and bright smile ."
"sighing , he pulled on some clothes , not really caring what he was wearing or what was on his agenda for the rest of the day ."
"all he knew was that he 'd cleared his calendar so he could spend the evening with her ."
"and perhaps the night ?"
"he definitely hoped so , he thought with a smile as he walked into his office to greet the waiting diplomats ."
"chapter 8 dani held the towel around her , pulling the ends closer as she stared at the dress alea had laid out for dinner ."
"`` i ca n't wear that , '' dani said , swallowing hard ."
"`` you do n't like it ? ''"
"alea asked , the disappointment evident in her tone ."
"`` it 's beautiful , '' dani said honestly ."
"it was a shimmering gown of cream silk with spaghetti straps and a bias cut skirt ."
"it was barely more than what she would wear as a slip ."
"`` you do n't think his highness would approve ? ''"
"dani shook her head ."
"`` oh , i think 'his highness ' would definitely approve as long as we 're dining alone tonight . ''"
"`` that was the request . ''"
"dani 's eyes snapped to her ."
"`` kalil wants to dine alone tonight ? ''"
"dani did n't think she 'd be able to handle being along with him tonight ."
"there had already been two instances today when he 'd broken through her defenses with almost no effort at all ."
"wearing that shimmering dress that would cling to every curve of her body , revealing every reaction to his word or touch ."
"`` i definitely do n't think i can wear that , '' she said with more emphasis , swallowing hard just at the thought of an intimate scene with kalil , candlelight and soft music ."
"`` i think i 'll have to wear something else , '' she said definitively ."
"alea took the dress and disappeared back into the closet ."
"dani followed after her and her mouth dropped open at how full the room was becoming ."
"`` were more clothes delivered today ? ''"
"`` absolutely ."
"are n't they lovely ? ''"
"she asked , taking two other day outfits out ."
"one was a pantsuit in a soft blue with embroidery at the bottom of one and the other was a lovely shade of pink with a fitted jacket and white silk shirt ."
"there were others that were still in the bags and all of them still had the tags on them indicating that they were not borrowed from some other lover of kalil 's ."
"`` why are so many clothes coming ? ''"
"dani asked , wishing the expenses were n't piling up ."
"she was only going to escape and leave it all behind ."
"at least the tags were still on them so they could be returned once she was gone ."
"`` i think i 'll just wear my jeans and shirt ."
"that 's probably the safest route tonight . ''"
"`` but dinners are more formal at the palace . ''"
"dani was starting to become uncomfortable in the wet towel ."
"she glanced at the other dresses hanging in the closet and pointed to the one that looked safe enough ."
"`` how about that one ? ''"
"alea smiled broadly and pulled the black one out of the closet ."
"`` this is also lovely , '' she said and carried what dani could now see was a strapless , satin sheath ."
"now that she 'd finally made a choice , dani did n't feel like she could go back on the decision but she surveyed the other choices ."
"there were five other evening dresses , all of them just as lovely but still very sexy ."
"she wondered why her dresses were so revealing ."
"she would have thought that kalil would n't want his woman displayed in such a way ."
"pulling on the dress , she turned and looked at her reflection in the dressing room mirror , stunned by how the designer had created something that cinched in her waist , while at the same time , creating a silhouette that enhanced every feminine aspect of her figure ."
"and it was extremely comfortable ."
"stepping out of the dressing room , she reached behind her and tried to find the zipper ."
"`` alea , i 've changed my mind ."
"i do n't think i can wear something this ... . ''"
"she could n't think of an adjective before she heard kalil 's amused voice behind her ."
"`` alluring ? ''"
"he suggested ."
"dani spun around to face him and had to gasp at how handsome he looked ."
"he was dressed in dress slacks with a button down , white shirt open at the collar ."
"she could see a small amount of his chest and her mouth went dry , her fingers itched to touch his skin ."
"without her being aware of it , alea left the two of them alone ."
"`` you look lovely , '' he said softly , walking up to stand in front of her ."
"`` that dress makes you look very feminine . ''"
"dani finally broke eye contact with him and took a needed step back ."
"breathing in large gulps of air , she looked down at herself ."
"`` i do n't want you to get the wrong impression , '' she said ."
"`` what would be the wrong impression ? ''"
"`` that i 'm yours for the taking , '' she replied ."
"`` i would never assume that ."
"all i 'm hoping for is a nice , relaxing dinner with you ."
"is that too much ? ''"
"`` no , '' she replied , feeling silly ."
"`` good , '' he smiled and dani 's heart skipped a beat ."
"`` then let 's eat , '' he said and took her hand in his warm one to guide her out of her room to the patio outside her door ."
"she had n't realized it , but someone had set up dinner out on the wrought iron table ."
"it was now covered in white linen , candles and silver covered dishes ."
"kalil walked up to the table and seated her in one of the cushioned chairs ."
"`` would you like some wine ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` that would be nice , '' she said , needing anything to quench her thirst ."
"he poured her a delicious , crisp red wine , then poured another glass for himself ."
"`` to a peaceful night ? ''"
"he suggested , raising his glass towards hers ."
"`` perfect , '' she said and smiled tentatively towards him ."
"`` what 's the occasion ? ''"
"`` none really ."
"i 've just had a busy day and was looking forward to a relaxing dinner with you ."
"did you have other plans ? ''"
"`` you know i did n't , '' she said , glaring at him ."
"`` what on earth would i do besides try and convince you that this is all so unnecessary ? ''"
"`` perhaps learn more arabic ? ''"
"he suggested ."
"`` i did ask alea for some other phrases , '' she said ."
"`` what are they ? ''"
"dani repeated her colors which alea had taught her as they were choosing dresses earlier in the evening ."
"kalil laughed at her pronunciation but she could tell that he was impressed ."
"`` i 'll have a tutor come to the palace tomorrow ."
"perhaps that would help as well ."
"i 'm glad you like your assistant though . ''"
"`` she 's wonderful ."
"where did you find her ? ''"
"`` i have a great staff who continue to find other useful people to help run the country ."
"what would you do if you were queen ? ''"
"`` that 's an interesting question ."
"what would you suggest ?"
"i could just spend my day changing clothes and appearing at various places . ''"
"`` that 's one idea . ''"
"`` well , with all the clothes that keep appearing , i was wondering if that was the plan . ''"
"`` do you not like clothes ?"
"i thought all women loved to have new outfits . ''"
"`` i was n't much into fashion , '' he admitted ."
"`` i was actually the girl who wore jeans all the time in school and tried to keep up with the boys . ''"
"`` i 'm guessing that was in elementary school ."
"what about when you were in high school ? ''"
"`` well , by that time , i was more interested in school than boys ."
"and by the time i went to university , i guess i dated but there was n't anything serious ."
"mostly just friends . ''"
"`` why is that ? ''"
"he said once the servant left with the covers to their dishes ."
"`` why is what ? ''"
"she asked , distracted by the heavenly smell of the roasted salmon and rice pilaf ."
"there was also asparagus with a tangy lemon sauce and a lovely garnish that looked too lovely to even move from the side of the plate ."
"`` i just do n't understand how a woman as lovely as you could possibly be untouched at the age of twenty six . ''"
"dani raised one eyebrow ."
"`` as for that , no man really interested me enough to take the plunge into the scary world of sex . ''"
"`` until me , '' he clarified ."
"dani did n't like the smug look on his face ."
"`` i guess so , '' she said non-committally ."
"`` are you challenging me to prove that i interest you ? ''"
"he laughed ."
"`` not a good idea when you 're dressed in that outfit . ''"
"dani blushed and turned her attention to the salmon ."
"`` what were you like as a child ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` mean . ''"
"dani laughed instantly ."
"`` really ? ''"
"`` no ."
"i guess i was just curious about everything ."
"i loved science ."
"i once caused a fire in the laboratory in the east wing ."
"my father was pretty furious . ''"
"`` what did he do ? ''"
"he stopped and thought for a moment ."
"`` i believe i was n't allowed in the laboratory until i repaired the damage to the room ."
"i also had to write a paper on why the explosion happened . ''"
"`` you repaired the equipment ? ''"
"`` why is that so hard to believe ? ''"
"`` because you 're a prince ."
"i just ca n't see any person of royal descent stooping to manual labor . ''"
"`` my father had all of us do several kinds of jobs as we were growing up ."
"he said it was the only way we would understand what we 're asking of others ."
"my sisters even groomed their own horses for most of their years ."
"they loved it ."
"if it were up to their husbands , they would saddle their horses now . ''"
"`` i 'm not saying it is n't a worthy experience ."
"i just ca n't see you getting your hands dirty and calloused . ''"
"`` believe it ."
"i 've done it several times and they are the best experiences of my life ."
"our son will also do those things . ''"
"dani lowered her lashes at the mention of a child ."
"looking at him across the table , she could easily imagine having children with him ."
"but those thoughts led to the future and she knew there was n't one with this man ."
"`` where did you go to school ? ''"
"`` i went to oxford for my undergraduate degree and to harvard business school in america later on . ''"
"`` wow !"
"so you 're one of those really educated people ? ''"
"`` i 'm not sure i 'm more educated than anyone else . ''"
"dani rolled her eyes ."
"`` i do n't have a graduate degree nor did i go to either of the top schools in the world . ''"
"`` everything is relative ."
"i do n't think i would have the patience to teach small children like you do . ''"
"`` you 're used to people jumping at your orders immediately , correct ? ''"
"`` everyone jumps except for one small woman . ''"
"`` you mean me , correct ? ''"
"`` exactly . ''"
"`` what order would you have me follow ?"
"besides taking a pregnancy test . ''"
"`` i would simply order you into bed so i could make love to you all night , just as we did three weeks ago . ''"
"his simple words made dani 's mouth drop open ."
"she had assumed he 'd say something like share meals with him or help him with some sort of project ."
"she was n't used to a man wanting her sexually ."
"`` well , '' she said , clearing her throat ."
"`` that 's direct enough , i guess . ''"
"`` would you like me to beat around the bush more ? ''"
"dani shook her head then realized he probably could n't see her very well in the candlelight ."
"`` no ."
"direct is good ."
"at least i understand your perspective . ''"
"`` was there any doubt about my perspective ? ''"
"`` i was n't really sure if i was here simply as a potential baby carrier , '' she admitted ."
"`` never doubt that i want you ."
"i know the feelings are reciprocated ."
"i do n't understand why you are denying those feelings though . ''"
"`` i think we should change the subject , '' she said and stood up , taking the glass of water with her and ignoring the full glass of wine ."
"she walked off the patio , aware that he was following her but giving her the space she needed right at the moment ."
"`` what are your sisters like ? ''"
"she asked ."
"kalil followed her and they talked about their siblings , what it was like to grow up in the palace with servants versus living in a suburban neighborhood ."
"kalil was open about his life and many of his stories made her laugh ."
"he was a wonderful story teller ."
"what she did n't realize was that as they walked , they were moving deeper into the garden where the dim lights from the candles and the interior were moving farther off ."
"they were still within the walls of the palace so that may have lulled her into a false sense of security ."
"but suddenly dani looked around her and found she was surrounded by glowing blossoms ."
"`` where are we ? ''"
"she asked , amazed at the lovely blooms at her fingertips ."
"`` it is called a moonlight garden , '' he explained , pulling one large , white blossom off a bush ."
"`` the flowers are all white so they glow in the moonlight . ''"
"`` how lovely , '' she said , smiling as she took the offered flower ."
"`` i did n't know this was possible . ''"
"`` it probably is possible everywhere but has a greater impact here in the dryer temperatures ."
"the humidity of your english weather would n't be conducive to glowing in the moonlight ."
"you need strong moon beams to see the blossoms . ''"
"`` i suppose so , '' she said , turning to find herself in kalil 's arms ."
"`` we 're going to make love tonight , danielle , '' he said with absolute confidence ."
"`` i do n't think that would be a good idea , '' she said but heard the breathless quality of her voice ."
"`` why not ? ''"
"he asked , staring at her mouth as his hands rested lightly on her waist , drawing her closer to his tall , muscular body ."
"dani tried to think but he was just too handsome ."
"she put her hands on his chest in an effort to put more space between them ."
"but all she felt was muscles and heat ."
"instead of pushing him away , her fingers explored , almost against her will ."
"she was just too curious of his body ."
"`` we should go inside , '' he said , his voice rough as he felt her fingers run along his arms ."
"`` no , please ."
"just stay out here for a little while , '' she said , her mind spinning but aware enough that the bed was inside whereas there was n't a bed here in the moonlight ."
"as his hands slid up her waist , his mouth descended towards hers ."
"she tried to brace herself , wanting to taste him but not wanting to lose control once again ."
"she got only half her wish ."
"as his mouth covered hers , she whimpered with excitement as he pulled her closer , his hands unzipping the dress and sliding inside ."
"the double assault on her mouth and her skin made her shiver and press her body against his , needing to feel more ."
"the night air surrounded her as the dress dropped to the ground ."
"she stood against him in only black lace underwear and black heels ."
"she felt his fingers push the pins out of her hair and reached down to slide her fingers against the ridges of his stomach , moving around to his back and up , reveling in the feel of his muscles moving as she touched new parts of his body ."
"he tilted her head , his mouth moving down her neck , then suddenly she was lifted up and his mouth closed over her nipple ."
"dani could n't believe the heat that poured through her and her legs wrapped around his waist , her body moving against him as he pulled , nibbled and bit against her tender flesh ."
"`` i ca n't take much more , '' she cried out but her hands pressed his head against her breast , not letting him stop ."
"with a curse , kalil held her against him as he dropped to the ground ."
"within moments , he had positioned herself over him , torn off the lace barricade and unzipped his slacks ."
"`` dani ! ''"
"he growled out when he was finally inside her , holding her hips still as he savored the feeling of being inside her warmth once again ."
"`` do n't move , '' he said when he felt her wiggle slightly ."
"`` ca n't stop , '' she gasped when she moved only slightly against him ."
"`` please , kalil , '' she cried out ."
"`` help me . ''"
"that was the only thing that could move him at that moment ."
"looking up at her , noting that her eyes were closed and her body was writhing against him impossibly made him harder , driving himself deeper inside her ."
"he knew she felt it too when he heard her gasp of surprise ."
"with a groan , he pulled her hips up , then down once again , showing her how to move , watching her face to see what she liked the most ."
"and when she cried out her release , he was quick to follow , her cries pulling him along ."
"it was a long time later that dani looked around , her eyes coming open with great effort ."
"she noticed that they were still in the garden , laying on the soft grass and she shook her head ."
"`` what ? ''"
"he asked , his hands sifting through her hair , down her back and along her arms ."
"`` we 're in the garden , '' she said , resting her chin on the middle of his chest ."
"kalil looked around , not really surprised by their surroundings ."
"`` so we are . ''"
"she sighed and started to pull away ."
"`` i thought if we kissed out here in the garden , it would be safe and i could get away with only a taste . ''"
"he lifted her up , then followed ."
"`` you were incorrect in that assumption , obviously . ''"
"`` yes , i suppose so . ''"
"she started to bend down and pick up her clothes , but he stopped her ."
"`` and i 'm not done yet , '' he said as he spun her around and lifted her into his arms ."
"`` i want more of you ."
"and this time , we 're going to take it slow , '' he said as he carried her into the bedroom , laying her down on the silk sheets ."
"she started to say something , but he stopped her in the most expedient way ."
"he covered her mouth with his own , then followed with his body ."
"`` no arguments tonight , danielle , '' he said roughly ."
"at that moment , she could n't speak , much less argue with him ."
"so for this one time , she would n't deny his command ."
"chapter 9 dani rolled over and felt for kalil ."
"but her hands only found empty space ."
"since it was such an odd occurrence after the night they had shared , it woke her up fully ."
"`` good morning , '' alea said and dani was startled into sitting up ."
"thankfully , she grabbed the sheet in time to save herself additional embarrassment ."
"`` i 've brought your robe , '' she said in a sing-song voice ."
"`` and there is coffee on the terrace . ''"
"alea disappeared into the bathroom after depositing a beautiful , pink silk robe on the end of dani 's bed ."
"dani had just belted the robe around her waist when kalil walked into her room ."
"alea 's smile disappeared instantly and she slipped out of the room quickly ."
"dani looked across the room at the angry kalil and wished she too could disappear ."
"for some reason , kalil looked ready to commit murder ."
"`` is something on your mind ? ''"
"she asked , wondering where the sensitive , caring lover of the night before had disappeared to ."
"`` do you have something to tell me ? ''"
"he said and placed her calendar on the desk near the bed ."
"it took dani a moment to realize what he was holding but the realization came and she became angry ."
"`` are you snooping through my personal belongings ? ''"
"`` it was open on the desk last night ."
"i noticed it this morning and glanced at your calendar , wondering what i was keeping you from this week . ''"
"`` and ?"
"did you find anything interesting ? ''"
"she said and walked over to the desk to snatch her calendar away from his prying eyes ."
"`` i noticed that you have several lunches with friends scheduled ."
"which i am sincerely sorry you have to miss . ''"
"dani sighed and pushed her brown hair off her face and behind her shoulders ."
"`` kalil , i do n't understand why i have to miss them ."
"we had sex once , '' she started to say ."
"kalil 's eyes snapped to hers ."
"`` it was more than once that night , '' he said and his voice had lost some of the anger ."
"but his eyes were still intense as they looked down at her ."
"`` and you 've been keeping something from me ."
"when are you going to tell me ? ''"
"dani looked confused ."
"`` what are you talking about ? ''"
"she demanded and opened her calendar to the current month ."
"`` there 's nothing here but lunch appointments and my to do list which is n't very interesting since it is filled with simple crafts i was planning on doing over the summer . ''"
"`` i was n't looking at the crafts . ''"
"kalil snapped the page backwards one month ."
"`` i was noticing the check marks beside the first week in may , '' he said , pointing to the blue check marks on five days at the beginning of the month ."
"`` do those indicate what i think they mean ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"dani looked down at the dates on which she 'd marked her last period ."
"her face instantly turned red and she nodded her head , unable to look back up at him ."
"it was such an intimate subject she just could n't talk to him about her monthly cycles ."
"`` yes ."
"but what of it ? ''"
"she said ."
"then all the blood left her face ."
"she looked down at her calendar , then snapped the pages to the current month ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she gasped ."
"she counted the weeks again ."
"then a third time just to be sure ."
"`` it ca n't be ! ''"
"she said , her legs giving out on her as she fell onto the edge of the bed ."
"kalil looked at her and knew that she had n't been keeping the truth of her tardy period from him ."
"she was either the ultimate actress or she honestly had n't known ."
"he preferred to assume the latter since he did n't want to think she was able to lie so convincingly ."
"`` danielle , i think you had better see a doctor . ''"
"she looked up at his handsome face and shook her head ."
"`` it ca n't be ! ''"
"she said ."
"kalil wiped the errant tear that escaped from her eyes ."
"`` it can be , '' he countered ."
"`` but it was only one night . ''"
"`` it only takes one time . ''"
"`` no !"
"i have friends ."
"it is so hard for them to get pregnant ."
"it took carrie and tim over a year to get pregnant ."
"it just is n't possible ! ''"
"kalil sighed and shook his head ."
"`` danielle , it is not only possible , but probable that you are now more than six weeks pregnant ."
"if that is the case , we need to be married immediately . ''"
"dani was too overwhelmed by the idea that she was now two weeks late on her period ."
"for someone who was regular to the point of clockwork , that idea terrified her ."
"adding marriage to the equation only boggled her mind ."
"`` married ? ''"
"`` yes , that was what this whole exercise was about , if you 'll remember . ''"
"`` no !"
"it was to prove that i was n't pregnant . ''"
"`` and if you were , we needed to get married immediately so as to avoid any possible questions about the legitimacy of our child ."
"i do n't want anyone to denigrate our son . ''"
"dani wanted to say that it could be a daughter , but that might make this whole situation too real ."
"acknowledgement was not yet within her grasp yet ."
"`` and if you were n't pregnant before , i think there was a definite possibility that it occurred last night . ''"
"`` last night ?"
"that was never supposed to happen ! ''"
"kalil stood up and stepped back from her ."
"`` i know that is what you thought but you have to admit that what we share is incredible . ''"
"`` but for how long ?"
"this is n't fair ."
"you 've already said any marriage between us would have to be temporary . ''"
"`` unfortunately , that is true ."
"my people would never accept you ."
"we have very good relations with great britain but i will be expected to marry a woman of basir ."
"it will solidify my country . ''"
"`` and what of me ?"
"what will happen once you 've removed me from your life ? ''"
"`` do n't say things like that ."
"you can always be a part of our son 's life ."
"and afterwards , we can still be together . ''"
"`` while you 're married to another woman ? ''"
"i do n't think so ! ''"
"she said , stepping out of his arms ."
"`` what kind of a husband would that make you ?"
"and what would that make me ? ''"
"dani shook her head , pushing her hair out of her face and wondering how she was going to deal with all the emotions hitting her ."
"there was absolute joy that she was probably pregnant ."
"and definitely excitement at the idea of sharing this life with kalil ."
"but mixed with all that was the humiliation and anger that she was n't good enough for a man like kalil ."
"and he wanted her to become his mistress ?"
"did he really think she was that kind of a woman ?"
"`` it wo n't be like that , '' he assured her ."
"`` what would it be like ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"`` would i get certain days of the week and your wife will get others ?"
"will she work the charity circuit but i get all the state dinners ?"
"and what of our child ?"
"will she , '' dani said , emphasizing the use of the feminine pronoun , `` be assured of ruling the country as the first born and if so , will she be able to have much respect for men since her father would n't ' even acknowledge her mother ? ''"
"`` i think you 're becoming too emotional ."
"why do n't you rest for a little while and we 'll continue this conversation later ? ''"
"he suggested but since he was moving towards the doors , his whole demeanor emanating his anger at her words , there was no question as to whether it was a suggestion or an order ."
"`` we 'll talk later . ''"
"dani glared at the closed door ."
"`` do n't count on it , '' she said out loud ."
"chapter 10 dani waited , listening to the silence ."
"finally , there was no noise ."
"it was time ."
"she threw the covers off the bed then smoothed them over the extra pillows to make it look like she was still sleeping ."
"it was a childish trick but she hoped it would hold off the search for a little while longer ."
"she squinted at her watch in the dim light from the moon and worried that she would n't make it ."
"she had to ."
"her whole future was at stake here ."
"and that of her unborn child 's ."
"she put a hand on her stomach and wondered for the hundredth time if she was doing the right thing ."
"it was kalil 's baby as well as hers ."
"biting her lip , she pushed those thoughts aside ."
"she would get back to london , find a lawyer and figure out what her options were ."
"she did n't want to stay here and become kalil 's temporary wife ."
"that road led to him gaining more legal rights and she would lose her child ."
"already , she 'd been swallowed up in the palace , not really understanding what her role was or how she could live in this kind of limbo ."
"opening the french door that led to the patio , she carefully closed it behind her , carrying her small bag of supplies on her shoulder ."
"she was leaving only with what she 'd brought with her ."
"she wore her jeans and tee shirt , wishing she had a sweater as well when the night air from the desert touched her skin ."
"it was cool , but surely it would n't kill her ."
"the water in her large bag jiggled and she considered leaving it behind since it was weighing her down , but she decided against it ."
"she suspected that it was only a few miles ' walk to the city but just the idea of walking through the dessert might make her thirsty enough to regret leaving it behind ."
"there were crackers and small loaves of bread she 'd filched from her breakfast and lunch so she felt like she had enough supplies to last her for the next few hours , enough time to get her to the city and reach the british embassy ."
"walking carefully through the gardens , she kept to the bushes in an effort to hide from any eyes she might not know about ."
"there were also cameras , but alea had assured her that none were on the inside of this small courtyard ."
"they were all over the palace though but she 'd found most of them during her walks today and hoped she could avoid detection ."
"glancing at her watch again , she knew she 'd have to speed up in order to meet the delivery trucks ."
"she 'd noticed them yesterday morning and , although they would n't get her out of the palace since they were searched by security , she was praying they would act as a distraction and allow her to be able to slip outside ."
"the trucks did n't head back into the city anyway ."
"they obviously moved on to their next route which was not in the direction she wanted to go ."
"it seemed like hours but was probably only five minutes before she reached the cement wall that enclosed the courtyard ."
"carefully stepping on the thick branches of an old , sturdy tree , she pulled herself over the barrier ."
"once she was on the top , she looked around , feeling as if she would be caught at any moment ."
"but when nothing happened , she slung her leg over the side and looked around ."
"she was in another courtyard , this one just as beautifully landscaped as the one she 'd just left ."
"from what she remembered this afternoon as she 'd stared out over the palace from a high window , there were two other courtyards she 'd have to make her way through before she reached the kitchens ."
"dani quickened her pace , hearing her breathing in the darkness as panic started to settle in ."
"it also seemed as if the night were getting darker and colder ."
"how could this be in the desert ?"
"she knew it got cold but this was really chilly ."
"glancing up , she saw that the moon was still as bright in the sky as it had been a few minutes ago ."
"maybe it was just her imagination ."
"she pushed herself through the next courtyard and pulled herself over the last wall , dropping softly onto the grass on the other side ."
"this was the kitchen area ."
"it was relatively quiet at this time of the night with only a few people moving about ."
"but no one seemed to notice her as she crouched along the white wall ."
"keeping to the shadows , she made her way to the nearest truck and waited , counting the number of people working and trying to figure out who was doing what ."
"feeling like a prisoner trying to escape , which she basically was , she made her way through to the back of a truck ."
"climbing inside , she sat down to catch her breath ."
"suddenly , the truck started moving ."
"dani peered out the back of the truck and saw that the kitchens were receding quickly ."
"she was leaving the palace ?"
"this had been too easy !"
"dani sat back and chewed nervously on her lip ."
"were n't they going to search the truck as it left ?"
"they had yesterday , but maybe it 's different for the early morning deliveries ?"
"maybe that was the case , she thought hopefully ."
"she 'd only watched the trucks that had come and gone during the day but maybe there was a different process for nighttime trucks ."
"the security was set up to keep people from coming in , after all ."
"it was n't to keep people from going out ."
"everyone was free to come and go as they pleased , except for her , of course ."
"she heard the voice of what she assumed was the driver as the truck slowed down ."
"she had no idea what they were saying or who the man was talking to but she prayed that nothing was suspected ."
"but why would anyone suspect anything ?"
"kalil had ignored her for the whole day ."
"he had n't even shown up for dinner as alea had informed her was his plan ."
"she 'd later found out that he 'd been delayed but had ignored his summons to his office later in the evening ."
"dani was n't sure if alea had relayed the response to his message but neither did she care ."
"now as she stared out at the night through the flap in the truck 's empty cargo area , she wondered if she could really be so lucky as to get away this quickly ."
"it was probably about one o'clock in the morning by now ."
"she had been expecting to have to work her way through the gates over the next few hours ."
"sure enough , the truck bounced over the security area of the outer gate moments later ."
"dani could barely suppress her excitement as the palace quickly faded into the night sky ."
"the lights were still bright but she could see that they were driving away and that was the important thing ."
"unfortunately , they were driving in the wrong direction ."
"dani had known that she could n't ride away in a truck and now she had to figure out how to get out of the truck ."
"the city lights were also fading away as the truck drove in the opposite direction she needed to go , just as she 'd suspected ."
"but there was no way she would give up now that she 'd gotten this far ."
"dani could n't believe her luck when the truck slowed down to what she guessed was some sort of stop sign ."
"quickly climbing over the back gate of the truck , her feet hit the sandy pavement just as the truck started moving again ."
"dani watched with excitement as the truck moved out of range , leaving her encased in the darkness of the desert ."
"dani looked around , feeling slightly disoriented ."
"where was the palace ?"
"there was only a moment of panic when she turned full circle and realized that the palace lights were no longer visible ."
"how on earth could an entire palace disappear so quickly ?"
"she assumed they had just driven over a sand dune and she simply had to walk back in the direction the truck had come from ."
"it would only be moments before she saw the palace lights with the city right behind it ."
"dani started off , following the slight tracks in the sand the truck had left ."
"but after fifteen minutes of walking , she still had n't found the lights ."
"where was she ?"
"what had happened ?"
"had she become so disoriented when she 'd walked away from the truck ?"
"turning back the way she 'd come , she walked another fifteen minutes in the opposite direction ."
"but still no lights ."
"and the ground underneath her was becoming softer ."
"had she left the street somehow ?"
"dani turned back , looking for some sort of landmark in the moonlight ."
"there were several rocks sticking up out of the sand like earthly statues guarding the moon 's domain ."
"but each of them looked similar , none having a specific shape that would allow her to gauge her position ."
"taking a deep breath and reminding herself that panic would n't help her situation , she continued walking , constantly searching the horizon for something that would indicate that she was heading in the right direction ."
"or even the pavement under her feet that would let her know she was back on the street ."
"glancing at her watch , she realized that over an hour had passed since she 'd left the truck ."
"dani looked around but there was n't anything new to see ."
"all her eyes took in was the moonlight hitting the sand or the various rock formations ."
"nothing that would indicate she was near any form of civilization ."
"this was crazy , she told herself ."
"she could n't be more than a mile or two from the palace or the city ."
"the truck had only been driving for a few minutes when she got out and she 'd seen the palace only a moment before she 'd pulled herself out of the truck ."
"the pack containing the water and food was biting into her shoulder so she shifted it around so it was less of a burden on her shoulders ."
"perhaps it was the sound of the water that caught her attention or maybe it was the complete lack of any other sound for so long , but dani suddenly heard a whisper ."
"it frightened her more than anything else had so far ."
"the sound came from her left and she stared out into the darkness , trying to see through the shadows cast by the moon ."
"was it an animal ?"
"were animals this close to the palace and the city ?"
"but how close was she ?"
"the sound almost became drown out by the sound of her beating heart as the fear raced along her nerves ."
"what on earth could be making that sort of crying sound ?"
"it was almost as if there was a child out there crying ."
"when that thought struck her , she became nervous but for a whole other reason ."
"a child stuck out here would be terrified ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"dani called out in the general direction she 'd heard the sound ."
"but as soon as she spoke the sound stopped ."
"`` is someone out there ? ''"
"she called out ."
"then realized she was speaking in english ."
"thinking back to the phrases alea had taught her over the past two days , dani called out in arabic , `` hello ? ''"
"again ."
"`` i do n't speak arabic very well , '' she said , hoping the words were correct and her point would come across even through her awful accent ."
"dani was relieved to hear a small laugh coming from the shadows of a large rock formation ."
"she moved closer and was startled when a little boy around seven or eight years old rushed out to the moonlight , a look on his face that showed his relief and desperation ."
"he started talking quickly in arabic , taking dani 's hand in hers and pulling her closer to the rock ."
"dani had no idea what the little boy was saying but she allowed herself to be led over to the rock ."
"there , crouched down low and shivering was a little girl of about five years old staring up at dani from the shadows ."
"her terrified eyes stared up and she reached out to her brother 's hand , pulling him down to her as if he were her only lifeline ."
"`` hello ! ''"
"dani said again and smiled broadly , showing the little girl that she was n't a threat ."
"`` are you thirsty ? ''"
"she said in english simply because she did n't know the words in arabic ."
"dani pulled out one of her bottles of water and offered it to the little girl ."
"she looked up to her brother who nodded quickly ."
"as soon as she had permission , the girl reached for the water and drank thirstily ."
"dani realized that the two children might have been out in the dessert for a while ."
"reaching into her bag , she brought out the other bottle of water and the crackers , offering the water to the boy and the crackers to the girl ."
"both children were quiet for a long time as they drank and ate in sequence , both seeming desperate to get the water and food inside their bellies as fast as possible ."
"when they were finally somewhat satisfied , her supplies were down by half ."
"dani ignored the sense of panic she felt at the realization that she did n't know where she was , sunrise was only a few hours away and she might not have enough water or food for the next day but also had two more people to help out ."
"`` are you cold ? ''"
"dani asked , taking out the blanket she 'd been trying to carry back to england for carrie ."
"`` here you go , '' she said and tucked the blanket around both children ."
"she then sat down next to them ."
"immediately , the girl climbed up onto dani 's lap and the boy curled up next to her , one hand on his sister 's back as if he had to reassure himself that she was still okay ."
"within moments , the two small children were fast asleep , sure in the knowledge that everything would be okay now that an adult was here to take care of them ."
"dani was n't so sure ."
"she stared up at the sky , noting how the moon had fallen towards the horizon but the stars were still bright in the sky ."
"it was almost dawn ."
"what would she do then ?"
"what would happen to them ?"
"maybe when the sun came up , she would be able to see farther ."
"surely the city was n't so far away ."
"it was possible that the rocks had obscured her view ."
"chapter 11 dani woke up suddenly , startled by the sound ."
"she had no idea what it was but knew that it did n't sound friendly ."
"she sat still , her arms wrapping around the two small bodies still curled up on her lap ."
"somehow , the boy had climbed onto her lap as well and both brother and sister were curled up , their arms wrapped around each other and dani while their bodies were covered by the baby blanket ."
"it was dirty now and she noted that the children were also covered in a layer of dust ."
"there were tears that had dried on their cheeks , leaving obvious marks after the tears accumulated more dust than their cheeks and dani 's heart broke thinking about how scared they must have been , lost in the desert without food or water for who knew how long ."
"the sound grew louder and it sounded like a jeep coming up but the voices were angry , yelling at each other as they moved across the desert ."
"the children must have understood that something was changing because they woke up and looked around ."
"dani knew the exact moment that they sensed her fear because they both looked up at her , their brown eyes wide and worried as they looked to her for reassurance ."
"dani smiled down at them and put a hand on their heads , fluffing their curly hair ."
"`` wait here , '' she said and gently slid both children to the side , making sure they were well hidden from view by the rocks ."
"she stood up and peered around the jagged rocks , but as soon as her head rose above the rocks , she was spotted ."
"dani gasped , her breath catching in her throat as about a dozen men started shouting , their machine guns pointed in the air and they all rushed over to where she was standing ."
"dani crouched down , covering the two small children with her body in an effort to protect them ."
"the two children climbed into her arms , clinging to her as they cried , fear making them slightly hysterical ."
"one man was calling on a radio and dani did n't know what was happening ."
"none were speaking in english and all were talking too fast for her to understand anything they said ."
"`` please , '' she said , hoping one of them would understand `` do n't hurt them , '' she called out ."
"`` they are scared ! ''"
"she yelled as one of the men gestured towards them and said something quickly into the phone ."
"a few minutes later , three black suvs pulled up ."
"dani had no idea what was happening now but somehow these were more sinister than the jeeps or men with machine guns ."
"the children were sobbing now and dani turned her back on the suvs , bending down to comfort the children and show them her smiling face ."
"she knew it was a little brittle because she was terrified herself ."
"but the fact that she appeared to not be scared calmed down the children again ."
"but then one of them pointed over dani 's shoulders and quieted down immediately ."
"dani glanced back , wondering what she could have seen that would scare her to silence ."
"and then she saw him herself ."
"kalil was getting out of the back of the suv , sunglasses covering his eyes but she could see the anger in every part of his body ."
"he walked over to her and looked down into her face , a muscle twitching on the side of his cheek ."
"`` have a nice evening ? ''"
"he asked ."
"dani was still holding the children 's hand , trying to comfort them as much as possible but one of the guards picked up the little girl abruptly ."
"the girl screamed and dani grabbed her back , instantly soothing her and glaring at the guard who had dared to try and take her ."
"dani shielded the little girl from the man but then had to pull the boy back when he tried to attack the guard ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she cried out , pulling him behind her and shaking her head ."
"`` if you will bring your charges with me , we can reunite them with their parents , '' kalil said , the voice of calm amidst the chaos ."
"`` really ? ''"
"dani asked , her voice cracking with emotion as she tried to hold both children at the same time ."
"the boy was valiantly trying to hold back tears as he protected his sister , but still afraid of the guards ."
"`` of course ."
"we are not so uncivilized here to hold children from their parents ."
"as it is , their parents are worried sick about the fate of their children and there are several other search parties out there trying to find them ."
"if you 'll follow me to the truck , we can quickly travel to the city and hand them over to be taken care of . ''"
"`` oh !"
"thank you ! ''"
"she said and bent down so she was at eye level with the children ."
"`` it is okay , '' she said as calmly as possible ."
"the children both stopped crying and looked at her , smearing their faces with the dust and tears ."
"they looked fearfully back at kalil and then back to dani who nodded ."
"`` okay ? ''"
"she said and took their small hands in hers ."
"`` let 's go , '' she said and led them over to the nearest suv ."
"a guard immediately opened the door for them and they climbed into the dark vehicle ."
"the children were instantly awed by the interior but neither would move even an inch away from dani who continued to keep her arms around each of them ."
"kalil got into the front seat and the driver immediately drove off ."
"dani was shocked at how long it took to reach the city ."
"she realized how lucky they were to have been rescued because it was at least a fifteen minute drive before she even saw the city on the horizon ."
"how could she have walked so far ?"
"and where had these two small children come from ?"
"as soon as they pulled up outside a suburban looking house , a woman rushed out of the front door , her arms outstretched and tears streaming down her face ."
"the children 's smiles grew broader as they wriggled out of the car and straight into their mother 's arms ."
"the three of them held each other for a long time , the father standing in the back ground trying to be strong and assertive in kalil 's presence but finally he too broke down and wrapped his arms around his family , the emotions causing his body to shake violently as he came to the understanding that his family was safe ."
"a long time later , the man stood up and wiped his face ."
"he wanted to keep one hand on his children , but he forced himself to come over to dani ."
"he took her hands in his and kissed them , bowing to her low and saying something in arabic quickly ."
"`` what is he saying ? ''"
"dani asked kalil , trying to ignore the body guards that were completely surrounding the perimeter of the house and yard in their effort to protect kalil ."
"kalil walked over and translated ."
"`` he is saying thank you for finding and saving his children , guaranteeing that he will be more careful in the future to protect his family ."
"he is also wishing that you find the same kind of happiness . ''"
"`` that 's nice , '' dani said , and smiled gratefully to the man ."
"he then turned to kalil and bowed low , just as he had to dani but with much more reverence ."
"the words seemed to pour out of his mouth and he kissed kalil 's hand ."
"kalil said something sternly to the man who nodded the whole time , bowing at then end in acknowledgement ."
"he then walked back to his family and herded them into the house ."
"`` let 's go , '' kalil said and put a hand to the small of dani 's back to hand her back into the suv ."
"without another word , he got into the car beside her ."
"dani knew he was furious and she knew he had every right ."
"she had tried to run away , take his unborn child with her and what he perceived to be an attempt to deny him any rights to his legacy ."
"`` kalil ... '' dani started only to be silenced with a sharp wave of his hand ."
"`` later , '' he snapped ."
"thirty minutes later , dani was being escorted through the palace , kalil right on her heels ."
"when she tried to turn towards the suite she had recently occupied , kalil stopped her and turned her in another direction ."
"`` you 've shown you ca n't be trusted . ''"
"his cryptic words hurt but she acknowledged that they were true ."
"she kept silent until they were in a new suite ."
"this one was bigger and seemed to have many rooms ."
"the first one opened up into a large , sunken living room complete with fireplace on one wall and a fountain outside the patio ."
"it was the epitome of luxury and dani wondered who lived here ."
"`` you 're things will be moved to here and i will ensure that you are still available when our wedding day arrives , '' kalil snapped but continued walking until he disappeared through a door ."
"dani did n't know what was expected of her so she just stood in the middle of the room , looking around ."
"`` do n't just stand there ."
"you need to get out of those awful clothes and into something more appropriate ."
"we are meeting the press in a few minutes . ''"
"she heard his voice but did n't see him ."
"dani looked down at her clothes and wondered what she was supposed to put on ."
"then his words hit her ."
"`` the press ? ''"
"she almost whispered ."
"kalil stepped out of the room which she understood was a bathroom now that he was only wearing a towel wrapped around his waist and dani 's thoughts flew out of her head ."
"he was glorious , she thought as he toweled his hair ."
"her mouth remembered the taste of his skin and her fingers itched to touch the light hair that covered his chest ."
"`` are you going to embarrass me again by wearing that to a press conference ? ''"
"he snapped ."
"dani raised her chin , challenging him with her eyes ."
"`` since i have no idea what you 're talking about , then yes ."
"i suppose i am going to embarrass you . ''"
"kalil walked quickly to her so he was towering above her ."
"`` do you understand that you have basically committed treason ?"
"i could have you jailed for the rest of your life ."
"you could give birth to our child in prison and never see him for your entire life . ''"
"dani swallowed hard ."
"`` what ?"
"why ? ''"
"`` you dared to steal the future ruler of basir ."
"i could consider that kidnapping and have you imprisoned . ''"
"`` but that 's not fair ! ''"
"she cried ."
"`` you kidnapped me and have kept me here against my will for the past several weeks and when i finally escape and hope to find some sort of legal recourse , you accuse me of treason ! ''"
"his eyes did n't soften in any way when she defended herself ."
"`` i do n't think you 'd be able to convince any judge of that when i get witnesses who would testify that you 've slept in my arms every night for the past week ."
"and were willing , i might add ."
"nor would a judge listen to the claims of kidnapping when you have been draped in clothes and jewels and pampered with every luxury . ''"
"`` but not of my choice ! ''"
"she spat out and moved away from him , tired of him trying to intimidate her ."
"well , it was n't really trying ."
"she was scared out of her mind ."
"she might have slept with the man , was about to bear his child and had talked with him through each meal ."
"but that did n't mean she knew him or understood what went through his mind ."
"`` prove it , '' he said and walked back to the bathroom ."
"`` but while you 're coming up with your defense , keep in mind that i will be the judge . ''"
"`` what ? ''"
"dani gasped ."
"he had reached the door to the bathroom by then and turned to offer her a mocking smile ."
"`` did it slip your mind that i am the crown prince ?"
"my word is law ."
"do n't try to escape again , danielle , '' he said softly ."
"then closed the door to the bathroom ."
"dani stood there feeling as if someone had punched her in the stomach ."
"could he really do that ?"
"did he have that much power ?"
"she suspected that he did ."
"good grief , the man controlled an army ."
"how in the world did she think she could evade his reach ?"
"he was one of the wealthiest men in the world who ruled one of the most powerful oil producing countries ."
"what chance did she have ?"
"alea appeared in the doorway to another room ."
"the woman was obviously nervous and had been crying if her red , puffy eyes were any indication ."
"`` would you like to shower ? ''"
"she asked softly ."
"dani looked down at her dust covered arms and clothing and nodded ."
"`` yes ."
"i think that is probably the first order of business , '' she said ."
"the warm water soothed her sore muscles she had n't realized were so tight ."
"she supposed that walking throughout the whole evening and sleeping against a jagged rock with two small children was n't conducive to a good night 's sleep ."
"she wished she could stay under the warm spray forever but she remembered that kalil had mentioned something about a press conference ."
"she had no idea what the press conference was about nor why she had to get dressed for it but she turned off the water and pulled on a large , fluffy bathrobe ."
"alea motioned for dani to follow her through another door and was led to a large bedroom ."
"dani 's feet sank into the wonderfully thick carpet as she followed alea to a huge dressing room ."
"all of the clothes that had been hanging in her previous room were now hanging in this one ."
"dani looked back and noted the masculine colors and heavier furniture ."
"`` alea , who 's room is this ? ''"
"she asked suspiciously ."
"before alea could answer , kalil appeared in the doorway dressed in a dark suit with a maroon , silk tied , the white collar of his shirt accenting the darkness of his skin and the intensity of his eyes as they looked over her figure ."
"`` it is mine , '' he said ."
"`` leave , '' was the only word he directed towards alea who instantly disappeared ."
"`` you 'll be staying here with me until our wedding as i mentioned ."
"i will be keeping an eye on you as will my personal guard . ''"
"dani 's mouth dropped open in shock ."
"`` here ?"
"i 'll be sharing a room with you ? ''"
"`` of course ."
"is n't that what i just explained ? ''"
"`` but why ?"
"i thought this would be a marriage of convenience ."
"why would you want me in your room ? ''"
"she asked desperately , pulling the sash tighter around her waist ."
"kalil walked forward and pulled her closer ."
"`` because of this , '' he said and kissed her ."
"it was hard and possessive , the strength pushed her head back against his arm that was around her back ."
"despite the brusqueness , her body responded ."
"there was no denying him ."
"her body was just too needy of whatever touch he gave out ."
"`` you 're mine , danielle !"
"do n't forget it , '' he said , glaring into her upturned face ."
"then his arms dropped and he stepped away ."
"`` wear the lavender suit , '' he said , then turned on his heel and walked away ."
"dani took the lavender suit off the hangar and put it on with shaking fingers ."
"it was a wonderful color with her dark hair but she did n't want to admit that he was right ."
"she hated him , she decided ."
"she would n't let him have this much power over her !"
"it was n't right for one person to be so powerful ."
"then why did her body wish that he would finish what he 'd just started ?"
"alea brushed her hair and pulled it into a smart twist in the back , pinning it up carefully ."
"dani did n't understand what all the fuss was about but was too depressed to argue ."
"`` ready ? ''"
"kalil asked when dani stood up and rounded the bed ."
"`` i suppose , but you have n't told me what this is all about . ''"
"she smoothed her skirt down her hips with nervous hands ."
"`` it is about our engagement , of course , '' he said and turned to leave , letting her stand there in anger ."
"dani walked out of the room and caught up with him just as he was opening the door to the rest of the palace ."
"they were both instantly surrounded by guards as they walked down the hallway ."
"one of them moved ahead and opened a door where there were muted sounds coming out ."
"dani fell back a step but kalil was right behind her , putting an arm around her shoulders to guide her inside ."
"the entire conference was in arabic but kalil kept her by his side the entire time ."
"dani was terrified as the cameras flashed and popped ."
"questions seemed to be directed at her but each time she looked up , kalil answered for her ."
"several times , the audience of reporters erupted into laughter and dani looked up at kalil to determine if it was something he 'd said ."
"but she only saw a mildly amused expression on his face ."
"it was as if he had become someone else as soon as he 'd stepped out in front of the cameras ."
"she remembered that it had been that way when they 'd been at the family 's house earlier in the day ."
"kalil had become more distant and harder ."
"she supposed he had to project a certain aura of strength and vitality to the people ."
"any weakness in him would be construed as a weakness in basir ."
"despite her anger at his authoritarian ways , her respect for him grew as she watched him control the press , what she suspected was answering only the questions he deemed appropriate if the suppressed frustration on some reporters faces was any indication , and still charmed the entire room ."
"after about a half hour , kalil called an end to the conference ."
"he immediately put an arm around her waist and guided her out ."
"one reporter called out to her and she was astonished when she heard her name ."
"dani looked back , only to be blinded by the lights and cameras flashing in her eyes ."
"if it were n't for kalil 's strong arm around her , she would have fallen on her face and made a complete fool of herself ."
"but what was new ?"
"had n't this whole day been a comedy of errors ?"
"she was just tired , she told herself ."
"she 'd had maybe two hours of sleep last night and it had n't been quality sleep ."
"besides the stress of the whole day had worn on her so she was leaning against his side as they made their way out of the press room ."
"kalil stopped once they were out and turned her to face him ."
"he noted the dark circles under her eyes and tilted her chin up so he could see her better ."
"`` thank you for saving those children by the way ."
"their parents will forever be in your debt . ''"
"`` i did n't really do anything , '' she said , smothering a yawn ."
"`` why do n't you head back to my room and get some sleep ."
"we 'll talk over dinner . ''"
"dani nodded , unable to do anything else ."
"now that the cameras were not flashing and the reporters calling out questions she could n't decipher , her exhaustion was really coming through ."
"as soon as the doors closed behind her , dani pulled off the suit , laying it carefully on the end of the bed ."
"she pulled back the covers to the extremely large bed and just curled up in her underwear ."
"she did n't even have the strength to put on something more comfortable ."
"a long time later , she sat up in bed , wondering what she 'd heard ."
"there had been a noise but it was completely dark inside the room ."
"it took her a long time to figure out where she was and what had happened , but then the memory of the long night and equally long day came back to her ."
"dani listened again and heard the voices ."
"it was kalil and someone she did n't know ."
"but that was n't unusual since she did n't know anyone else other than alea ."
"that thought brought about her loneliness and she fell back against the pillows , feeling sorry for herself ."
"what was she going to do ?"
"how was she going to get out of this mess ?"
"dani sighed and pushed back the covers ."
"instead of pulling on the lavender suit again , she found the fluffy robe she 'd worn after her shower ."
"padding barefoot out of the bedroom , dani opened the door to find the living room filled with bulky men in dark suits ."
"all eyes turned to look at her at the first noise ."
"`` go get dressed , '' kalil snapped and dani instantly stepped back into the bedroom ."
"leaning against the door , she found the light switch and fumed ."
"`` how dare he talk to me like that ! ''"
"she thought ."
"but then looked down at her robe and sighed ."
"`` maybe he is right , '' she thought ."
"`` and why am i talking to myself ? ''"
"she wondered ."
"`` because there 's no one else to talk to , that 's why , '' she said out loud as she walked through the room to the closet containing what she knew now to be her wardrobe ."
"pulling on the first thing she found , she pinned the green sundress up the front of her , not even caring how the cut of the dress showed off her slender waist and hugged her figure , making her appear delicate and dainty ."
"before opening the door again , she pulled all the pins out of her hair and brushed , refusing to be primped and pinned when she was alone ."
"she did n't mind having to present an image when reporters were around but she was used to walking around her apartment in her pajamas and slippers if she wanted to ."
"so if kalil did n't want her revealed to the world , then he 'd better not conduct business where she was sleeping ."
"all the wind was knocked out of her argument when she opened the door and found only kalil standing by the fireplace that was going full force , flames licking the top and disappearing up the chimney ."
"`` is this better ? ''"
"she asked , not stopping the hostility that surfaced in her voice ."
"`` perfect , '' he said and his eyes caught hers , the amusement apparent ."
"`` what 's so funny ? '"
"she demanded , stomping over to where he was standing ."
"she crossed her arms over her stomach and tapped her foot , revealing her impatience ."
"`` you look lovely when you 're angry , danielle ."
"i never thought that was an accurate statement but you 're eyes get brighter and your cheeks become rosy ."
"you 're a little spitfire although i should be admonishing you for showing me your anger . ''"
"`` showing you ... '' dani could n't get the words out through her fury ."
"`` i 'll show you my anger whenever you make me angry , '' she spat back at him ."
"`` i would caution you against that , '' he said and stepped closer to her ."
"`` we still have not resolved what is to be your punishment for trying to escape from me last night . ''"
"`` you 're not going to punish me , '' she said forcefully ."
"`` i was doing what any other person would do under the circumstances ."
"how would you feel if you were trapped in my apartment back in london ? ''"
"`` but you are n't trapped ."
"you are free to move about the entire palace . ''"
"`` right ! ''"
"she snapped , not believing him ."
"`` try it , '' he said ."
"`` but do so tomorrow ."
"for tonight , we dine and we talk , ' he said , handing her a glass filled with bubbly liquid ."
"dani looked at the glass and then thought of her baby ."
"she hesitated a moment , wondering if it was safe to drink champagne when she was pregnant ."
"she did n't want to bring it up to kalil , thinking he would consider her silly for such a small amount ."
"but she 'd heard that the first few months were the most crucial for development ."
"`` it is ginger ale , '' he said , his eyes twinkling with his amusement ."
"the relief came quickly ."
"`` are you also drinking ginger ale ? ''"
"she asked hopefully ."
"`` no , '' he replied ."
"dani 's smile faded ."
"`` oh ."
"i can see we 're genuinely sharing this experience . ''"
"`` what do you mean ?"
"i 'll be here for you and you 'll have the best doctors . ''"
"`` that 's wonderful ."
"meanwhile , i 'm making all the sacrifices . ''"
"`` what sort of sacrifice are you making ? ''"
"`` i ca n't drink wine or caffeine and who knows what else ."
"i ca n't do everything i used to do , '' dani tried to keep the tears from her eyes but she knew that he could tell she was close to tears ."
"`` i 've been forced to give up my whole future simply because ... '' she hesitated then turned away ."
"`` oh , never mind ."
"you would n't understand . ''"
"`` i do n't understand simply because you have n't told me ."
"if you want me to understand , then continue with what you were saying . ''"
"`` no ."
"it is pointless . ''"
"dani had been about to say that she 'd given up everything for one incredible night of sex but that would reveal too much ."
"she could also say that she 'd fallen in love with a man who could n't possibly love her and it more than she dreamed it could ."
"`` do n't worry about me ."
"i 'll be the good wife for however long you deem it necessary ."
"then you can go marry your lovely lina who , '' dani stopped and shook her head again , `` and i 'll be the woman who gets to visit her child whenever there is time . ''"
"she was n't going to bring up the fact that lina was in love with his brother ."
"let them wallow in their own misery just as she was doomed to do for the rest of her life ."
"`` these are just hormones talking , danielle ."
"and let 's not discuss the future ."
"it will take care of itself ."
"why ca n't we just enjoy the experience of waiting for our child to come into this world ? ''"
"dani sniffed ."
"if she was going to leave this relationship with any dignity at all , she 'd have to learn to get over her feelings for kalil ."
"and now was as good a time as any to start ."
"`` so , let 's go on as we mean to continue ."
"how is the champagne ? ''"
"she asked , picking up her glass of ginger ale and taking a sip ."
"the cold liquid felt good as it moved down her throat ."
"`` if it would make you feel better , then i will not drink the champagne . ''"
"without a second word , he set the glass down on the coffee table and moved over to the french doors ."
"`` are you ready to eat dinner ?"
"you must be starving . ''"
"dani realized that she was hungry ."
"she 'd had only bread this morning and nothing since ."
"`` yes , thank you . ''"
"they moved over to the patio ."
"the dinner was tense and dani was actually relieved when a servant arrived with a message which meant that kalil had to attend to an urgent matter ."
"the following morning , dani woke up feeling miserable ."
"rushing into the bathroom was her first priority and she barely made it before her stomach emptied itself into the toilet ."
"she felt a gentle hand pull her hair back from her face and a moment later , a cool wash cloth was handed to her ."
"`` thank you alea , '' she said , assuming it was her assistant who was always on hand as soon as she woke up ."
"`` alea is not here yet ."
"i sent her to the kitchen to get some tea for you . ''"
"the idea of tea , or anything only made her stomach lurch again ."
"`` nothing ."
"please , do n't let her bring anything , '' she said , sitting down on the cool tiles ."
"even speaking was too much work so she just lay there , hoping she would die quickly ."
"when kalil 's strong arms lifted her up , dani wanted to protest , but she was feeling too miserable to even speak and the tears moved quickly down her cheeks ."
"he laid her on the bed , then disappeared to get another cool cloth ."
"he wiped her forehead and neck which felt wonderful ."
"unfortunately , dani could n't tell him that so she simply closed her eyes and prayed that he would get the message ."
"when he started to stand up , she grabbed his hand ."
"her eyes snapped open and she pleaded , `` do n't leave ."
"do n't stop ."
"please , '' she begged ."
"she was feeling miserable and knew that he probably had a thousand things to deal with right now but she felt too awful to let him go right now ."
"`` i 'm sorry , you probably need to work , do n't you ? ''"
"she said and released his hand ."
"`` i have a few more minutes before my next meeting , '' he said and continued stroking her with the cool cloth ."
"eventually , dani must have drifted to sleep because she woke up several hours later feeling wonderful ."
"dani sat up in bed tentatively and looked around ."
"the drapes were drawn together to keep the bright sunshine out so the bedroom was in mostly darkness ."
"dani stepped out from under the covers and smiled to herself ."
"`` wow ! ''"
"she said to the darkness ."
"`` what a difference . ''"
"there was a soft knock on the door and dani called out to come in ."
"alea appeared , nervously looked through the dim light ."
"`` how are you feeling ? ''"
"she asked softly ."
"`` great , '' dani said and stood up ."
"`` i 'm not sure what happened this morning but i feel fine now ."
"it must have been something i ate last night . ''"
"alea laughed softly ."
"`` or perhaps it is our future king making his presence known ? ''"
"dani 's eyes widened and she chuckled at her lack of astuteness ."
"`` well , yes ."
"i guess it could be ."
"what a little tyrant , '' she said ."
"`` he will have to be in order to follow in his father 's footsteps . ''"
"`` it could be a girl , you know . ''"
"`` nonsense , '' kalil 's deep voice said from the doorway ."
"`` our son is strong and demanding . ''"
"dani did n't feel like arguing with him so she simply laughed and nodded her head ."
"`` i 'm sure you know what you 're talking about . ''"
"turning to alea , she inquired , `` is there any breakfast left ?"
"i 'm really starving , '' she said ."
"`` you may have anything you 'd like ."
"i 'll have the kitchens send in some fresh fruit and juice . ''"
"`` that sounds heavenly ."
"i 'll get into the shower , '' she said and shyly stepped into the large bathroom , aware of kalil 's eyes watching her the whole time ."
"over breakfast , which was actually lunch for kalil since it was one o'clock in the afternoon , he explained that she was to see the royal obstetrician this afternoon ."
"`` we 'll make sure our son is healthy and developing . ''"
"dani only smiled and ate more strawberries , uncaring of the agenda as long as she could eat strawberries for the rest of the day ."
"`` that 's fine . ''"
"`` and i 've arranged for a secretary for you ."
"she will start after your doctor 's meeting but you can work out a schedule with her later . ''"
"she was grateful to him but also not wanting to take any favors from him ."
"`` thank you , '' was all she said , slicing another strawberry to eat ."
"`` is there anything else you 'd like ? ''"
"dani thought about it for a long moment ."
"could she say it ?"
"would he understand ?"
"she decided to risk it ."
"otherwise , she 'd spend her whole brief marriage to him bored out of her mind ."
"`` a purpose ? ''"
"he did n't say anything to her immediately ."
"`` i 'll assume that would be something other than taking care of our son ? ''"
"dani smiled and ate another strawberry ."
"`` i 'm relatively sure i can be pregnant and still do something else . ''"
"`` our wedding is in three days ."
"perhaps you could work with the wedding coordinator to explain your preferences ? ''"
"`` wedding ? ''"
"she said , a strawberry suspended halfway to her mouth ."
"`` yes ."
"it must happen ."
"i realize that this conversation precipitated your ill-conceived exit from the palace two days ago , but we must be married ."
"i will not have any aspersions on my son 's legitimacy . ''"
"`` ah ."
"yes ."
"we must consider our son 's future . ''"
"she emphasized the 'our ' part of her statement ."
"she 'd been afraid it would irritate him but he only smiled slightly ."
"`` how about if we consider this discussion after the honeymoon ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` honeymoon ? ''"
"she gasped ."
"`` is that really necessary ? ''"
"she did n't want to be alone with kalil for an extended amount of time ."
"`` do n't you have to run basir and attend important meetings ?"
"run an army or something ? ''"
"kalil chuckled ."
"`` are you afraid of being alone with me , danielle ?"
"why would that be ? ''"
"he asked , his voice silky and husky ."
"his eyes wandered over her features , dropping below her neck to her breasts which were already reacting to the idea of a honeymoon ."
"she 'd been without him for two nights and already her body was craving him with a desperate need that was heating her body ."
"`` i 'm not afraid of being alone with you , '' she lied , her chin going up a notch ."
"`` i 'm just wondering at the utility of the time away from your duties . ''"
"his smile deepened and she suspected that he could see right through her bravado and read her mind ."
"`` that 's very sensitive of you but i can assure you that i can take some time away ."
"jasim will be able to cover everything while i 'm gone ."
"he 's a very competent man . ''"
"dani sighed and pushed her plate of fruit away ."
"her appetite was no longer intense and she needed some time to think and figure out what her next move was ."
"`` if you 're finished , are you ready to see the doctor ? ''"
"`` i thought my appointment was n't until this afternoon . ''"
"kalil shook his head ."
"`` you need to start thinking like a princess , danielle ."
"being a member of the royal family means that people make an appointment to see you ."
"not the other way around ."
"the obstetrician is waiting your convenience . ''"
"`` good grief !"
"the doctor is waiting ?"
"why did n't you say something ?"
"i would n't have kept him waiting . ''"
"kalil grabbed her hand as she rushed past him ."
"`` danielle , what did i just tell you ? ''"
"dani tried to slow down but it just was n't in her to keep someone waiting for any reason ."
"`` fine ."
"i 'm ready ."
"can we go now ? ''"
"kalil wiped his perfectly clean mouth and stood up , placing his napkin on the table behind him ."
"`` i did n't think you were so eager to see the doctor ."
"why this sudden change ? ''"
"dani smiled broadly ."
"`` you mistake me ."
"initially , i did n't believe i was pregnant and all of this was unnecessary and would mess up my life and my future ."
"now i know i 'm pregnant and my life and my future are irrevocably changed ."
"but i 've always wanted to have children . ''"
"kalil gently touched her cheek ."
"`` i 'm glad something is to your liking then . ''"
"dani looked up at him , his gentle touch affecting her deeply ."
"`` have i been such a chore ? ''"
"kalil laughed ."
"`` you ask me that after yesterday 's fiasco ? ''"
"`` well , forget that ."
"that was desperation ."
"but before . ''"
"`` no , danielle ."
"you were not a chore . ''"
"he looked at her as if he really meant it ."
"danielle decided to accept him at his word this time ."
"`` what is the doctor 's name ? ''"
"`` isiri , '' kalil replied ."
"`` he is an old family friend and a wonderful doctor ."
"he 's delivered all of my sisters ' children as well . ''"
"dani instantly liked the kind gentleman who quickly made her feel comfortable both about his credentials and his knowledge ."
"she felt odd being examined by a family friend , but at least kalil left the room so that indignity was avoided ."
"but as soon as he used an instrument to hear the baby 's heart , dani demanded that he come right back into the examining room ."
"`` listen , '' she said when he walked in , his eyes worried and looking for the source of dani 's new tears ."
"dani nodded to the doctor who placed the doppler microphone close to her womb again and there was the faint beating of the heart ."
"`` is n't it wonderful ? ''"
"she asked , one tear slipping off her lashes ."
"she could tell that kalil was affected too ."
"he was gripping her hand and swallowing tightly ."
"the moment passed and kalil stepped back , the stern face of the strong ruler firmly in place ."
"if dani had n't been feeling the same emotion , she might have missed it cross his face ."
"at the door to the examining room , kalil immediately excused himself and walked purposefully down the hallway towards what she now knew were the palace offices ."
"the doctor excused himself and dani dressed once again , feeling alone and sad now that kalil had left ."
"dani sighed and looked around , wondering what she was supposed to do now ."
"that decision was quickly taken away from her as jalla arrived ."
"`` good morning ! ''"
"she called out , linking her arm with dani 's ."
"`` was that not the most exciting moment of your life so far ? ''"
"she asked ."
"dani swallowed hard , remembering how wonderful it had been ."
"`` yes ."
"it was . ''"
"dani looked at the woman strangely ."
"`` but i do n't understand why you are so happy with this situation , '' she finally said , voicing the issue that had been on her mind for so long ."
"`` it should be you giving birth the basir 's future king with kalil ."
"i 'm sorry that it is n't you , '' dani said sincerely ."
"jalla waved dani 's concerns aside ."
"`` do n't worry about that ."
"i think you will be a wonderful mother to basir 's future king ."
"i could n't do better . ''"
"dani 's suspicions were growing ."
"`` jalla , '' she said , stopping the lovely woman in the middle of the hallway and looking around to make sure she was n't going to be overheard , `` when are you going to admit that you 're not in love with kalil ? ''"
"she asked ."
"jalla laughed ."
"`` of course i 'm not in love with him ."
"nor is he in love with me ."
"that is the way with arranged marriages ."
"but you love him , '' she whispered , `` and that is something that should thrive . ''"
"`` because you 're in love with jasim ? ''"
"jalla 's eyes clouded over and she looked around , worried that someone else had heard ."
"she pulled dani into the nearest doorway which turned out to be a solarium filled with tropical plants ."
"jalla fingered one of the delicate blooms as she tried to figure out how to proceed ."
"`` how did you know ? ''"
"`` i did n't until this moment ."
"i had suspicions . ''"
"`` what kind of suspicions ? ''"
"she asked , glancing at dani with worried eyes ."
"`` the way you look at jasim when you think no one else is looking ."
"there was also your extreme look of relief when kalil told you that your wedding would have to be put off for another year . ''"
"`` ah , well , i guess i need to be a little more circumspect , should n't i ? ''"
"she asked , her eyes clouding up ."
"`` i was just hoping that ... well , you know , that maybe you and kalil would fall in love and be happy together . ''"
"dani nodded sadly ."
"`` yes , that is a nice fantasy but i do n't think it will happen . ''"
"`` why ?"
"half of the fantasy is already a reality , is n't it ? ''"
"jalla asked softly , looking at dani with more wisdom than her twenty-one years would assume ."
"dani smiled but there was no happiness there ."
"`` yes , i 'm in love with him but that is only half of the equation ."
"besides , apparently , i 'm not good enough to become queen ."
"the people of basir wo n't accept me , '' she explained , unable to maintain eye contact so her eyes slid away and looked at the tall trees that were forming a canopy over the lower level flowers ."
"`` that 's nonsense , '' jalla scoffed ."
"`` perhaps the people might have been skeptical before but after the rescue , well , it has been all over the news ."
"the people love you . ''"
"dani 's eye snapped back to jalla 's ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` the people are in love with you ."
"the news reports have been all about how you rescued the small children and saved them from death in the desert ."
"the press conference kalil held yesterday was an announcement that he was to marry you and everyone has embraced you . ''"
"dani 's heart soared for a moment , but then kalil 's comments of the morning were brought back to her ."
"he was still furious with her and did n't trust her ."
"there could be no love without trust ."
"`` that is nice , but i do n't want to live in a fantasy land ."
"the marriage will be set aside in one year ."
"that will give kalil enough time to ensure that our son , or daughter , is legitimately claimed by the people of basir . ''"
"`` that is nonsense , '' jalla said and stood up ."
"she took dani 's hands as well and pulled her forward ."
"`` you must have hope that things will work out ."
"we will no longer think about this and will let the future take care of itself , '' she said ."
"dani looked at the younger woman with startled eyes ."
"`` those are almost the exact same words kalil said this morning , '' she explained ."
"jalla was delighted ."
"`` you see ?"
"i know that man better than you so you must trust me on this ."
"and now , we must make your wedding day something to be remembered by everyone ."
"there will be two weddings ."
"one will be held in your london with your friends and family and the next will be held here in basir so the people can celebrate and show you their support . ''"
"`` i 'm sorry , jalla ."
"did you say there will be two weddings ? ''"
"dani asked , sure she had misunderstood ."
"`` of course ."
"kalil said you probably would n't feel married unless you had a church wedding ."
"we will be flying to london tomorrow ."
"the arrangements have already been made ."
"your college friends and sisters are flying in and your friend carrie , i believe is her name , will be your maid of honor , '' she explained as they walked arm in arm down the hallway towards the room where the dress designer had set up shop for the past few days as she prepared all of the dresses ."
"dani was overwhelmed with the idea that kalil was going to give her a church wedding ."
"how could he have known how much that would mean to her ?"
"it was such a small gesture on his part and one he could have just ignored ."
"but he was right ."
"she would n't feel married unless she had a church wedding with her family and friends around ."
"she had always dreamed of being married in a small , stone church with her father walking her down the aisle and her mother smiling as she said her vows ."
"a lump formed in her throat as she thought about the extra effort kalil was going through just for her ."
"why would he do something like that ?"
"the man was such a mystery and she wished she had the time to figure him out ."
"she wished she could have the next fifty years with him ."
"but since that was an impossible dream , she had to help herself survive the next twelve months ."
"putting on a facade , she described her ideal wedding dress to the designer , whose name was pattia ."
"pattia drew while listening to dani ."
"when she was finished , pattia turned the sketch pad around and dani gasped ."
"`` that 's it !"
"that 's exactly what i always pictured getting married in , '' she said ."
"pattia smiled and nodded her head ."
"`` we measure now , '' she said in her broken english , then we will all work to create this dress . ''"
"pattia turned to jalla ."
"`` and what for the basiri wedding ? ''"
"she asked ."
"jalla described a dress with lots of color and jewels , even a headpiece which would have trinkets on it ."
"dani showed no preference since she did n't understand what the celebration would entail ."
"she left all those details up to jalla who happily described what dani hoped would be kalil 's ideal dress ."
"next came the measurements ."
"two separate assistants poked and prodded , measured and wrote down notes on dani 's petite frame ."
"by the end of the long session , dani did n't know what some of the numbers were about but she trusted pattia and her assistants to know what they were doing ."
"`` you come back tomorrow morning and we see what we need to finish , '' she said ."
"`` i 'll be here , '' she promised ."
"`` now , we work on your language skills , '' jalla said and led the way down the hallway to a smaller sitting room ."
"a woman was there and instantly rose to her feet as soon as jalla and dani entered ."
"`` good morning , '' the woman said in arabic ."
"dani understood that much but everything else the two women said was a mystery ."
"jalla left dani and the other woman , who was named isis and closed the doors behind her ."
"isis explained that it would be her job to teach her as much arabic as possible before the wedding and would continue the lessons once dani and kalil returned from their honeymoon ."
"they spent the rest of the afternoon working and dani was amazed at how much the woman was able to teach her in such a short amount of time ."
"the sun was starting to set when kalil entered the room ."
"dani rose and bowed slightly , saying `` good evening , your highness , '' when he entered ."
"dani saw isis leave quickly after bowing herself to kalil but she only had eyes for kalil ."
"she desperately wanted to thank him for the thoughtful surprise of her own wedding but the emotions kept her from saying anything ."
"`` i hope you have had a nice day , '' he said , wary with her show of respect that had never occurred before ."
"`` other than this morning , it has been fine , '' was all she could say , looking down at the floor shyly ."
"a sudden whoosh of desire hit her and it seemed to be even more intense than ever before ."
"`` we have a dinner tonight with several members of my cabinet , '' he said , walking over to her , standing so close she could feel the heat from his body ."
"`` do you think you 'll be able to attend ?"
"i do n't want you to do anything that might overtax you . ''"
"`` i 'll be fine , '' she said and heard the breathless quality of her voice ."
"`` thank you for the wedding , '' she finally said ."
"`` jalla told me how you have arranged for my family and friends to see me in a church wedding . ''"
"`` will this make you happy ? ''"
"he asked , his eyes inscrutable ."
"`` very , '' she replied , wishing he would touch her ."
"`` then i 'm glad you 're happy . ''"
"she laughed suddenly , aware of how awkward their conversation had become ."
"`` why are we talking like this ?"
"should n't i be yelling at your or stomping my feet ?"
"or some other equally annoying and dramatic act that will show you how immature i am ? ''"
"kalil smiled ."
"`` i think you are very mature ."
"i understand you 've been put into a difficult situation ."
"it has n't been the most relaxing few weeks for you , has it ? ''"
"`` it has definitely been something of a whirlwind , '' she agreed ."
"`` come , we must get ready for the evening ahead ."
"as we walk , i 'll tell you about the people you 'll meet . ''"
"they walked down the hallway towards their suite of rooms and kalil told her funny stories about various people ."
"by the time they 'd reached their room , she was laughing so hard at his stories she had to hold her sides and wipe the tears from her eyes ."
"the evening was wonderfully easy compared to what she was expecting when he first mentioned it ."
"because of his stories , dani was n't as intimidated as she might have been earlier ."
"they were members of his cabinet , high ranking officials that ranged in age between fifty and eighty ."
"all of them bowed when he entered and showed him a great deal of respect ."
"it was impressive how kalil handled each of them , no matter if they brought up a controversial subject or a funny story to relate ."
"kalil sharply admonished one man who dared to criticize another of his cabinet ."
"apparently , kalil did n't accept backstabbing comments or power-mongering ."
"each member and their wives were like a part of his family ."
"although the evening was interesting , by the time the last of the cabinet members bowed out of the room , dani was exhausted ."
"the pregnancy seemed to be coming in full force now and the fatigue she 'd always heard about was kicking in ."
"it was as if it were a powerful force that would n't be denied ."
"kalil led her back to their suite of rooms and closed the door ."
"`` you were wonderful tonight , '' he said , taking off his tie and placing it on the dresser ."
"his jacket came next and he was watching her the whole time ."
"dani lay down on the bed and yawned , her body aching it was so tired ."
"`` thank you , '' she mumbled ."
"she wished he 'd done this striptease earlier in the evening but right now , all she could do was get off her feet ."
"`` i 'm just going to lay down for a moment before getting ready for bed , '' she said ."
"within moments , she was sound asleep ."
"kalil watched as her eyes fluttered shut and her body relaxed in sleep ."
"it was as if a light switch had turned off and she was instantly out ."
"he considered calling her assistant to get her undressed ."
"he 'd wanted her painfully all evening but had kept his hands to himself , sensing something different in her ."
"her looks were more inquisitive and he was n't getting the same overtly sexual questions in her eyes that he 'd received before she 'd tried to leave him ."
"kalil gritted his teeth at the memory of that night and how terrified he 'd been of losing her ."
"there had been several hours in which he 'd felt as if his body was going to explode into a thousand pieces of frustration if he did n't find her immediately ."
"it was only his many years of controlling his emotions that allowed him to remain in control and ensure her safe recovery ."
"that control was tested again tonight as he pulled off her shoes , then stockings and clothes ."
"the temptation was strong to slowly kiss her awake and pull her into his arms ."
"he was sure he could do it , could make her want him ."
"but he did n't want that anymore ."
"he wanted her to come to him , want him on a deeper level than just sexual ."
"kalil was stunned when he realized that he wanted her heart and not just her body ."
"but deep down , he 'd been fighting that need since he met her ."
"no other woman had gotten beneath his skin like she had ."
"right from the start , she 'd broken down his barriers ."
"he 'd never had sex without contraception and he 'd never relied on the woman to take care of that matter , although he assumed that almost all of them were practicing some other form of contraception themselves ."
"but that first night ... he smiled as he remembered the ache that had formed in his gut as he 'd taken her into his arms and initiated her into the delights of the sexual world ."
"and it had only gotten better he thought to himself as he pulled the covers over her sleeping form ."
"she rolled over and curled up , one arm reaching out to the blanket where he was supposed to be ."
"the action made him smile ."
"in her sleep , she wanted him for more than just what he could make her body feel ."
"that was something ."
"not much but a start ."
"she 'd done so much over the past few days ."
"his people would accept her now as their future queen ."
"in fact , they would be angry with him if he let her slip away ."
"the expectation was high after the rescue that he would marry her after it was known that she was a personal guest at the palace ."
"and now , after the press conference when he 'd announced his plans , the press had been thrilled ."
"they had been reporting on her background , interviewing anyone they could find that would tell them what an exceptional person she was ."
"kalil had n't needed the digging to know that ."
"he 'd known it instinctively from the start ."
"and she 'd only proven it over and over again ."
"if he was honest with himself , he even admired her for trying to get back to england ."
"he chuckled at her attempt though ."
"she should have known that he 'd never allow it ."
"and even if she 'd gotten back by some odd miracle , he was n't being vain by saying that he had the power to have the british government hand her over to him on a silver platter if he asked ."
"which he would have ."
"there would have been no questions asked ."
"he sat down on the side of the bed and twirled a reddish brown lock of hair between his fingers ."
"he had contracts he needed to review and documents to approve ."
"instead , he pulled off the rest of his clothes and got into bed , pulling her sleeping form against his naked body ."
"she moved automatically into his arms without hesitation and kalil closed his eyes and fell asleep , contemplating making love to her in a few hours ."
"chapter 12 `` oh please !"
"not again , '' dani said , praying the world would remain steady and kept her eyes closed ."
"the nausea was just as intense as the morning before and she gritted her teeth as the bed moved beneath kalil 's body as he got out and headed towards the shower ."
"she heard the water start and swallowed gently , praying that she would make it through the morning ."
"dani had no idea what time it was ."
"she wanted to peek through her eye lids and see if it was even morning but she did n't dare , not trusting her stomach to remain calm enough to handle it ."
"fifteen minutes later , kalil came out of the bathroom with only a towel around his lean hips ."
"dani opened her eyes a fraction and saw his stomach muscles and the desire pulsed through her despite her misery ."
"oh , dear , she thought to herself ."
"if he can make me feel that strongly even when i 'm this miserable , i 'm really in trouble ."
"kalil dressed quietly and then left the room , kissing her softly on the cheek before exiting ."
"dani kept her eyes closed and did n't move ."
"she was equally grateful that he did n't touch the bed which would have caused it to move and therefore her stomach as well ."
"she fell asleep once there was silence again but an hour later , she was in the bathroom , throwing up again , wishing she could call out for kalil and have him help her again this morning ."
"but she was alone this time , not even alea was around to help her since it was barely six o'clock in the morning ."
"once there was nothing left in her stomach , she crawled back to bed and laid there , her eyes closed and one hand resting on her stomach ."
"eventually , the nausea eased and she was able to sit up slightly and look around ."
"by then , the sun was up and alea poked her head into the room ."
"`` good , you 're awake , '' she said ."
"`` barely , '' dani replied ."
"`` are you ready for your morning coffee ? ''"
"she asked , bringing in a tray ."
"just the smell of food made her stomach roll over ."
"`` no !"
"please take it away . ''"
"alea quickly disappeared , coming back empty handed this time but still with a bright smile ."
"`` i was wondering if that might be the case ."
"many new mothers experience this kind of feeling . ''"
"`` have you ? ''"
"dani asked ."
"`` yes ."
"my first was miserable and the second time i got pregnant , i could n't enjoy the lack of morning sickness because i was so afraid it would come . ''"
"she laughed at her memory but dani did n't see the humor at the moment ."
"`` how many children do you have ? ''"
"dani asked , shocked that she 'd been so overwhelmed by her own problems she had n't even taken the time to get to know alea who had been so helpful over the past few weeks ."
"`` just two , '' she said and started picking up the clothes on the chair ."
"dani had n't realized that she was basically naked until alea picked up the dress she 'd been wearing at the dinner last night ."
"she blushed as she glanced down at her bra and underwear ."
"but the movement made her sick so she accepted that she did n't care about kalil undressing her ."
"`` what 's on the agenda today ? ''"
"dani asked ."
"`` you have arabic lessons right after breakfast , a fitting , then more lessons , another fitting , lessons and then i believe his highness has scheduled in a nap this afternoon ."
"tonight , there is a dinner for several ambassadors and i 'm to dress you up for that , '' she smiled ."
"dani groaned ."
"`` so all day i 'm either learning arabic or being poked for my wedding . ''"
"`` you fly back to london tomorrow so the dress must be finished by tonight ."
"i know that they have been working on it non-stop all night ."
"there are shifts of seamstresses working on both dresses ."
"when i checked this morning , it looked absolutely lovely ."
"his highness will be thrilled with the results , '' she said , sighing as she thought about the weddings to happen over the next two days ."
"`` i 'll take your word on it , '' she said and pushed her legs over the side of the bed ."
"`` can you get me a robe ? ''"
"she asked ."
"alea instantly held one out to her and dani slipped her arms inside ."
"`` there is one other item on the agenda for today , '' alea mentioned , biting her lip and turning to the side ."
"dani knew she was n't going to like it if alea did n't even want to mention it to her ."
"`` what is it ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` the king has asked for an interview with you today . ''"
"`` the king ? ''"
"dani asked , not sure what that entailed ."
"`` you mean kalil 's father ? ''"
"she gasped ."
"for some reason , the thought of speaking to kalil 's father was more intimidating than talking to a king ."
"one was only a figurehead that really could n't ' do her any harm that she would really care about ."
"the other was the father of the man she loved with all her heart and could do more harm than she cared to think about ."
"what if he did n't like her ?"
"what if kalil 's father told her she could n't ' marry kalil , baby or not ."
"what if he made her leave the country immediately never to see kalil again ?"
"`` stop worrying , '' a deep voice said from the doorway ."
"kalil stood there , looking cool and suave as he watched the expressions flit across her face ."
"`` my father is a wonderful , fair man and he would n't dream of hurting your feelings . ''"
"dani 's eyes took in his form greedily ."
"`` how long have you been standing there ? ''"
"`` long enough to know that you 're worrying about something . ''"
"`` i 'm supposed to have a meeting with your father today , '' she said , biting her lower lip and looking at her reflection in the mirror ."
"`` do you think i should change into something else ?"
"maybe the white suit ? ''"
"she asked ."
"kalil walked up to stand in front of her so she could n't see her reflection ."
"`` it sounds like you might care what my father thinks of you ."
"should i take that as a good sign ? ''"
"he joked ."
"dani turned around , unwilling to let him know how much she really cared ."
"`` no ."
"this is a silly conversation and thank you for putting things back into perspective for me ."
"i forgot that i 'm already judged and found lacking so i 'll just be on my silly way , '' she said and stormed out of the room ."
"`` danielle ! ''"
"he called after her but dani did n't stop walking ."
"`` danielle stop right there , '' he said from the doorway of the bedroom ."
"`` who found you lacking ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"dani had continued walking carefully across the room ."
"her hand rested on the door to their suite when she finally stopped and turned back to face him ."
"`` you did , '' she said quietly and blinked as she glanced back at him ."
"with that parting comment , she walked out of the living room and quietly closed the door on his shocked expression ."
"kalil could barely move and he continued to stare at the closed door , shocked that she did n't understand what he 'd been trying to tell her all along ."
"did she really think that he found her lacking ?"
"did n't she understand everything he 'd done to get the people of basir to accept her as their future queen ?"
"obviously not ."
"she must still be under the impression that this was only a temporary marriage for the sake of their baby ."
"he knew he 'd said that earlier , before he accepted how important she was to his life ."
"he would have to disabuse her quickly of that thinking because there was no way he was ever going to let her go ."
"dani made her way carefully down the hallway towards the fitting room ."
"she understood that she only had one day until their wedding and was n't expecting much in regards to her dress ."
"she expected only a simplified version of what she 'd seen on the drawing yesterday ."
"but when she walked in , her upset stomach was the last thing on her mind as she took in the glorious dress that was hanging from a hangar in the middle of the room ."
"the white silk bodice was covered with jewels that looked real as they glittered in the sunshine ."
"the dress was yards and yards of white chiffon with jewels twinkling as they hid in the folds ."
"the cut was simple and elegant but the way it glittered took dani 's breath away ."
"`` oh my ! ''"
"she said , still standing in the doorway ."
"an exhausted looking pattia appeared from behind ."
"`` do you like it ? ''"
"she asked hopefully ."
"`` i love it , pattia !"
"you are an artist . ''"
"`` and what about this one ? ''"
"she asked , turning dani 's attention to the other wedding dress ."
"it was a turquoise silk dress that also came to the floor but every edge was trimmed in gold braid and shimmered with gold sequins that danced in the sunlight ."
"dani smiled and nodded ."
"`` it 's incredibly lovely as well , '' she answered ."
"pattia sighed in relief ."
"`` i 'm so glad ."
"we just need to hem both and they are ready , '' she explained ."
"`` as are the other dresses that were created yesterday although not for the actual wedding but for the festivities after the ceremony on saturday ."
"`` come , you must try on the dresses quickly so we can make the final touches , '' she said and waved dani into an enclosed area ."
"two assistants helped dani into the dress and veil and she saw herself in the mirror and was in love with the dress ."
"`` oh pattia , it even feels comfortable !"
"i thought wedding dresses were supposed to be awfully uncomfortable . ''"
"`` not on my watch , '' pattia said ."
"`` i 've lined the dress with satin and some softer material to protect your skin ."
"the blue dress is made almost entirely of silk so it will feel wonderful without the extra fabric ."
"do n't worry about that . ''"
"dani stood for only twenty minutes while the seamstresses pinned and tucked the dress around her waist , shoulders and adjusted the length ."
"then the white dress was taken off and the blue one put on with the same attention to detail ."
"the blue one was much more fun and jalla entered just as she was standing up on the pedestal for the seamstresses to adjust the length ."
"`` you do n't know anything about our wedding ceremony , do you ? ''"
"jalla asked , her face lighting up at the sight of dani in the sparkling blue dress ."
"`` no , is it very different from ours ? ''"
"`` oh yes !"
"it lasts for five days in most cases and there is much dancing and singing and so much food you wo n't want to even see food for your entire honeymoon . ''"
"jalla continued to describe how the bride and groom walk together through the circle of guests and face each other , saying their vows in the presence of the priest and their family ."
"the actual ceremony is very brief , lasting only about five minutes ."
"the groom makes promises , the bride makes promises and the priest blesses the union ."
"afterwards , the groom escorts the bride around the room where she collects flowers from the guests as a sign of fertility and hope in the future , then the couple leads the guests to the banquet ."
"although the bride and groom are only present for the first feast , the guests stay for additional days of celebrating where they set up the home for the bride and groom to return to ."
"`` but is that necessary in our case ? ''"
"dani asked , thinking the whole ceremony sounded lovely and very quaint ."
"`` does n't kalil have everything he needs ? ''"
"`` well , in the case of kalil , he 'll give out the gifts instead of receiving them ."
"each guest will also have gifts for you from the various countries that are represented ."
"the marriage of a royal prince of basir is a very special event and the whole country is getting ready to celebrate ."
"instead of only the guests , there are special events scheduled for all over the city and in many of the villages . ''"
"`` what kinds of gifts will kalil give out ? ''"
"dani asked , stepping out of the blue dress and immediately stepping into a yellow dress that flowed around her ankles and hugged her bodice ."
"if she was feeling better , she would have spun around to watch the delicate material float around her legs ."
"`` oh , the bride is never told what the gifts are ."
"it is a special event ."
"it is considered bad luck for the bride to know before the celebration . ''"
"`` interesting , '' dani said and waited while the seamstresses fitted her with the latest gown ."
"there were ten in all ranging in colors from every part of the rainbow ."
"there were tailored suits with skirts or pants , flowing dresses for the evening and pattia even pulled out stunning evening gowns ."
"`` how many people will be at the ceremony ? ''"
"`` i believe there are less than twenty at your london ceremony , '' jalla said , and dani breathed a sigh of relief ."
"but her next words made dani have to sit down ."
"`` and i think a little over a thousand for the basiri wedding ceremony , '' she said , smothering a smile at dani 's shocked expression ."
"`` a thousand ? ''"
"`` or more , '' she said ."
"`` the responses are still coming in . ''"
"`` more than a thousand ? ''"
"dani gasped ."
"`` that 's not possible to pull something so elaborate together in such a short period of time . ''"
"jalla only smiled ."
"`` you do n't know kalil very well ."
"when he wants something , he gets it ."
"and nothing will stand in his way , '' she said ."
"`` i was surprised myself when i grasped the large wedding ."
"i was initially under the impression that he wanted a small , subdued affair ."
"apparently i was incorrect . ''"
"dani was concerned about the mysterious expression on the younger woman 's face ."
"`` what are you not telling me ? ''"
"dani asked ."
"pattia entered the room at that moment so the topic changed ."
"eventually they walked to the courtyard and lunch was served ."
"there were several places set up besides the three dani was initially expecting ."
"it was n't until dani saw kalil and his brother walking towards the table that she understood ."
"dani looked down at her plate , refusing to look at kalil or even acknowledge him ."
"she was so angry with him right at the moment ."
"everyone was going to see this wedding ."
"all her friends were going to be at the smaller wedding and she knew she would be embarrassed when she was put aside so kalil could marry someone more acceptable ."
"`` good afternoon , '' kalil said and sat down next to dani ."
"as soon as kalil was seated , the lunch was served ."
"it was a delicious , light meal of fresh salmon and a tossed salad with a delicious vinaigrette dressing on it ."
"of all the wonderful scents that arrived , dani was more thrilled than anything when a bowl of strawberries was placed in front of her plate ."
"her eyes finally snapped up to kalil 's and he winked at her , forcing her face to turn red when she understood that he was behind the gesture ."
"she did n't mind ."
"the craving for strawberries was too intense ."
"she dug into them and everyone laughed , also understanding that dani 's body was under the control of hormones right now ."
"the talk was lively between the main players but dani noticed that jalla and jasim did n't talk to each other ."
"in fact , jalla was acting towards jasim exactly the way she was acting towards kalil ."
"dani decided it was time to do something about this situation ."
"if jalla was in love with kalil 's brother , surely it would n't be too awful of a situation for the two to put the contract aside and marry each other ."
"she tried not to think what that would mean for her and kalil ."
"there was still the idea that she was completely inadequate to become queen in his mind ."
"`` will everyone be ready to leave in three hours ? ''"
"kalil asked ."
"`` leave ? ''"
"dani asked , wondering what he was talking about ."
"`` yes ."
"we leave for london tonight , '' he explained ."
"`` why ? ''"
"she asked ."
"with a nod , kalil excused the rest of the group from the table ."
"dani watched in amazement at the power he had even over his household ."
"`` how do you do that ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` do what ? ''"
"`` dismiss people without saying anything . ''"
"`` i do n't know ."
"it is just something that comes with the title , i supposed . ''"
"dani shrugged that away , not really caring what the issue was ."
"`` so why are we leaving for london tonight ? ''"
"`` because you have severe morning sickness , '' he explained ."
"`` i thought it would be better for you to be in a hotel room by the time you go to sleep so you can sleep through the morning sickness tomorrow ."
"the wedding is set for one o'clock in the afternoon and we 'll have lunch with your friends and family before heading back here for the ceremony the following day . ''"
"dani was touched by his thoughtfulness ."
"`` that sounds lovely , '' she said , looking down at her hands ."
"`` you 're still resisting this because of the future , are n't you ? ''"
"he asked , putting a hand to her cheek ."
"`` yes ."
"i ca n't help it ."
"i do n't think this is a good idea . ''"
"`` i think it is a wonderful idea ."
"would it make you feel better if i demanded that jalla marry my brother instead of me ? ''"
"dani 's eyes shot up to his ."
"`` you know ? ''"
"kalil smiled slightly ."
"`` know that my former fiancee is in love with my brother ?"
"and that the feelings are reciprocated ? ''"
"`` well , yes ... actually , '' dani replied , miffed that he was so observant ."
"`` you never gave away any clue that you noticed . ''"
"`` there are many things i notice , '' he replied ."
"`` for instance , i noticed that you were very quiet all through the lunch and only ate strawberries while pretending to pick at your other food ."
"i also noticed that you have a wonderful smile that has been missing for the past few days ."
"could it be that you are in love with me and afraid to allow those feelings to flourish ? ''"
"dani shoved back her chair and stood up ."
"`` do n't tease me , kalil ."
"it is n't fair . ''"
"she felt him move behind her ."
"`` why do you think i 'm teasing you ? ''"
"dani snorted ."
"`` let 's face it ."
"you have just about anything you want and if you do n't , all you have to do is ask ."
"and now you have one more woman falling at your feet . ''"
"`` are you the woman falling at my feet , danielle ? ''"
"`` yes ."
"but i 'm trying to get up and stop the pathetic display . ''"
"`` i do n't think it is pathetic . ''"
"`` of course you do n't ."
"you love having people fawn over you , '' she sniffed , wishing she could hold back the tears that were threatening to fall ."
"`` but i wo n't let you hurt me , '' she said strongly ."
"`` it is n't fair . ''"
"`` i love you as well , '' he said , turning her to face him just as a tear slipped over her lower lashes ."
"`` i love you with all my heart , '' he said ."
"`` you do ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` of course i do ."
"why do you think i was out of my mind searching for you the day you tried to run away from me ?"
"why do you think i made you move into my rooms ? ''"
"`` to keep an eye on me , '' she said , taking a deep breath ."
"he shook his head ."
"`` no ."
"i could have had you guarded by my personal body guards ."
"i wanted you near me ."
"it was too much to slip away from you every night ."
"i wanted you by my side , day and night . ''"
"dani looked away ."
"`` if you loved me , you 'd really want to marry me ."
"it would n't be for this baby . ''"
"`` i want you completely ."
"the baby was only justification for keeping you close ."
"do n't think there is any other reason . ''"
"`` but we ca n't be together , kalil ."
"you 've already told me that . ''"
"`` i was a fool , '' he ground out ."
"`` i did n't like the hold you had over me ."
"you ruled my mind and my body ."
"i 'd never lost control like i had with you and i did n't like it ."
"i used the excuse of only marrying you for a short period of time so i could convince myself that i was my own man ."
"it is a hard feeling to know that someone else has control of your mind and heart ."
"give me time ."
"i promise i 'll be a bit less dense in the future . ''"
"for the first time in a long time , dani started to feel hope ."
"`` really ? ''"
"she whispered ."
"`` really ."
"now do you think you could admit how you feel for me ?"
"since we 're getting married in the morning , i 'd really like to kiss you and let you know exactly how i feel , '' he said ."
"`` please feel free , '' she laughed , the tears streaming down her face but they were tears of happiness now ."
"she was feeling incredibly free and wonderful ."
"`` you really love me ? ''"
"she asked , putting her arms around his shoulders ."
"`` completely enslaved by you , '' he said a moment before his mouth captured hers ."
"`` i love you too , '' she said as he picked her up in his arms and carried her down the palace hallways toward their rooms ."
"chapter 13 dani stood in the center of the room , surrounded by her family , friends , co-workers , presidents and dignitaries from all over the world ."
"she was dressed in the blue dress with her hair covered with matching blue silk and small gold disks dancing around her face , hands and wrists ."
"smiling up at the gorgeous man , she thought back to the day before when there were less than twenty five people witnessing her vows to this man ."
"he 'd been dressed in morning gray and she 'd worn the beautiful white wedding dress ."
"but even now , as she listened to kalil express his words of love and vows of security and care , she felt more married now when he expressed his own vows than during the traditional vows that she 'd always thought would bind her to her husband ."
"`` i love you with all my heart , '' she said in arabic back to him ."
"at the end of the ceremony , kalil escorted her around the room ."
"within moments , her arms were filled with lovely , fragrant flowers of all shapes and sizes ."
"and there were still more to come !"
"it was so wonderful she could barely even breathe for fear that she might wake up from her dream ."
"later that night as she lay naked in the security of kalil 's arms , she whispered , `` i love you , '' again , then was greeted by the words and his strong arms closing around her ."
"he truly was the prince of her dreams ."
"chapter 1 shanelle basara tugged the formal gown higher , irritated that she even had to wear such an outfit ."
"it was ridiculous that she was here , much less all dolled up for some arrogant , conceited jerk ."
"she 'd made it quite clear to the powers-that-be that she wanted nothing to do with this weekend , but here she was ."
"unfortunately , it was n't like she could simply ignore the summons ."
"he was the sheik !"
"but why was she here ?"
"as shanelle looked around , there were so many eager , excited women , most of whom were much more beautiful and poised than she was ."
"of course , some of those differences she had fostered intentionally ."
"she 'd purposely played down her looks with almost no makeup and possibly the most unflattering dress she could find ."
"the halter style dress was a silvery grey which she thought made her skin look pale and sallow ."
"the cut of the dress made her hips look huge and her boobs were barely visible , unlike many of the other choices on the ladies present ."
"the cut of the hemline probably showed a bit too much leg , but it was the best she could do on such short notice ."
"she was n't fat by anyone 's definition , but she refused to starve herself like so many other women ."
"she had a tiny waist but who cared about a waistline ?"
"her legs were fine , but not overly toned like the woman to shanelle 's right ."
"nor were they long and slender like the woman to her left ."
"she walked beside her mother and father feeling inadequate , self-conscious and resentful , wishing she were anyone and anywhere else ."
"she did n't understand why so many women had been invited to a huge ball at the palace ."
"if the rumors were true , then the sheik was trying to find a wife ."
"but the man was thirty-six years old and had remained unmarried until this point ."
"why would he bow to tradition and marry now ?"
"it did n't make any sense ."
"of course , it did n't make much sense for her and her parents to be here either ."
"her father was well off and well liked in the government , but he was n't a high ranking officer or agency leader ."
"her mother did n't work , but she helped her father through socializing , which shanelle knew was a very powerful part of life in kanaan ."
"as in many government political careers , much of the work of government was done during social events , during quiet negotiations over a glass of wine or bourbon , ending in a handshake ."
"but that had nothing to do with shanelle , so it was very strange for her to be invited when she 'd never been a part of their social network before now ."
"so the rumors must be true about the sheik needing to find a wife ."
"since that was n't a position to which shanelle aspired , she wanted to turn around and head back home , curl up on her overstuffed chair and read a good book ."
"of course , she could also afford to put in a few more hours studying for the law exams which she 'd signed up to take next month ."
"as she waited in line to be announced , she looked around , trying to figure out how to get out of this ridiculous charade ."
"she did n't want to be noticed , she wanted to blend in ."
"to be in the background ."
"`` dad , i need to run to freshen up , '' she said and slipped her hand from his arm before he could argue with her ."
"she smiled at her mother to reassure her , but spun around on her heel and headed in the opposite direction ."
"she stopped one of the servants who was carrying a tray of champagne glasses , asking where the ladies ' room was , and then made her way there as quickly as possible ."
"if she were very lucky , she could stay in the luxurious area until all the announcements were finished ."
"shanelle had a plan ."
"it was n't a very good plan , but it would allow her to remain invisible ."
"slipping back out after ten minutes , she surveyed the hallway ."
"there was still a line of people moving towards the ballroom , but at least her parents were already inside ."
"that meant she did n't have to go through the formal announcement of her arrival ."
"that meant she could be anonymous !"
"she grinned as she picked up her skirts and slipped down the hallway where all the waiters were moving back and forth ."
"it would be so much easier to be invisible if she could go in through the servants ' entrance instead of the main doorway ."
"she suspected the sheik and his entourage were waiting at the bottom of the staircase , greeting each of the guests as they were introduced ."
"with a smile of delight , she peered down the hallway , excited to have snubbed the sheik in such a way ."
"it was small and possibly petty , but with such a powerful man , it was n't a good idea to snub him blatantly ."
"so these small rebellions were all she could safely contrive ."
"she stopped at the corner , then turned slightly and peered down the hallway , trying to figure out if it was safe to enter through this hallway or if she should find another ."
"malik badri del rahal , sheik of kanaan , spotted the flash of silver out of the corner of his eye ."
"raising his hand , there was immediate silence from his aide who was walking beside him ."
"if there had n't been numerous attempts on his life recently , he never would have agreed to this weekend ."
"but even malik accepted that the best way to stop the assassination attempts was to marry quickly and produce an heir ."
"or several heirs , as he had been advised on numerous occasions ."
"malik had resisted the idea , preferring to concentrate on keeping the country growing ."
"the idea of taking the time out to marry and produce an heir seemed like a ridiculous waste ."
"but after the fourth attempt on his life , malik knew that something drastic had to be done ."
"it was n't that he did n't like the company of women ."
"no , he definitely enjoyed that part of life ."
"with great relish , even !"
"it was just the idea of being tied down to one woman that bothered him ."
"his advisors had told him over and over again that being married did n't mean he could n't enjoy variety ."
"he 'd just have to be more discreet about it ."
"the idea left a bad taste in his mouth , but he 'd gone along with the marriage idea ."
"and the most expedient way to accomplish the task was to gather as many eligible women to the palace and simply select one that would get the job done ."
"this was the third such weekend , and so far , no woman had captured his attention ."
"at this point , malik was willing to just point to one of them and have the decision over with ."
"it seemed crude , but he was tired of these weekends filled with balls and elaborate dinners ."
"he had things to do , and taking time to socialize with a group of overly made up , primped and starved women just did n't seem like a good use of anyone 's time or money ."
"the flash of silver disappeared down the servants ' hallway and malik walked quickly in that direction , determined to capture whoever was sneaking into the ballroom ."
"he knew it was n't a servant , since they were in gold and maroon uniforms ."
"the thought crossed his mind that , if he could capture the silver flash , perhaps he could get some answers on the plot to get rid of him ."
"if he could find out who was trying to kill him , he could eliminate the threat and there would n't be an urgent need for him to marry and produce an heir ."
"malik knew that his aide was following , uncertain as to why they were n't heading towards the ballroom ."
"people were gathering already , eager to see the sheik and present their daughters for inspection ."
"but what he saw as he turned the corner was more fascinating than any criminal intent ."
"the curved , lush bottom pointing in his direction caused his body to react with unexpected interest ."
"why would someone send a female to kill him ?"
"when the cute bottom disappeared under the voluminous ball gown , he watched with rising interest as a long , slender leg protruded from the front ."
"the woman pulled the silver material over that leg but malik did n't mind since that only drew his eye up higher ."
"the lovely , enticing view of the woman 's breast captured his attention ."
"he could only see the side , and most of her breast was covered in the fabulous dress , but there was enough of a glimpse to capture his interest ."
"so the evening was n't going to be a total bore after all , he thought with relish ."
"malik slipped down the hallway , signaling to his guards to get ahead of the woman by the parallel hallway but not to catch her ."
"they were to stand down while he figured out what she was up to ."
"while he watched , the silver clad beauty tip toed down the hallway ."
"why she was trying to be so quiet was a mystery , but she looked adorable as she peeked down each perpendicular hallway , giving him yet another view of her adorable derriere ."
"as she continued to move down the hallway , he started to suspect that the woman was n't of the criminal variety ."
"she was too obvious and had very little stealth ."
"besides , there was something about the expression on her face that just did n't jive with someone intent on murder ."
"she looked too gleeful , too delighted on mischief ."
"when she reached the end of the hallway , he moved closer , intent on seeing her face ."
"after examining her body for the past several minutes , he admitted that he was more than a little intrigued ."
"spellbound would be a better description ."
"moving closer , he watched with interest as she crossed her fingers behind her , then peered around the opening to the ballroom ."
"it was now or never , he thought ."
"and there was no way he would allow this little beauty to be lost in the crowd , which is what he now suspected she was trying to do ."
"an assassin would n't be crossing her fingers behind her back ."
"she would be pulling out a gun or other weapon ."
"nor would she be wearing a silver gown that caught the light , making her whole figure sparkle ."
"no , an assassin would blend in , possibly wearing a black gown or maybe even brown ."
"something many other women wore ."
"or she would dress as a waiter ."
"but even then , she would stand out ."
"that black , shiny hair that was twisted on the back of her head highlighted her delicate bone structure ."
"she really was a stunning beauty , he thought as the light from the ballroom illuminated her features ."
"her eyes were a dark , chocolate brown , her skin a creamy color with peach highlights which he did n't think was due to makeup ."
"she had long , thick eyelashes that surrounded those almond-shaped eyes , making her appear sensuous without loads of makeup ."
"even the fact that she wore less than half the makeup as the other women would make her stand out ."
"not to mention the excitement in her lovely , expressive eyes when she bit her full , lower lip ."
"no , this woman was n't an assassin ."
"he was literally staking his life on that instinct as he moved closer and leaned against the wall right behind her ."
"in this position , she was currently too occupied looking around the corner , but he could see right down that lovely dress to those breasts that his hands suddenly ached to hold and explore ."
"they were full and luscious and the cut of her dress gave him an enticing view of the deep v and interesting shadows ."
"his eyes noticed the bow holding the halter-style bodice in place and he wanted very desperately to pull that teasing string so he could view those breasts fully ."
"he resisted the urge , but knew that he would get the opportunity ."
"she was just too alluring for him to resist ."
"assassin or innocent , he would have this woman in his bed ."
"in that moment , he accepted that this woman was either going to be his next mistress or his wife , the choice was up to her ."
"suddenly , the idea of marriage did n't seem nearly as dull as it had only five minutes ago ."
"he suspected that this woman would be a bewitching enticement into the matrimonial state ."
"shanelle felt something warm behind her but that did n't make any sense ."
"the wait staff were all out in the ballroom distributing drinks and trays of appetizers ."
"her whole body went cold with sudden tingling that felt spookily close to fear ."
"she became very still ."
"standing up straight , she tried to use her peripheral vision to figure out what had changed ."
"to the left of her , she saw a stern , terrifyingly bulky man in a tuxedo ."
"to the right of her , another one stood with his hands folded in front of him ."
"both of them were looking straight at her ."
"her breath caught in her throat and she suddenly knew that she 'd been caught !"
"were these the palace security guards who were about to have her tossed out of the building ?"
"well , that would be embarrassing , she thought quickly , unaware that she was biting her lower lip ."
"but it would definitely serve her purpose ."
"her father could n't really blame her if she was evicted from the ball , could he ?"
"okay , so he would eventually find out that she was sneaking down the servants ' hallway ."
"and he would know exactly what she was trying to do ."
"but could he blame her ?"
"she decided to turn around and head back down the hallway ."
"she did n't really want to deal with her father 's wrath if he found out that she 'd tried to sneak in and been ignominiously tossed out of the event ."
"turning around , she prayed that the guards would allow her to just slip back where she 'd come from ."
"maybe they would think ..."
"in that instant , she realized with a jolt that the man standing behind her was no mere palace security guard !"
"`` oh crap ! ''"
"she snapped , then realized what she 'd just said ."
"`` i did n't just say crap ! ''"
"she told the man , covering her mouth with her hand as she stared up into his amused , dark eyes ."
"`` you did n't hear that , did you ? ''"
"she asked , but the increasing laughter in those black eyes told her that he had definitely heard her ."
"she peered around the man 's extremely large body and looked down the hallway ."
"`` are you following me ? ''"
"she asked with accusation in her voice ."
"malik could n't stop the laughter as she glared up at him ."
"`` of course i followed you , '' he said with a smooth , deep voice ."
"`` i thought you were an assassin trying to sneak into the ballroom . ''"
"shanelle rolled her eyes , then realized what she was doing and who she was talking to and gasped with horror at her monumental faux pas ."
"she rallied quickly , not liking the feeling of being wrong , and straightened her shoulders ."
"being on the offensive was a much better position for her anyway ."
"`` why are n't you in the ballroom anyway ? ''"
"she asked desperately ."
"`` you 're supposed to be in there meeting and greeting , '' she groaned , stomping her foot with increasing frustration and some other strange , almost queasy sensation in her stomach that she could n't quite define ."
"`` you 're not where you 're supposed to be ! ''"
"malik chuckled again , pushing away from the wall ."
"`` i apologize for being out of place , '' he said and reached down to take her hand ."
"with old-world chivalry , he raised her hand and kissed her fingers but those dark eyes promised so much more ."
"shanelle felt the shock when his fingers touched hers and she immediately wanted to pull her hand away ."
"he anticipated her move and tightened his hand around her fingers , refusing to release her hand ."
"instead , he tucked it onto the curve of his elbow , pulling her close ."
"she did n't want the 'more ' that appeared in those dark eyes of his ."
"she wanted to flee , to run as fast as she could away from him ."
"her other hand covered her stomach as the queasy feeling turned strange ."
"almost as if a whole bunch of butterflies were fitting around in her stomach ."
"she looked up at the man , wondering what was going on ."
"`` what do you want ? ''"
"she asked warily , trying to keep her body away from his large form , but it was difficult with her arm in this position ."
"`` you 're making me very nervous . ''"
"shanelle could n't see his features very well in the dim hallway light , but she knew sheik rahal was considered a very attractive man ."
"as she looked up at him , it occurred to her that he was n't handsome in the traditional sense ."
"his features were too hard , too dark ."
"the idea of a 'hunter ' came to mind as she looked at him and the shivering started inside of her ."
"was she the prey ?"
"she did n't want to even be close to him , much less get his attention ."
"`` i think my plan has completely backfired , '' she said under her breath ."
"`` what plan was that ? ''"
"he asked as he moved into the ballroom ."
"shanelle blinked as they stepped out into the bright , overhead lights ."
"`` to avoid you , '' she whispered , her face turning pink as all eyes looked in their direction ."
"`` damn it !"
"why could n't you be where you were supposed to be ? ''"
"she demanded , but the force of her words was diminished by the trembling that was now all over her as he wrapped his arms around her and nodded to the small orchestra to start playing ."
"`` i do n't want to dance with you , '' she snapped and tried to put a little space between their bodies ."
"malik was having none of that ."
"now that this lush beauty was in his arms , the evening was suddenly much more interesting ."
"`` that is unfortunate , '' he stated as his arm tightened around her waist , pulling her even closer so that her hips were touching his ."
"he heard her gasp from the contact and waited for her to look up at him ."
"the music began and he started dancing , initially pulling her along with him but she rallied quickly ."
"the feel of her in his arms was even better than he 'd imagined ."
"she was soft in all the right places with a sparkle in her eyes and a spunky personality ."
"even her frustration at being in his arms was alluring since it was so unusual for a woman to resist him ."
"and she could dance !"
"the delightful woman was light on her feet , never tripping and accepting his lead ."
"he could n't say that he 'd become bored with the women in his life ."
"he 'd been more than pleasured by his various mistresses over the years ."
"but as he pulled this beauty along in his arms , he realized that he wanted so much more in a woman that someone who simply complied with his commands ."
"he wanted someone with a mind of her own , someone who would challenge him ."
"looking down into her dark and furious , yet scared eyes , malik instinctively knew that this woman would challenge him in ways he could n't even anticipate ."
"and her allure ratcheted up several notches ."
"he almost laughed when his body responded ."
"he knew the instant that she felt it as well and her wary eyes looked up at him ."
"but he could also see that she was just as affected ."
"the pulse at the base of her neck was going at a rapid pace ."
"her pupils were dilated and her entire body trembled in his arms ."
"he did n't want her nervous ."
"he wanted her willing and eager ."
"she was a complete novelty and he eagerly anticipated discovering all of her secrets ."
"shanelle wanted to pull out of his arms and run down the hallway , to hide in some dark place where he could never find her ."
"she hated feeling this way , preferred tackling life head on , but there was something about this man that just struck her as innately terrifying ."
"she did n't want to feel this way ."
"she did n't want to be affected by his touch , or shivering in anticipation ."
"she did n't want her mind to even consider what it would be like to be kissed by those firm lips or wonder what his callused fingers would feel like on her skin ."
"but the more he held her , the more she knew that her body was betraying her mind 's requests ."
"she could n't seem to put enough space between their bodies to avoid feeling the hardness that was actually increasing as they danced ."
"`` you 're scaring me , '' she whispered , looking directly at the middle of his chest ."
"`` look at me when you talk to me , '' he ordered softly but with absolute command ."
"shanelle hated being told what to do but in this case , she tilted her head back and glared at him ."
"`` do n't order me ! ''"
"she snapped right back at him ."
"`` i do n't take well to commands ! ''"
"malik looked down into his spitfire 's eyes and wanted to laugh with delight ."
"`` i think there may be a few commands you wo n't mind following ."
"once i get you into the right frame of mind . ''"
"she immediately shook her head ."
"`` i have n't ever done well with someone telling me what to do ."
"do n't bother ."
"it generally backfires on my father . ''"
"one dark eyebrow went up in inquiry ."
"`` i imagine that the things i would order you to do would be significantly different than the commands from your father . ''"
"he chuckled when his words caused her blush to deepen and her trembling increased ."
"`` but i also suspect that you wo n't mind my commands ."
"eventually . ''"
"she took a deep breath and tried to regain some measure of control ."
"`` why are you dancing with me ?"
"why do n't you dance with someone who is interested ? ''"
"he smiled at her blatant challenge ."
"`` are you trying to convince me that you do n't feel the attraction between us ?"
"or are you trying to convince yourself ? ''"
"she was so shocked by his comment that she was n't sure how to respond ."
"`` you do n't beat around the bush , do you ? ''"
"she groaned ."
"`` when it is something i want ?"
"no . ''"
"`` you do n't really want me , '' she countered with increasing panic and looked around ."
"`` there are so many women here , why do n't you shine your illustrious presence on someone who would appreciate it ? ''"
"she spotted a woman on the sidelines glaring at them ."
"`` for instance , isla domani over there in the pink dress ."
"she is beautiful and poised ."
"she 's also very smart , working with an accounting firm right now . ''"
"she looked down slightly , her brow furrowing in confusion ."
"`` or at least i think she 's still working . ''"
"shanelle bit her lip , trying to remember other things that had come up about isla recently ."
"`` and what about you ? ''"
"he asked ."
"`` what is your background ? ''"
"shanelle shook her head ."
"`` oh , i 'm completely inappropriate , '' she stated emphatically ."
"malik laughed and raised his eyebrows ."
"`` in what way ? ''"
"shanelle cringed inwardly ."
"this was n't working , she thought ."
"`` i just finished law school in the united states , '' she stated , trying to show him that she was n't willing to be a boring wife who follows her husband around ."
"`` i am now studying to pass the legal hoops here in kanaan so that i can start practicing law here . ''"
"`` what sort of law would you like to do ? ''"
"he asked ."
"not that she would ever do that , he thought ."
"no , he had a completely different position that she would be filling ."
"the more he spoke to her , the more fascinated he was with both her personality and her intelligence ."
"and her creativity ."
"he could n't wait to see what she 'd come up with next to try and diminish his interest in her ."
"shanelle frowned and a different sort of sparkle entered her eyes ."
"`` i 'd like to work in family law ."
"but i 'm afraid i 'll get burned out after a while ."
"it 's a hard area to tackle ."
"i do n't think i would enjoy working with couples trying to divorce but i would still like to help those who are going through that difficult process if someone were taking advantage of them ."
"but since divorce is extremely rare here in kanaan , i 'm not focusing so much on that area as protecting children and families from issues they do n't understand . ''"
"he was impressed ."
"`` family law is a difficult area to break into ."
"one 's practice grows mostly by word of mouth . ''"
"she grimaced ."
"`` i know ."
"but one needs to do what one enjoys and is passionate about in order to be successful , right ? ''"
"she asked with the first sign of eagerness since he 'd snuck up behind her ."
"`` absolutely , '' he murmured , thinking of all the passionate things he would enjoy doing to her once he finally got her into his bed ."
"`` and it is n't as hard to get into that field as it used to be , '' she went on , oblivious to the sexual thoughts racing through his mind ."
"`` i mean , there are so many social media outlets now where a person can get their name to the people who are looking for help ."
"and then the word of mouth can start up ."
"i just need to get through kanaan law exams , then find a small office space . ''"
"she nodded with absolute conviction of her eventual success ."
"`` it will be okay , '' she smiled up at him ."
"malik took in her smile and his body reacted even more urgently ."
"he wanted that smile to be for him , he thought ."
"he pulled her closer as they spun around the dance area one more time ."
"she was obviously unaware that they 'd danced together for the last three songs but he was n't going to relent his hold on her ."
"`` so what were your dreams before you were pulled into your current role ? ''"
"she asked , her feet feeling like they were floating on air ."
"this man was an incredible dancer ."
"not once did he step on her toes or hesitate in his confident lead ."
"he was all muscle and towered over her , but he was n't clumsy as tall , bulky men usually were ."
"and should be , she thought with a sudden stab of mild resentment ."
"he lifted his dark eyebrow at her question ."
"`` why do you think i should have done something else with my life other than serve kanaan ? ''"
"he asked curiously ."
"from birth , he had known that he might eventually rule kanaan and he 'd never thought about doing anything else ."
"his country had grown in education , economics , technology , innovation and tourism under his rule and he intended to expand that growth even further in the future ."
"if his older brother had indicated a desire and aptitude for sound leadership , he would have done something to help kanaan expand and prosper ."
"it was in his blood , an ever-present duty to his country ."
"she shrugged one delicate shoulder as she tilted her head ."
"`` i remember that you were the third or fourth oldest ."
"you were n't in line for the throne originally , were you ? ''"
"malik nodded his head ."
"`` i was second . ''"
"`` so did n't you have something you wanted to do other than be in charge of all this chaos ? ''"
"he did n't want to go into that , so he answered her question with a question ."
"`` why do you think ruling kanaan is chaotic ? ''"
"he asked ."
"she laughed up at him ."
"`` are you kidding me ?"
"all the political movements , the power struggles , the parliament that keeps passing laws that you then dismiss with a flick of your pen ? ''"
"she shook her head ."
"`` sometimes i wish you 'd just disband that irritating crowd and make everyone vote all over again . ''"
"he chuckled as well because that thought occurred to him almost daily ."
"`` it 's an enticing idea , '' he replied honestly ."
"`` so what would you be doing if your father had permitted your older brother to rule kanaan ? ''"
"he raised an eyebrow ."
"`` possibly doing exactly what my brothers are currently doing . ''"
"shanelle laughed and shook her head ."
"`` no ."
"i doubt it . ''"
"she looked at him with serious eyes ."
"`` i ca n't imagine you laying about the various resort areas of the world drinking and doing drugs , cavorting frivolously . ''"
"she bit her lip a moment before she said , `` is that why your father took them out of the line of ascension ? ''"
"she asked carefully ."
"`` were they already showing signs of debauchery at an earlier age ? ''"
"malik did n't want to get into the details so he just said , `` i do n't know what my father was thinking during that period in his life , '' he lied ."
"malik had been happily developing his own career in the military although he still had to live in the palace ."
"but when his father had called a family meeting of all the men and divulged that his oldest and youngest sons would be denied the right to rule because of their proclivities , it had fallen to malik to take the reins ."
"he had n't wanted that , had been ready to work his way up the military path but fate and his father had other plans ."
"now , his brothers were watched constantly to see if they are the ones behind the assassination attempts ."
"it suddenly occurred to shanelle that they had been dancing for quite a while ."
"looking around , she noticed several glares from the other women around the room ."
"`` i think we should stop , '' she said , hoping he would release her and dance with other women ."
"that was not going to happen , unfortunately ."
"he walked her off of the dance floor , but he would n't release her hand ."
"as he moved about the ballroom , he introduced her to everyone he spoke with , included her in the conversations , asked her opinions about the various subjects and basically kept her by his side ."
"when they reached her parents , her father was beaming with pride ."
"why he would care so much about his youngest daughter catching the eye of a man , she 'd never understand ."
"he had n't even been this proud when she 'd graduated from law school !"
"`` mr. basara , ms. basara , '' he said cooling , bowing slightly when she introduced them , `` i would like to invite you and your daughter to join me here at the palace ."
"i would sincerely like to get to know your delightful daughter better and i 'm sure she would be more comfortable with you here in residence as well . ''"
"shanelle 's mouth dropped open with horror , not sure what to say or do to discourage this terrifying turn of events ."
"but when her mother and father both eagerly agreed , she knew that she was trapped ."
"chapter 2 shanelle paced through the breakfast room , her heels clicking on the marble floor , but nothing seemed to be able to stop her frantic thoughts ."
"she had to get out of this ."
"this entire situation was going in the wrong direction ."
"how had she messed up her plans so completely ?"
"how had she gotten into such a predicament ?"
"if only she 'd stayed with her parents last night ."
"she could n't believe that her idea of being inconspicuous had so completely backfired ."
"why had n't the man simply been where he was expected to be ?"
"why had she even tried to circumvent the social niceties ?"
"if she 'd just gone with the flow , she 'd probably be home in her own room right now , reviewing her books so she could take the law exam next month ."
"she 'd completely screwed everything up !"
"but that did n't mean she was going to ruin her whole life ."
"shanelle was not going to fall under that man 's spell ."
"he was too powerful and held all the control ."
"she was n't a woman who liked to be told what to do , and rebelled at even the thought of someone trying to command her mind and spirit ."
"malik was n't likely to approve of her stubbornness and independence , and in the end , they would hate each other ."
"she was n't going to be tied to a man she despised , and there was absolutely no way she was going to get pregnant ."
"no , shanelle simply could n't do it ."
"she had to get out of this fix somehow ."
"`` you look tormented , '' the deep voice said and shanelle spun around as malik entered the breakfast room ."
"he looked amazingly good and shanelle swallowed painfully ."
"`` what 's on your mind ? ''"
"he asked as he stopped less than an inch from her , looking down into her worried eyes ."
"`` i do n't like the implication of my presence here this weekend . ''"
"there , she 'd said it and he could take it however he wanted ."
"she did n't care ."
"after a sleepless night worrying about what to do and say to malik , she just wanted to get that out into the open ."
"malik chuckled , not offended by her adamant statement in the least ."
"in fact , he 'd expected it and was impressed that she was n't afraid to speak her mind ."
"`` i think i 've already gotten that sense ."
"the question is why do n't you want to be here ? ''"
"she squared her shoulders , refusing to give in to the trembling his nearness caused ."
"`` i do n't like what this means ."
"people will start to think that ... . ''"
"she could n't finish ."
"the idea of what they might think was too crazy ."
"`` why am i here ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he took pity on her , noting the dark circles under her eyes and the fatigue that seemed to emanate from her whole body ."
"`` for exactly the reason you think , '' he said with complete honesty ."
"she swallowed and blinked , trying to focus ."
"`` rumor has it that you 're looking for a wife . ''"
"`` i am ."
"i need to marry and have children , as do most other men and women in the world . ''"
"`` why am i here ? ''"
"`` because i want you ."
"and because you are a beautiful woman and i find myself painfully attracted to you . ''"
"as he spoke , his hands moved to her waist , pulling her close enough so that she was flush against his body ."
"`` i do n't have the time to go through all the normal courtship rituals ."
"so my aides expedited the situation by bringing several females to the palace . ''"
"`` and you 're to choose one of them for your wife . ''"
"`` that 's the plan . ''"
"he was n't sure , but he suspected that she was angry about his answer ."
"`` most women would be flattered that they were chosen . ''"
"he watched her face carefully ."
"`` i 'm guessing you 're not one of those women ? ''"
"`` you guess correctly , '' she said and pulled out of his arms ."
"instantly , she felt cold without his heat close to her , but she crossed her arms , refusing to appreciate that there might be some benefits to being with him ."
"she knew from experience that those benefits faded quickly ."
"she took several steps away , aware of servants and palace staff passing by outside of the breakfast room ."
"`` this all sounds like that old cinderella fairy tale ."
"but i 'm not a poverty stricken woman who wants to be lifted up out of her oppressive household by a man she 's never met before ."
"what if i do n't want to be considered ? ''"
"she asked , hoping against hope that he could be reasonable ."
"malik wanted to laugh ."
"he could still see her nipples through the thin material of her blouse so he knew she was as affected by their nearness as he was ."
"so why was she fighting this attraction ?"
"shanelle basara became more fascinating with every conversation ."
"she was like a puzzle that he needed to figure out ."
"`` then i guess i 'll have to show you my sterling qualities and perhaps we can work out a compromise . ''"
"she shifted on her feet , eyeing him warily ."
"`` i did n't think there was much compromise in a relationship with a man like you ."
"and i have n't heard of much compromise in your dealings with parliament ."
"are you saying that you would treat me differently ? ''"
"`` yes . ''"
"of course he would treat his wife differently than the others in parliament and his government officials ."
"he had no desire to make love to any of those people ."
"he did n't think she 'd appreciate his humor though so he kept that thought to himself ."
"`` then what sort of compromise would there be ?"
"you 've already mentioned several commands you want to give me ."
"i ca n't imagine what enticement there might be in marriage for the woman . ''"
"malik chuckled and took her hand once again ."
"`` let 's walk ."
"i do n't think you want others to hear this conversation . ''"
"`` i do n't think i want to have any conversation with you ."
"this is n't a situation i want to be in anyway ."
"there are so many other women who would love to be in my place ."
"please , just take a look around . ''"
"she pulled back but he simply put an arm around her waist and guided her out the door anyway ."
"`` unfortunately for you , it is you that i want in my bed . ''"
"she gasped ."
"never had a man been so blatant ."
"`` that 's not true !"
"i just represent a challenge ! ''"
"she bit her lip and thought frantically as he pulled her deeper into the darkness ."
"`` if i throw myself at you will you be turned off ? ''"
"she asked , knowing immediately how ridiculous that statement sounded ."
"he laughed again and looked down at her ."
"`` why do n't you try it and i 'll let you know ? ''"
"she scowled into the darkness ."
"`` oh , shut up ."
"i knew how stupid that came out even before the statement ended . ''"
"she crossed her arms over her chest defensively , ignoring his laughter ."
"he 'd led her out into a lovely courtyard filled with fragrant flowers and lush greenery ."
"she did n't want to be in this romantic spot and longed for the business of the palace once again ."
"`` so what do you want to talk about ?"
"let 's get this conversation over with so you can talk to some other women ."
"we 're becoming a spectacle , '' she stated firmly ."
"she could see people watching the two of them even out here in the garden ."
"but why would n't they ?"
"rumors were flying that this man was looking for a wife and just about every single woman in the kingdom , in the world really , and probably some of the married ones , would sell their souls to the devil to be the woman he chose ."
"he led her over to a terrace that offered them much more privacy ."
"`` tell me more about yourself . ''"
"she became stubborn as she saw several other women glaring at her from a distance ."
"she recognized several of them from the ball last night and started to feel a sense of relief ."
"it was only a small sense , but any sort of reprieve helped her mentally to get through this ."
"the presence of the other women must mean that he was n't focused exclusively on her ."
"maybe those other women were in contention for his hand as well ."
"`` no ."
"i do n't want to know anything about you and i do n't want you to know anything about me . ''"
"he stepped in front of her , blocking her view of the other women ."
"`` ah , so you want to remain the mysterious stranger that continues to haunt my dreams , eh ? ''"
"`` absolutely not ! ''"
"she snapped and put a hand to the middle of his chest ."
"her intent was to push him away but her hand snapped back away from that touch and her worried eyes shot up to his ."
"she could n't see his reaction in the dark , but she felt it ."
"she might not be touching him any longer , but she still could feel the increased heat ."
"his hands , which had been in his pockets for the last few moments , came out and slowly , as if in slow motion , took her hand and placed it back on his chest ."
"shanelle 's eyes were n't looking at his any longer , but they were still wide with shock ."
"and no matter how many times she tried to pull her hand away , it slid down his chest , exploring those muscles underneath ."
"when they flinched under her fingertips and palm , she looked back up at him ."
"`` yes , you do this to me , '' he explained with a gravelly voice ."
"`` no woman has ever made me feel like this before , '' he said ."
"`` so now you understand why i am focused on you as opposed to the other women in the room and why i 'm not going to allow you ignore this thing between us ."
"it is rare for two people to be this attracted to each other and we 're going to explore it together . ''"
"she heard his words and wondered about them ."
"`` it ca n't last , '' she whispered , still shifting her hand along his muscular chest , unable to pull herself away from him ."
"he sucked in his breath when her fingers accidentally moved over his flat , male nipple ."
"`` shut up , shanelle , '' he groaned and moved closer ."
"when his mouth covered hers , the flame of desire that she 'd been ignoring flared up to life ."
"it was n't a contained fire that could be examined and enjoyed ."
"no , this was one of those wild fires that consumed everything , flaming into life in every part of her body ."
"it destroyed her resistance , burned out her brain cells and heated up her entire body until she felt like she was going to explode into a cloud of ash ."
"she had no understanding of anything outside of his lips , his hands touching her waist and her back , pulling her closer ."
"and then his leg slipped between hers , pressing against her core while his hands pulled her hips against his ."
"hard ."
"she whimpered with increased need and her arms slid up from his chest to his neck , pulling herself closer to him ."
"she felt his hands shift , reveled in the amazing sensations ripping through her body ."
"but then his hand covered her breast through the fabric of her silk shirt and she gasped , ripping herself out of his embrace ."
"she stared up at him , her body braced for a fight , not sure what had just happened ."
"what had he done ?"
"what had she done ?"
"she stared up at him and watched with growing confusion as the fire in his eyes increased and a slow , sexy smile grew on those lips that had just been kissing her ."
"`` no man has ever touched your breasts ."
"am i right ? ''"
"he asked , his chest swelling with pride that this beautiful woman was so responsive ."
"to him ."
"she shook her head , trying to clear away the confusion but he knew that the only thing that would put that fire out and make sense was a culmination of what they 'd just been doing ."
"`` do n't fight it , shanelle , '' he said softly and stepped closer to her ."
"he wanted to comfort her but she stepped back , pressing into the bannister behind her ."
"he stopped , but only because he did n't want to frighten her any more ."
"what they 'd done together showed him without a doubt that the two of them would be sexually compatible ."
"`` why are you so afraid of me ? ''"
"he asked as he led her back towards the breakfast room ."
"shanelle looked around and realized that there was n't anyone else on the balcony ."
"`` where did everyone else go ? ''"
"she asked , more focused on that issue than his question ."
"malik looked around ."
"`` i think my guards cleared out the area and the windows so that i could kiss you without everyone witnessing . ''"
"shanelle groaned ."
"`` i ca n't believe you did that ! ''"
"she gasped ."
"`` why on earth would you give that sort of command to your guards ? ''"
"`` because i do n't enjoy others watching me . ''"
"he thought that would be self-explanatory ."
"she shook her head , her palm slapping against her forehead ."
"`` not that ! ''"
"she replied , shuddering at the idea of someone taking a picture of them kissing ."
"it would be on the internet already if that had happened ."
"`` first of all , you should n't have kissed me , '' she told him sternly ."
"`` and secondly , having your guards shoo everyone away just about advertised what you were doing ! ''"
"`` what we were doing , '' he corrected , emphasizing that she was a more than willing participant ."
"shanelle 's head bowed in shame ."
"`` yes ."
"i 'm sorry , but i ca n't do this , '' she said ."
"looking up at him she asked , `` is there a less obtrusive way to get back inside ? ''"
"she tried to come up with a logical reason why they would be out here together and then entering the breakfast area together but her mind came up blank ."
"`` if we just went in to breakfast from different directions , maybe no one will ask any questions or make assumptions . ''"
"malik considered her request ."
"he knew that if he walked into that breakfast room , every pair of eyes would watch ."
"it would almost be an announcement of his intentions ."
"and they would all know exactly what the two of them had been doing out on the balcony since shanelle 's lips were swollen from his kiss ."
"`` if i show you a back way , will you promise me something ? ''"
"he asked gently ."
"he too wanted his privacy ."
"if it had been any other woman , he probably would n't care ."
"but there was something about this delicate beauty that got to him ."
"he wanted to make her happy ."
"that was a feeling he had n't anticipated feeling towards his future spouse since this courtship had to be accomplished so quickly ."
"`` anything , '' she assured him instantly ."
"if it got her out of re-entering that ballroom on his arm , and possibly getting some space from him , she would promise to do just about anything ."
"he laughed softly at her eagerness and ran a finger down her cheek , enjoying the feel of her shivers as it trailed down her neck as well ."
"`` promise that you 'll be open to this weekend ."
"to me ."
"i wo n't deny that i have to marry and do so quickly ."
"but i had n't anticipated meeting someone like you . ''"
"shanelle swallowed ."
"she thought about what she could say , but getting to know a man like malik was not a good career move ."
"and then something occurred to her as she suddenly realized that she might really want this ."
"at least to get to know him ."
"`` i 'll be open to this weekend as long as you keep the other women here as well ."
"and you look to them as possible wives . ''"
"malik smothered a smile at that ."
"he knew from experience that the other women would n't affect him like this little lady did ."
"`` it 's a deal . ''"
"shanelle hesitated when he extended his hand ."
"from their kiss moments ago , she knew that touching him was ... .stimulating ."
"no !"
"no , it was dangerous !"
"she was n't stimulated by his touch ."
"in the end , she could n't resist the temptation any longer ."
"she actually braced for the impact of putting her hand into his but she still was n't prepared ."
"the heat that overwhelmed her as his large , strong hand engulfed hers was breathtaking ."
"she looked up at him and knew that he was feeling the exact same thing ."
"`` let 's go inside for breakfast , '' she suggested softly ."
"he did n't release her hand immediately ."
"she even felt a small tug , as if he were trying to bring her closer ."
"`` of course ."
"go off to the left and someone will meet you there ."
"i 'll come around from the opposite doorway . ''"
"he raised her hand to his mouth , his eyes holding her hostage as his lips touched her fingers ."
"she was n't aware of her mouth falling open or her body almost melting as those sparks of need tingled through her ."
"she could n't breathe , could n't pull away and wanted badly for him to kiss her again ."
"when he lifted his head again and stepped back , finally releasing her hand , she felt cold and suddenly bereft ."
"she actually opened her mouth to beg him to touch her again , then realized what she was doing and stopped ."
"closing her mouth firmly , she took a deep , sustaining breath , then turned around and followed the body guard that mysteriously appeared to the left of them ."
"shanelle looked back at him , trying to figure out how he could reduce her mind to mush so easily ."
"even last night , being held in his arms as they danced and walked about the ballroom , she 'd been aware of every movement of his body , every touch of his hand and the heat of him ."
"and now , as she looked back at him , she wanted to know what he was thinking ."
"she stopped her mind from even trying to guess ; she could feel his thoughts ."
"the heat and energy emanating from his tall , muscular body was enough to tell her exactly what he was thinking ."
"unfortunately , she was thinking it as well ."
"she turned away hurriedly and walked behind the guard , her head bowed in shame that she 'd reacted so intensely towards a man she 'd just met ."
"she did n't want a rich , powerful man for a spouse ."
"she wanted a partner ."
"chapter 3 that night , she was shown to a beautiful suite that even had a balcony that looked out over the city ."
"the lights of the streets and buildings twinkled in the distance while the stars sparkled overhead ."
"she could n't believe what had actually happened tonight ."
"why had he chosen her ?"
"she was n't special in any way ."
"she had dark hair , just like all the other women ."
"her brown eyes were unexceptional and her skin was good , but so many other women had the same creamy complexion ."
"shanelle knew there were beautiful blonds and sultry redheads somewhere in the palace , all who would dearly love to be chosen as the next baby maker ."
"since she had no idea how to get out of this , she really needed to come up with a plan ."
"she sat down in one of the chairs on the private balcony , looking out at the night ."
"there was a bit of amusement in all of this , she thought as she curled her legs up underneath her ."
"she did n't have her computer , so she could n't study or do any research ."
"she now had a change of clothes , although dinner tonight revealed that none of her current wardrobe would be suitable for meetings with the illustrious sheik rahal , and she had no book so she could n't even read ."
"so what was a girl to do when one did n't have any entertainment ?"
"she could possibly go to sleep , but she was n't really tired ."
"besides , it was only nine o'clock , she realized as she glanced at the clock on the wall ."
"she was normally tired about this time of the evening , being more of a morning person ."
"but there was too much going on in her life for her mind to shut down enough to sleep ."
"she had to chuckle at how badly her plans had gone awry ."
"she 'd tried to be inconspicuous and all she 'd done was put herself right in the path of the curious man she 'd specifically been trying to avoid ."
"she 'd tried to ignore the man during meals but he only started arguments with her , seeming to know exactly how to push her buttons and get her to join in the argument ."
"he was supposed to be flirting with the other women staying here at the palace , but he barely even glanced in their direction , despite their best attempts to lure his attention their way ."
"life was a bit out of control , she thought ."
"she snuggled more comfortably on the deep cushions , wondering why the man was so argumentative with her ."
"and why did n't he think that besrani tolame , the beautiful blond woman sitting to the right of him at dinner tonight , was a good candidate for his wife ?"
"not that she 'd thought the woman was very nice , she thought with a yawn ."
"the blond had irritated her to no end with her sappy stories about all the volunteer work she 'd supposedly done ."
"what a crock , shanelle thought as she leaned her head back against the soft cushion behind her ."
"malik looked down at the gorgeous woman who had fallen asleep on the chair out on her balcony ."
"the white material of her nightgown seemed conservative enough , but because of the cut of the gown , her long , slender legs were exposed to his viewing pleasure ."
"not to mention the bodice was loose enough to droop open , giving him an enticing view of the luscious swells of her breasts ."
"he 'd come here to make sure she was comfortable , intending only to knock on her door then move on down the hallway to his own suite of rooms ."
"but when there was n't an answer after he 'd knocked , and the body guards now assigned to protect her assured him that she had n't left through either the doorway or the balcony , he stepped inside the room ."
"he just wanted to make sure she was okay ."
"he could have sent a servant in , but for some reason , he wanted to see her himself ."
"the view he was now looking at , with her shimmering night gown draped around her and her long , black hair falling over her shoulder , he knew he 'd made the right decision ."
"he even liked the fact that she did n't want to be his wife ."
"he had to fight to win her , and he relished the challenge ."
"he bent down and lifted her into his arms , intending to take her to bed so she could sleep more comfortably ."
"he was stunned by how little she weighed ."
"he carried her to the bed and was just about to put her on the mattress when she woke up ."
"`` it 's you , '' she sighed ."
"`` were you expecting someone else ? ''"
"he asked as she wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her nose against his skin ."
"he almost growled with the need that surged through him with her sleepy touch ."
"she did n't know what she was doing , he reminded himself ."
"she was more than half asleep ."
"he needed to be a gentleman here ."
"but when her nose nuzzled his ear , his arms tightened around her ."
"`` i was n't expecting you at all ."
"you 're too strong , '' she sighed into his neck ."
"malik stood there with her in his arms , looking down at her ."
"`` is being too strong a bad thing ? ''"
"he asked , not sure where her mind was going with this ."
"`` yes . ''"
"`` why ? ''"
"she smiled slightly , but her eyes were still closed ."
"`` because i did n't realize that i liked strong men until i met you . ''"
"`` you preferred weak men ? ''"
"she laughed slightly , still sleepy ."
"`` definitely not ."
"but i like you . ''"
"malik groaned again when he felt her fingers touched his hair ."
"her fingers were n't still either , tangling in his hair and touching the sensitive skin on his neck ."
"the feeling shot right through him and he had to grit his teeth or he would ravish the woman right here ."
"`` would you mind kissing me again ? ''"
"she asked on a sigh ."
"malik looked down at her and saw that her eyes were now open ."
"`` i do n't think that would be a very good idea . ''"
"she grimaced ."
"`` probably not ."
"i was just hoping that the way i felt when you kissed me yesterday was just my imagination . ''"
"with those words , malik could n't stop himself ."
"he let her legs slide down his body but kept her warmth flush against his ."
"he enjoyed the softness of her breasts against his chest , her lithe legs which she pressed against his more muscular ones ."
"and the allure of those full , soft lips was more than he could resist ."
"bending low , he took her lips in a soft , tentative kiss , not sure how much control he still had over his raging lust now that she was so willing ."
"his fingers dove into her hair , his hands holding her head still while he kissed her gently , nibbled at her lips , testing her to see if she really wanted this ."
"while downstairs dancing with all the other females that had shown up for the event , his mind had continued to focus on the one woman who did n't want him ."
"correction , he thought as her body shivered in his arms ."
"she did n't want to want him ."
"but her kiss and her body 's reaction was more truthful than her words ."
"so he listened to that instead ."
"malik pulled her harder against his body , his hands sliding up her waist , then down lower , pressing her hips against his ."
"when she wiggled against him , trying to get closer , he lifted her back up into his arms ."
"shanelle thought that the kiss earlier in the night had been a fluke , but as he touched her now , and as she touched him wherever she could reach , she knew that it had n't been ."
"this was real and she could n't pull away from him ."
"nor did she want to !"
"in fact , she wanted to get as close to him as possible , moving her hips against his , feeling the ache build up inside of her and not sure how to appease that almost painful need ."
"everywhere he touched , that need increased until she was crying out for something , not sure exactly what ."
"she grabbed his hand when he started to pull away , pressing his palm against her breast ."
"`` please do that again , '' she begged , not sure where this was coming from , only knowing that she needed his hand right there so badly she thought she might cry if he pulled it away ."
"`` like this ? ''"
"malik asked and his thumb rubbed her already hard , overly sensitive nipple over the thin fabric ."
"shanelle 's head fell backwards as his fingers touched her breast , his palm molding it and pressing it ."
"one of his long fingers slipped inside of her night dress and flicked against her nipple again and her knees almost gave out ."
"the only thing giving them strength was the fact that she could n't let his touch move away from her body ."
"`` again , '' she whispered , her forehead dropping to his shoulder ."
"when he flicked her hard nipple again , she cried out and placed her hand over his ."
"`` no more , '' she begged , but still her body turned , shifting so his fingers had better access ."
"she was n't aware of malik 's fingers on her shoulders , pushing the fabric down her arms ."
"but when the material fell away , she felt the sensations ripping through her and almost screamed with the ache that possessed her ."
"and all of that was before he lifted her into his arms , high enough so that his mouth could cover her nipple ."
"she was n't even aware of her legs wrapping around his waist or the mattress against her back as he laid her down on the bed ."
"all she knew was this man 's tongue could not leave that place against her nipple or she would die ."
"she arched into his mouth , silently begging him to continue ."
"`` more , please ! ''"
"she begged ."
"and he gave in to her command by moving to the other breast , his hands pushing the material down to her waist ."
"her fingers were working themselves ."
"when her hands encountered fabric , she considered it very rude and pushed his dinner jacket off of his shoulders ."
"but still unsatisfied , she almost ripped the buttons off of the expensive material of his shirt , desperate to find out what lay underneath ."
"when her hands encountered his skin , she sighed with happiness ."
"but then his own hands obliterated that satisfaction by moving down her body , sending shock waves as his mouth moved to her other breast , nipping and biting , sucking hard until she screamed out with the pleasure that shot right down to her core , causing the ache to intensify to an almost painful level ."
"`` make it stop , '' she pleaded with him even as her own hands moved down his body , her fingers flexing against the rippling muscles on his flat stomach ."
"malik shook his head slightly , but it did n't help clear the haze of lust that was pulsating through his body ."
"looking down into her eyes , he knew that he could n't stop ."
"not with her writhing like this , her eyes begging him to take her , make love to her ."
"he stood up and ripped off his pants and boxers ."
"and it turned him on even more when she lifted her head to watch him , her eyes wide with fascination as he revealed himself to her ."
"her mouth dropped open with awe and his body hardened even more ."
"malik was in pain , desperately needing to plow himself into her but he held back , wanting to make this first time last ."
"his hands efficiently dispensed with her night gown , smiling when he saw the lace underwear underneath ."
"it occurred to him that she had n't been wearing anything to support her breasts during dinner and he was glad he had n't known that earlier ."
"she 'd been hard enough to resist ."
"and now , he was n't going to any longer ."
"with a desire he 'd never before experienced , malik bent down and kissed his way from her breasts , giving each generous attention , and down to her stomach , laughing when she tried to slip away but his hands grabbed her hips , not letting her try and hide from him ."
"`` open up for me , shanelle , '' he coaxed , raining kisses along her stomach , hips and thighs ."
"`` i do n't ... '' `` trust me , '' he said softly , moving up her body and kissing her once again ."
"she kissed him back with everything she was feeling inside of her , showing him how much she needed him ."
"even while his body moved between her legs , pushing her knees apart so he could nestle between her thighs , exactly where he wanted to be ."
"`` trust me , '' he whispered as he moved from her mouth to her neck , then back down again ."
"when he was right where he wanted to be , shanelle sat up , trying to push his shoulders but he shook his head ."
"`` lay down and enjoy this , shanelle ."
"i 'm not going to stop . ''"
"`` no , '' she countered , trying to scoot back on the mattress ."
"`` this is n't right , '' she said ."
"he laughed and gently bit her finger , then sucked on the end ."
"`` oh , it 's more than right , '' he argued and pressed her shoulders back and moved back to his goal ."
"with his hands holding her down , shanelle could n't move forward or backwards but when his mouth covered her core , she could n't do anything ."
"she could barely even breathe ."
"his mouth was so hot , so delicious and she screamed out when his fingers moved inside of her , pressing , exploring , moving in and out of her all the while , his tongue flicking against the center of her ."
"she wanted to scream out , but she could n't get enough breath in her lungs ."
"she wanted to pull away , but found her hands in his hair , holding him in place ."
"and when her body splintered apart in the most amazing , shocking and mind-blowing climax , she could only lie on the bed and revel in his amazing touch while her body shuddered over and over again ."
"she had no idea how long she lay like that , but she slowly came to the realization that malik was hovering over her , a light in his eyes and a satisfied smile on those talented lips ."
"`` what ? ''"
"she asked , feeling painfully shy all of a sudden ."
"`` you 're beautiful , '' he said ."
"then she felt his hands on her knees , lifting them up so they were resting against his hips ."
"`` but there 's more . ''"
"she started to push him away , positive that she could n't take anything else from him at this point ."
"but then his mouth found her neck and the nibbling there made her body tremble once again ."
"`` i ca n't , '' she gasped and tried to slip away from him ."
"those new and scary feelings were building again and she wanted to run and hide , embarrassed that she 'd so completely let herself go only moments before ."
"`` you can , '' he countered as his hardness probed lower ."
"`` and you will . ''"
"shanelle gasped at the feeling and instantly , it was almost as if she had n't just experienced the most mind blowing feeling of her life ."
"she needed him again , just as intensely ."
"possibly more !"
"`` this is n't possible , '' she said and her hands changed from pushing him away to pulling him where she needed him to be , where that ache was building up to intolerable levels so quickly that it made her bite her lip to try and pretend that it was n't happening ."
"`` it 's very possible , '' he said and moved deeper inside of her , closing his eyes as her tight heat wrapped around him like a tight , hot glove ."
"`` maybe a bit uncomfortable initially , '' he said as he came up against her barrier , `` but definitely possible . ''"
"shanelle closed her eyes and bit her lower lip ."
"this was n't as nice , she thought ."
"`` malik , i do n't want ... this is n't ... '' she was n't sure what to say ."
"the ache was still there , but he was too big ."
"`` you do n't fit ... '' she said but then he pushed all the way inside of her and she arched her back and screamed out with the pain of his invasion ."
"malik held very still , holding himself above her while she adjusted to his size ."
"every muscle inside of him wanted to move , to feel the friction of her body but he waited ."
"he was n't sure what she would do , but he knew that he 'd just hurt her and that hurt him ."
"his hands moved up to her hair , soothing her with soft words and tender caresses while her body shifted underneath his ."
"`` do n't move , '' he commanded with a voice even he did n't recognize ."
"`` i ca n't help it ."
"i do n't underst ... '' she stopped and gasped when he moved slightly and she grabbed his shoulders tightly ."
"`` do n't do that , '' she demanded ."
"but he did and she arched against him once more ."
"`` again , '' she pleaded , moving her hips slightly and shivering with the feeling that movement generated within her ."
"`` do n't stop , '' she ordered when he slowed down ."
"malik thought he might have laughed at her demand , but he was n't sure ."
"all he knew was that her body was gripping him with a heat that he could n't endure for too long ."
"he lifted her up , moving in and out of her with whatever control he could find within him ."
"and when that did n't help her , he shifted his hand and pressed it against her nub , bringing her faster to a climax ."
"she started to grab his hand , but when he obviously hit the right spot , she pressed his hand there and he knew he was doing it right ."
"he could n't believe it when she once again shattered in his arms but he did n't have time to revel in her release because his own just about made him pass out with the intensity of his orgasm ."
"chapter 4 shanelle opened her eyes , looked around and then sat up with a gasp of horror ."
"clutching the satin sheet to her chest , she looked around , her eyes taking in the enormous room , the decadent luxury and the fact that this was not her own room in her own home ."
"as the sun slowly woke her up , her mind remembered the previous night ."
"the previous long , sensuous night ."
"over and over , malik had made love to her ."
"it was almost as if they could n't get enough of each other and every time she touched him or he touched her , their bodies just went up in flames until she collapsed in his arms once again ."
"shifting around , she was relieved to see that she was alone ."
"at least she did n't have an awkward first moment to deal with ."
"she threw the covers off of her legs and dashed into the bathroom to shower ."
"she scrubbed her body clean , trying desperately hard to ignore the tingling as the warm water touched her skin ."
"it reminded her too much of malik 's touch over the long , erotic hours of the night ."
"everything he demanded , she more than willingly complied with his commands ."
"the heady sensation of his fingers and his mouth had been too much for her body to ignore ."
"as she stepped out of the shower , her next dilemma was to figure out what to wear ."
"she had n't anticipated staying here at the palace more than one night so she did n't have any additional clothes with her ."
"she peered into the closet , just to see if there was anything there she might borrow ."
"what she found made her gasp with both surprise and delight ."
"the closet was filled with clothes in her size and with the tags still on every single outfit ."
"she did n't like the idea that someone had gone out and purchased clothes for her yesterday , and was n't really sure that was possible ."
"but she picked up a powder blue dress and found the matching shoes , slipping both on along with the delicate , lacy underthings that were in one of the drawers ."
"feeling better about things now that she was at least dressed , she took a deep breath and opened the door to the suite ."
"`` goodness , what a coincidence , '' her mother said as she was also stepping out of another room ."
"`` we 're just heading to the dining room ."
"we can all go together . ''"
"with that , her mother tucked shanelle 's arm onto her own and they walked down the long hallway ."
"`` where 's father ? ''"
"shanelle asked ."
"`` he had to get back to work ."
"some sort of emergency came up , '' her mother replied ."
"`` so what on earth did you do to gain sheik rahal 's notice ? ''"
"she asked ."
"shanelle really had no idea what had happened that first night and sighed with resignation ."
"`` i was just walking down the hallway , '' she explained ."
"thankfully , they came to the dining room at that moment ."
"it was lovely with elaborate place settings and a delicious smelling buffet set out with steaming dishes and gorgeous fruit ."
"but the only thing that caught her attention was the man standing by the window ."
"her breath caught in her throat and her body seemed to suddenly come alive as malik approached them , his dark eyes never leaving hers , entrapping her with their intensity ."
"he greeted shanelle 's mother first and it gave shanelle a moment to brace herself ."
"unfortunately , nothing could have prepared her for the shock of his touch , the heat that shot through her body and pooled deep in her belly ."
"`` did you sleep well ? ''"
"her breath shuddered as she tried to regain control , but with him touching her , it was n't going to happen ."
"she even tried to pull her hand out of his larger one , but he was n't allowing her that reprieve ."
"`` not very well , '' she finally answered ."
"`` there were a great many disturbances throughout the night . ''"
"she looked up at him , daring him to reply ."
"he laughed softly and led her over to the buffet , handing her a plate ."
"`` i anticipate that your nights are going to be disturbed in the same manner again very soon , '' he said with a knowing look ."
"shanelle should have known not to challenge the man ."
"he was more experienced at this game ."
"she took the plate and looked downwards , putting fruit and toast in the center before moving to the table ."
"she took a seat next to her mother who was already seated and talking with the others that had been invited ."
"there were five other women , all of them beautiful and every one of them preening in an attempt to gain malik 's attention ."
"shanelle looked down at her food and focused only on eating ."
"she allowed the conversation to flow around her , not bothering to participate in any way ."
"she heard malik make several pointed comments in her direction , but she refused to rise to the intentional jibes this time ."
"when she was finished , she stood up and curtsied in his direction ."
"`` if you 'll excuse me , your highness , i know you have important business here , '' she said and left the room without waiting for any response from him , not even giving him time to reply ."
"she was too embarrassed over everything they 'd done the previous night to even look him in the eye ."
"the next week was a blur to shanelle ."
"she could n't seem to get away from malik , although she gave it her best effort ."
"when she snuck into the vast library , intending to lose herself in the books , malik found her and they had a rousing argument about the classics , including who they thought should be in dante 's inferno ."
"she was laughing at some of his ideas ( which included anyone driving slowly in the fast lane of the highway ) ."
"she thought it was amusing that the supreme commander of the country would want others to violate traffic limits ."
"when she tried to sneak into the kitchens , wanting to escape mentally by baking cookies , he turned up and sat across the wooden work table from her , sneaking tastes of whatever she was stirring up ."
"no matter how many times she smacked his hand away , he still managed to grab one more taste ."
"then there was the time she wanted to hide out in the gardens despite the afternoon heat ."
"that was the most disastrous attempt because he pulled her into the shade and kissed her ."
"she 'd tried very hard to resist him ."
"and for perhaps two seconds , her hands pressed against his chest and she refused to kiss him back ."
"his response was to simply sneak his hands underneath her silk blouse and all thought of resisting him went away like the breeze ."
"every day , they dined as a group ."
"the other women vying for his attention and shanelle sneaking out of the dining room before everyone else ."
"every day , she tried to find a different hiding place , some place she would n't be discovered and malik would n't pull her into his arms and kiss her until she was crazy with need ."
"but no matter where she ended up , he was also there ."
"he was charming and interesting , driving her crazy when he challenged her ideas on various subjects ."
"he even helped her study for her law exams , which she thought was the ultimate kindness ."
"until she walked away from him with a silly smile on her face ."
"when she realized that she 'd just spent the better part of four hours studying for a test with the very same man who was going to eliminate the possibility of her taking the test , she became angry ."
"and more confusingly , that anger turned to sadness when she wondered if he was n't going to take away her chance to become a lawyer ."
"why would he help her study , except if he were thinking of marrying one of the other women that were visiting the palace ?"
"that thought caused her such a huge amount of jealousy she actually had to stop and place her hand against the palace wall , trying to catch her breath ."
"this was crazy , she told herself ."
"she could n't keep going on like this ."
"she was angry with him one moment , excited about seeing him another , laughing with him , arguing with him , pushing him to do something she believed in and agreeing with him on something she 'd previously been completely opposed to ."
"what was going on with her ?"
"why was she being so pathetically wishy washy ?"
"she sat down on one of the benches , looking down at the floor ."
"her eyes did n't see the intricate mosaic design , nor did she hear the heavy feet that were coming towards her ."
"she stared at nothing at all , feeling only the panic and confusion over what was happening to her ."
"and all because of a man she 'd met only several days ago ."
"she had to get out of here ."
"her mother and father had left two days ago , she should just follow them ."
"she could pack up her dress , leave all the new clothes behind because they were n't hers anyway , and just head on home ."
"with that in mind , she walked quickly in the opposite direction ."
"when she reached the suite of rooms she 'd been sleeping in , she tore into the closet , unaware of the tears streaming down her cheeks ."
"she grabbed the silver dress she 'd worn here so many nights ago , her mind cringing at how exciting and confusing that night had been ."
"malik had n't come to her room except for that one night , but every day he kissed her until she was melting against him ."
"she did n't want to beg , but she was quickly reaching the point where she would beg him to make love to her again ."
"and she could n't do that ."
"she had to get away , she had to leave the palace ."
"she looked around , not finding any sort of bag to take her dress home in ."
"should she just leave it here ?"
"she looked down at the shimmering material and could n't do it ."
"she had to take it with her ."
"she wanted this dress close to her ."
"she might not want to be married to the man , but that night had been incredibly wonderful and she would keep this dress , perhaps hang it up in the back of her closet and take it out on those lonely nights when she needed to remember the night she met possibly the most exciting man of her life ."
"she pulled open the door to her suite and ran into a brick wall ."
"well , not specifically a brick wall , but a solid force with arms that wrapped around her , hands that steadied her so she did n't fall down ."
"as soon as those strong arms wrapped around her , she knew that malik had come to find her once again ."
"`` what are you doing here ? ''"
"she asked , leaning her head against his chest in both defeat and the need to feel his warmth , smell his delicious scent just one more time ."
"`` i was told that you were crying , '' he said , lifting her up and carrying her into her room ."
"he sat down with her on his lap over by one of the windows ."
"`` tell me what 's bothering you , '' he said , his hands moving along her back ."
"she knew that he was trying to be soothing , but the feel of his hand was obliterating her resolve ."
"all she wanted to do was press her body against his hard one , feel that intense passion spring to life as it always did whenever he touched her ."
"she buried her face in his neck , breathing in his spicy scent ."
"`` i have to go , '' she explained softly ."
"malik stiffened , not sure he 'd heard her correctly ."
"`` why do you need to go ? ''"
"he asked gently ."
"her bottom was pressing against his groin and his body was n't immune to her incredible softness ."
"the bed was too close ."
"he was trying to respect her need for space , for romance ."
"but he wanted her painfully ."
"the other women were just a nuisance to him and he wanted them gone so he could focus all of his attention on her ."
"but if those women made her feel more secure , then he would endure their presence ."
"he would do anything to help her feel comfortable with the future they would share together ."
"`` i just have to get out of here , '' she whispered , but her tears were drying up as she realized where she was ."
"malik stopped moving his hand , his eyes looking down into her own ."
"`` shanelle ? ''"
"he asked softly , without any pressure ."
"she looked up at him , all the longing shining through in her eyes ."
"`` just one more time , '' she whispered and her hand reached up , touching the back of his neck while her fingers slid into his hair ."
"she did n't have to ask him twice ."
"as soon as he realized she was willing to kiss him , he took over the activity , bringing her body closer , shifting her in his lap so that she was facing him ."
"and then it was all over for both of them ."
"he lifted her into his arms , carrying her to the bed while the silver , satin dress slid to the floor , long forgotten ."
"a long time later , shanelle lifted her head up , startled by the heat under her cheek ."
"when she realized that her head was laying against malik 's chest , she gasped and drew back , horrified that she was in bed with him ."
"and they 'd just made love like there was no tomorrow !"
"thankfully , he was asleep and she could feast her eyes on him without questions or worry ."
"when she realized what she was doing , she jumped out of bed , pulling on her clothes as quickly as she could ."
"it was n't easy , since they were scattered around the room , obviously thrown about in the heat of passion ."
"malik was still asleep in her bed but she stopped to kiss him gently before hurrying out of the suite ."
"she practically skidded to a halt when she exited and came face to face with his body guards , all of whom were standing at attention outside her door ."
"of course they were there , she chided herself for being startled ."
"they followed malik all over , even inside the palace ."
"she did n't understand what was going on , but she was still determined to get out of here ."
"with a small , embarrassed smile , she hurried down the hallway ."
"she was n't sure how to get out of the palace , not even sure if the guards would allow her to leave ."
"but when she glanced to her right , she saw several of the servants walking quickly down one of the hallways ."
"with a flash of irony , she followed them ."
"since the servants ' hallways had gotten her into this mess , surly they could get her out of it !"
"she walked down the hallway , acting as if she belonged and there was nothing odd about a guest of the palace walking down the servants ' hallways towards the kitchens ."
"she knew her way around the palace somewhat after being here for almost a week , but she did n't think she 'd ever learn the whole map of the building ."
"it was too vast , to winding and with centuries of leaders adding onto the structure , both inside and out , there were hallways and tunnels that had probably been forgotten about ."
"she was almost to the kitchens , intending to slip out with the afternoon shift change when a strong arm circled her waist ."
"she was hauled up against the wall , her back pressing against the marble while her breasts were plastered against malik 's equally hard chest ."
"`` what the hell do you think you 're doing ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"shanelle was too emotional by this point ."
"she 'd gone through too many confusing thoughts over the past several hours , all of which were centered on this man ."
"`` just let me go , '' she cried out , her small fists punching his chest , trying to get some space from him ."
"she needed to run , to hide and just find herself once again ."
"`` i ca n't do this !"
"i do n't even like you ! ''"
"she sobbed ."
"malik took her hands in his , holding them firmly over her head while his body continued to press against her , holding her hostage ."
"`` you 're not going anywhere , shanelle ."
"you 're just too afraid to admit that you 're in love with me ."
"but running away wo n't solve your problem . ''"
"he was furious with her for not realizing the truth , furious with himself as well for not realizing that she was so scared ."
"he 'd tiptoed around their feelings , their future and he 'd almost lost her ."
"if his guards had n't stepped into her suite right after she 'd left , just five more minutes , and she might have left the palace ."
"all because she was too stubborn and confused to deal with their feelings for each other ."
"`` i love you , damn it !"
"so get a grip and stop fighting this ! ''"
"she froze , her eyes wide with his words ."
"`` you love me ? ''"
"she asked in a small voice ."
"`` of course i love you ."
"i 've loved you since that first night when you yelled at me for being in the wrong place ! ''"
"she laughed , but it sounded more like a hiccup ."
"`` then why do you have all those other women here ? ''"
"she demanded , her tone rising once again ."
"malik rolled his eyes ."
"`` because you told me to invite others here !"
"are you telling me that this is all because you 're jealous ? ''"
"`` absolutely not ! ''"
"she gasped ."
"`` i was under the impression that you were still too nervous about venturing into a relationship with me ."
"what 's this all about , shanelle ? ''"
"he demanded ."
"`` explain this to me so i can understand . ''"
"she sniffed and looked up at the ceiling ."
"`` i do n't want to marry you ! ''"
"`` you love me ! ''"
"he came right back ."
"she shrugged ."
"`` maybe , but that 's not really the point , is it ? ''"
"he sighed , letting her hands drop down to her waist but he did n't release her ."
"`` shanelle , if love between a husband and wife is n't the issue , please tell me what is . ''"
"he leaned down , placing his forehead against hers ."
"`` what 's the problem here ? ''"
"she pushed away from him , irritated that he was fixing everything she was worried about ."
"`` i do n't love you and you do n't love me ."
"it takes months of knowing someone before we can really love each other ."
"but you do n't have time for that !"
"you 're in some silly , crazy rush to get married and i 'm just some convenient woman who just happens to be sexually compatible with you . ''"
"he growled and pulled her against him , showing her physically what she did to his body ."
"`` we 're more than just sexually compatible , shanelle ."
"and do n't you dare tell me what i feel for you ."
"nor will i allow you to deny your feelings for me ."
"it might take some people months , but we both knew how we felt almost instantly . ''"
"shanelle thought about denying it one more time , but what was the point ?"
"she did love him ."
"she did n't understand that love , but it was there every time they spoke to one another ."
"and when they kissed ... yes , it was there in his kisses , in the way he touched her ."
"`` okay then , i ca n't do it ."
"i do n't want to give up my whole life , my career . ''"
"`` why would you need to give up anything ?"
"i thought you wanted to be a lawyer . ''"
"she looked up at him , furious for being so obtuse ."
"`` i do want to be a lawyer ."
"i want to help people and make their lives better by fighting for them ."
"i want the bad guys to go to jail and the good guys to win ."
"how am i supposed to do that when i 'm your wife ? ''"
"malik rolled his eyes , suddenly understanding more about her ."
"and now that he understood the big issue , he was just that much more in love with her ."
"`` shanelle , do you hear what you 're saying ?"
"you want to help the people who are helpless ."
"what better way to do that than to help me rule kanaan ?"
"there are so many people out there who need our help ."
"the big guys and the little guys ."
"and the little women and children ."
"you can help shape the laws , ensure that they are enforced ."
"as my wife , you and i are in the best position to bring about change in so many areas . ''"
"shanelle listened to his words and wondered if it were true ."
"`` will you truly listen to me when i disagree ? ''"
"she asked , doubt filling her voice ."
"he chuckled and pulled her back into his arms ."
"`` is n't that what you 've already started doing this week ?"
"we 've had some pretty intense arguments . ''"
"`` yes , but they 've all been good spirited . ''"
"`` are you saying that we 'll genuinely fight about issues in the future ? ''"
"he asked with amusement ."
"`` yes , '' she replied ."
"`` i can guarantee that i wo n't agree with everything you say . ''"
"he laughed and rolled his eyes ."
"`` i know that ."
"i 've already experienced your disagreement ."
"and it was n't too bad . ''"
"she laughed as well ."
"`` oh , you think you 're getting off that easily ? ''"
"she asked ."
"he lifted her up into his arms and kissed her ."
"`` does this mean you 're going to stop pushing me away and we can announce our engagement ? ''"
"he asked , but he did n't give her a chance to answer him ."
"instead , his mouth covered hers and he kissed her until she was clinging to him , her body on fire for whatever he had in mind ."
"`` would i be able to stop you ? '"
"she asked saucily ."
"he chuckled ."
"`` probably not ."
"but i guess i 'll have to take you to bed until the wedding , just to make sure you do n't try and sneak out . ''"
"she lifted her arms and wrapped them around his neck , smiling with secret invitation ."
"`` i think that would be a very good idea ."
"i can be very sneaky . ''"
"`` hmm ... '' he said ."
"a moment later , he lifted her up , tossing her over his shoulder as he carried her back down the hallway ."
"shanelle knew she should be horrified that he was treating her so abominably , but since he was heading right back to her suite , she did n't really care ."
"she was in love and she was thrilled with the future ."
"for the first time in a long time , she was genuinely excited about what was to come ."
"chapter 1 information ."
"it was arguably more powerful than money , nikolai thought as he put the report down on the desk , his fingers forming a pyramid as he considered the data he had just received ."
"a sense of triumph filled nikolai ."
"his midnight blue eyes looked away from the words and out to the stunning view of the sun rising over the buildings of london , enjoying the feeling of conquest as it washed over him ."
"patience had always been his best asset , he thought ."
"and now , revenge would be sweet ."
"tabitha maccomber would beg for mercy ."
"the only question was whether nik would allow it ."
"his mind remembered her smiling , green eyes , her flawless , porcelain skin and a body any man would happily die to possess ."
"of course , hidden behind that stunningly beautiful facade was a cunning and mercenary nature that had blindsided him four years ago ."
"nikolai andretti smiled coldly as he looked back down at the business section of the newspaper ."
"it was not a smile of amusement although it was filled with deep satisfaction ."
"his eyes quickly scanned down the list of stock prices ."
"when he found the line he was looking for , he raised one eyebrow and mentally did some calculations ."
"he had waited patiently for this situation to come about and now that victory was almost his , he wanted to savor the feeling , let it slide down like a woman 's tender caress ."
"it had actually taken less time than he 'd anticipated but the keenness of victory was no less satisfying for the speed with which her downfall had come ."
"setting the delicate china cup filled with fragrant coffee down on the white linen table cloth , he reflected on how the world seemed to right itself , provide opportunities ."
"with a deep sense of amusement and irony , he leaned back in the leather chair and considered his options ."
"because of the mess she was currently in , there were several possibilities open to him , and all would end in the same way ."
"he just had to choose the most effective ."
"he would have to conduct the transactions discreetly , he knew ."
"no one could know about the stock purchases until he was ready to reveal his hand ."
"quickly analyzing the options and calculating the costs as well as the risks associated with each scenario , he made a decision ."
"raising the phone , he gave curt instructions to his personal assistant , then ended the call abruptly , knowing his assistant would be able to fill in the blanks accurately ."
"standing up , he looked out one of the floor to ceiling windows that made up three walls of his office ."
"being on the thirty-ninth floor , he had an extraordinary view of london ."
"today though , he saw nothing of the striking horizon as the sun rose over the vast city ."
"his mind 's eye was remembering the perfect beauty of tabitha maccomber , her startling blue eyes , her tiny waist that flared gently out to slender hips , ending in long legs that a man could fantasize about forever ."
"the lying , deceitful bitch that still occasionally haunted his dreams would finally be exorcised from his mind ."
"he wanted her ."
"after seeing her smiling face in the report , he had to accept that reality ."
"tabitha maccomber was incredibly lovely but also the only woman who had tricked him so completely , gotten under his skin and then made a fool of him ."
"nikolai considered himself extremely experienced when it came to women specifically and people in general ."
"he knew most of their tricks and thought they were amusing at times ."
"but tabitha had duped him ."
"her air of sweetness and fragility , innocence , had definitely deceived him ."
"but now it was his turn to hold the reins ."
"he would have her , on his terms , on his turf , for as long as he wanted her ."
"and there would be nothing she could do to stop him this time ."
"chapter 2 `` good morning , nancy , '' tabitha maccomber said , smiling brightly at the woman sitting just outside the executive board room ."
"tabitha instantly noted the worried look in the other woman 's soft , brown eyes ."
"`` are you feeling okay ? ''"
"she asked with curiosity ."
"nancy had been the receptionist at maccomber industries for longer than tabitha was alive and she was always cheerful and ready with a smile ."
"nancy nodded , but the anxiety stayed in her eyes ."
"`` i 'm fine , ms ."
"maccomber . ''"
"tabitha could see that the woman was nervous but had no idea why ."
"she made a mental note to stop by and talk with her , find out if there was something genuinely wrong ."
"maybe there were problems with her daughter 's first pregnancy ."
"at the moment , tabitha was running a few minutes late so she pushed through the double oak doors that had stood guard outside the board room of maccomber industries for the last hundred years ."
"the silence that greeted her as she breezed through the door almost made her steps falter , but she continued down the long room to the opposite end of the table , pasting a bright smile onto her face ."
"`` gentlemen , '' she said to the fourteen grim-looking men who were already seated at the polished oak conference table ."
"the fact that they were all seated at the appointed meeting time was unprecedented ."
"`` what an extraordinary event to be starting on time ! ''"
"she joked ."
"when she received no response , she quickly placed her pink purse under the table and opened the leather notebook expectantly ."
"`` is something wrong ? ''"
"she asked , looking at all the faces ."
"`` i ca n't imagine why everyone is so tense , '' she started to say and tucked a blond curl back behind her ear ."
"`` after all , the stock price is finally creeping back up ."
"that 's good news as far as i can tell , '' she said , smiling cheerfully at the rest of the table ."
"again , no response ."
"only forbidding faces looking down at their notebooks ."
"`` charlie , '' she said , turning to grin gaily at a man mid way down the table ."
"`` why are you looking so glum ?"
"you should be celebrating ."
"did n't your son just marry melody miller down in australia ?"
"you should be thrilled ."
"what a match ! ''"
"she said , hiding her abhorrence for society marriages ."
"she knew these men lived and died for them ."
"she shivered in revulsion but pushed the memory aside ."
"when she only received a tense smile from charlie , she turned to another man who was sitting closer ."
"`` mark , did n't you just receive news of grandchild number five ?"
"that 's wonderful to hear ! ''"
"she enthused ."
"mark nodded and she received a brief glimpse of a smile , but it quickly faded ."
"the tension was odd and she wished she could figure out what happened ."
"`` okay , i give up , '' she laughed ."
"`` does someone want to enlighten me as to why it seems that the sky is falling ? ''"
"nelson cleared his throat and sat forward ."
"nelson miller was the current chief operating officer of maccomber industries and a sweet , if somewhat hesitant man in his early forties ."
"she noticed him glance behind her momentarily and hesitate but she focused all of her attention on the man , knowing that there was only a landscape painting on the wall behind her ."
"`` it 's like this , tabitha , '' he started , his fingers nervously swiping at the lock of hair that had fallen free of its usually perfect setting ."
"`` you remember how we invested in that factory in dorset ? ''"
"he started off ."
"`` of course , '' she smiled ."
"`` are you telling me that i was wrong ?"
"that the factory has actually started to show a profit ?"
"because if that 's true , i think i owe you a very large apology , '' she said , smiling encouragingly at him ."
"`` i did n't think that plan would work and it was a large amount of money to throw at a risky scheme . ''"
"nelson leaned forward , his face turning red all of a sudden ."
"`` now see here , '' he started off , huffing slightly in his anger , `` it would have worked ."
"there were just some complications . ''"
"he glanced behind her again , then down at his paper ."
"`` the distribution venues just were n't adequate for our needs , '' he explained ."
"`` and there was poor management that we were n't aware of . ''"
"tabitha smothered a spark of anger ."
"`` i thought you said that you 'd met with the management of the factory and they were quite adequate , '' she countered , maintaining her smile despite her frustrations ."
"`` well , the deal was about to close and i did n't ... . ''"
"he trailed off , leaving the sentence unfinished ."
"tabitha 's eyes sharpened and she had to struggle to not show her irritation at the man ."
"`` you mean you did n't even speak to the management of the factory ?"
"nelson , do you think that was wise ?"
"i even offered to go out there and talk with them before the purchase deadline . ''"
"nelson stood up and banged his fist on the table ."
"`` you are a woman , '' he yelled angrily ."
"`` you could n't possibly have the skills necessary to judge a man 's character and tell if he is an adequate manager . ''"
"tabitha bowed her head , realizing that their sexist attitudes were welling up ."
"some of the other men were actually nodding , their frowns deepening and she had to grit her teeth ."
"`` well , then ."
"from what i 'm gathering as i read between the lines , the purchase of that particular factory was a mistake ."
"am i correct ? ''"
"she asked , looking around the table at the gentlemen ."
"many of them looked away ."
"some pushed their pens or papers around ."
"but none of them acknowledged her question ."
"`` i think i was the one that was cautioning against this purchase , '' she said evenly , shuddering at the cost of the factory and wondering what kind of financial impact this setback would have on the company ."
"`` okay ."
"we made a mistake , '' she said , including herself in that decision ."
"she had n't argued loudly enough against the issue so she was part of the problem ."
"`` what do we have to do to clean it up ? ''"
"she asked to the group of men ."
"when none of them answered , she glanced to the other side of the table ."
"`` george , what do you think ?"
"how soon can we sell off the factory and recoup our losses ? ''"
"she asked ."
"nelson shook his head ."
"`` you 're out of your league , tabitha ."
"why do n't you run off and go shopping and let us handle this situation ? ''"
"he said , his tone patronizing ."
"`` i 'll even take you out for dinner once the dust has settled . ''"
"tabitha gripped her pen until her knuckles were white , struggling to hold her temper ."
"she ignored his offer of dinner and continued , `` well , it looks like we 're all in a bit of a pickle , would n't you say ?"
"and i doubt sending me on a shopping trip is going to solve that problem ."
"do any of you ? ''"
"she asked , looking at each of the elderly men , disheartened to know now what they actually thought about her ."
"the chuckle behind her was terrifying in its familiarity and an electric shock went through her body ."
"it could n't be , she told herself ."
"her breath caught in her throat and her blood seemed to freeze in her veins as her mind recognized the voice behind that laughter ."
"even her body understood who was behind her although her mind still refused to believe what every cell was telling her ."
"it simply could n't be him ."
"she turned bit by bit , the world moving in slow motion as she swiveled in her leather chair to face the owner of the deep voice ."
"praying that it was n't so , her eyes widening as she took in the man leaning casually against the wall ."
"`` you ! ''"
"she spat out , her whole mind instantly forgetting about the fourteen men seated around the table as her world focused on the man that had been behind her for the past fifteen minutes ."
"nikolai andretti !"
"`` what are you doing here ! ''"
"she demanded , standing up in an effort to gain some height and lose some of the fear that was quickly spreading throughout her body , freezing her mind ."
"how could this man make her instantly feel something so strong ?"
"it had been four years !"
"could n't the impact of his presence dim somewhat ?"
"he did n't rise to her angry challenge , one eyebrow rising slightly the only indication that he had heard her question ."
"he did n't even bother to stand up , but continued to lean casually against the wall , appearing as if this whole mess was highly amusing to him ."
"`` good morning , tabitha ."
"i see the heart grows fonder with time , does it not ? ''"
"he asked sardonically ."
"tabitha 's whole body started shaking as she took in the presence of the man that could evoke so many memories , so many painful , dreadful and yet also beautiful memories for her ."
"she pushed those thoughts and feelings aside and squared her shoulders ."
"`` i 'm not sure who invited you here but it is completely inappropriate ."
"this is a board meeting and only board members and large stock holders are permitted , '' she stated slowly , afraid that her voice might fail if she did n't concentrate on each syllable ."
"her stomach muscles tightened as his sensuous mouth eased into a triumphant smile ."
"his midnight blue eyes darkened to black ."
"`` ah , pethia meu , '' he said , pushing away from the wall and walking toward her ."
"he was so tall , tabitha had to push her head back in order to continue to hold his gaze ."
"`` as you so aptly put it a few moments ago , the stock price has gone up considerably ."
"have you not stopped to consider how that occurred ? ''"
"tabitha opened her mouth , her mind frantically working to come up with a plausible explanation ."
"`` i assumed it was the factory coming on line . ''"
"his smile was lethal ."
"`` and now that you know that the factory has not come on line as expected , is in fact bringing your company into bankruptcy , what would be your next guess ? ''"
"tabitha thought hard , wishing she could come up with some other reason ."
"frantically working through all the scenarios , she came to the final , and worst , possibility ."
"her eyes snapping to his in disbelief and horror ."
"`` no ! ''"
"she whispered ."
"nikolai smiled again , his sexy mouth curving in triumphant pleasure ."
"`` i see you 've finally come to the correct conclusion , '' he said with a great deal of gratification ."
"`` that 's impossible ! ''"
"she countered ."
"`` all of these men own stock and , combined , they have a controlling interest ."
"there 's no way you could be a stock holder with any kind of power in this company . ''"
"nik looked around at the men , none of whom were willing to hold his gaze ."
"`` i 'm afraid you have put your trust into the wrong source , '' he said softly ."
"`` again . ''"
"he let those words float in the air for a long moment before continuing ."
"`` each of these men were more than willing to sell their stock in your precious company ."
"i now own fifty five percent of the stock ."
"it is mine to do with as i please , '' he said , his eyes hard and brilliant with the success of his acquisition ."
"tabitha pulled back , her hatred for this man and all he knew about her was too painful to endure ."
"`` why on earth would you bother with a company so small ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"`` you 're reputation is that you take over billion dollar companies ."
"what is the appeal of maccomber industries ?"
"do n't you have bigger fish to gobble up mercilessly ? ''"
"she demanded ."
"`` our revenue is only in the millions ."
"we employ less than five hundred people ."
"i would have thought we were beneath your notice , '' she said , knowing that he could buy and sell maccomber industries a hundred times over and never even blink at the impact to his personal bank balance ."
"he shrugged his shoulders slightly ."
"`` when an opportunity arrives , i jump at it , '' he said coolly ."
"it was hard for her to believe anyone could be so casual about an amount of money that , to her , was enormous ."
"but she knew that to him , it was almost insignificant ."
"`` an opportunity for what ? ''"
"she asked breathlessly ."
"`` this is nothing but petty vindictiveness and i 'm not going to let you get away with it . ''"
"nikolai surveyed her flushed , angry expression without any outward reaction ."
"`` perhaps this is a conversation we should have in private , '' he said softly ."
"`` do n't bother with niceties , '' she replied ."
"`` i have nothing to say to you . ''"
"she crossed her arms over her chest , her chin going up a notch in challenge ."
"without another word , he looked down the board room table at the men behind her ."
"instantly , fourteen elderly men stood up and hurried out of the board room ."
"within thirty seconds , all of them had disappeared , closing the door softly and leaving tabitha alone with the one man in the world she hated ."
"`` what were you saying ? ''"
"he asked once they were alone ."
"her arms dropped in defeat and she could n't look up at him ."
"`` you have a photographic memory , '' she snapped , turning her back on him in a defensive gesture ."
"`` you remember exactly what the accusation was , '' she said and took several steps away , afraid to let him see her expression ."
"nikolai smiled and nodded ."
"`` yes ."
"in fact , you are right , '' he said , his greek accent coming through as his amusement surfaced ."
"`` revenge , '' he said simply ."
"she spun back around to face him , her eyes searching his dark , mysterious eyes in the hopes that he was joking ."
"the blood actually chilled in her veins when she realized that he was n't ."
"her worst fears had come true ."
"nikolai being here was bad enough ."
"but that he wanted revenge that was awful ."
"terrifying !"
"`` and what if i told you that revenge has already been had ? ''"
"she asked , the fear coming through to her voice in the form of a slight break despite her efforts to appear calm and in control of this horrifying situation ."
"nikolai shook his head ."
"`` ah , my dear tabitha ."
"i do n't think you know the meaning of the word , '' he said , one hand coming up to run a finger down the soft , creamy texture of her skin ."
"`` but i intend to remedy that , '' he explained ."
"she pulled her face away , desperate to end the touch that , even after so many years , could still heat her body ."
"she was ashamed of her reaction and could n't hide the anger from him ."
"`` no ! ''"
"he pulled back abruptly and dropped his hand ."
"`` in fact , yes . ''"
"he moved away and poured her a glass of icy water from a side table , handing her the glass ."
"tabitha took it with shaking fingers , unaware of how he could have read her mind so accurately ."
"drinking the water quickly , she placed the empty glass behind her on the oak table ."
"`` what are you telling me ? ''"
"his smile broadened ."
"`` i 'm telling you that we have some unfinished business ."
"i intend to close out that brief period in our lives ."
"but this time , we will have a more satisfying end ."
"and we will do it on my terms , '' he said ."
"she shivered , the memories of how they had parted coming back to her conscious mind ."
"he chuckled ."
"`` i can see that you are thinking about the same memory as i am . ''"
"`` no , '' she said , rubbing her forehead in frustration and an overwhelming need to find a place to hide , perhaps start the day over again with a less horrifying beginning ."
"`` i do n't know what you are talking about . ''"
"his eyes sharpened , reminding her of painful shards of glass ."
"`` then let me enlighten you , '' he started and moved closer so there was barely an inch of space between their bodies ."
"`` that last night we shared together , you were all hot and heavy for me , willing to do anything , just as into the moment as i was ."
"then you stopped , claiming modesty and virtue , something we both know you have neither of ! ''"
"he said calmly , but with venom in his eyes ."
"`` since you decided to go off and marry someone else , i was left hanging . ''"
"`` i wo n't believe you were alone for long ! ''"
"she spat at him , the pain of her last phone call to him hitting her with painful clarity ."
"`` if in fact , were you ever waiting on me to come to your bed ? ''"
"she asked , stepping back so she could breath ."
"`` i 'm guessing there were many women already clamoring for your pathetic brand of romance . ''"
"she walked away from the table , needing space away from his body so she could breathe ."
"nikolai followed her , not giving her any room to think , cornering her against the wall ."
"his dark eyes revealed nothing as he said , `` ah , no , my sweet tabitha ."
"there is no retreat for you ."
"let me explain exactly what is going to happen ."
"we 're going to make love , you and i ."
"over and over again ."
"until i have had my fill of you ."
"and this time , there will be no teasing , '' he said harshly ."
"`` i will have you whenever and however i want . ''"
"her body reacted strongly but not in the way she wished ."
"her mind was remembering the exquisitely beautiful kisses they had shared four years ago and her body ached to experience that kind of magic again ."
"shaking her head to rid herself of those ridiculous fantasies , she turned away from him , not wanting to look at the man who had destroyed her dreams all those years ago ."
"`` that 's not possible , '' she said , her voice low and pained ."
"his smile was a combination of triumph and male arrogance as he said , `` it will still be your choice . ''"
"`` then my choice is no ."
"adamantly no ! ''"
"she shot back at him ."
"he chuckled at her vehemence ."
"`` perhaps you should hear the terms before making your decision . ''"
"`` there 's nothing you can say that will convince me to sleep with you , '' she said angrily ."
"he reached up and touched her shoulder length , brown , curly hair , capturing a lock between his fingers and rubbing the silken strands , testing their softness ."
"`` since sleeping will be the last thing on my mind when we get to my bed , i will agree with you on that point , '' he said evenly ."
"`` you 're disgusting ! ''"
"she said and pulled her hair out of his fingers ."
"`` leave me alone ! ''"
"he pulled back and walked away , straightening the cuffs on his snowy white shirt ."
"`` very well ."
"i 'll start the sales proceedings immediately . ''"
"those words chilled her to the bone ."
"`` wh ... what are you talking about ? ''"
"she asked , straightening now that he was n't standing over her , trying to intimidate her ."
"his eyes were cold and hard as he looked across the expanse of the conference room at her ."
"`` i 'll sell off every piece of this company , starting with the headquarters ."
"all of these people will be out of a job by the end of this month . ''"
"he flicked a glance across the room and started walking toward the doors ."
"tabitha did n't think that things could get worse , but his words proved her wrong ."
"`` are you kidding ? ''"
"she asked , moving quickly to stand in front of him , blocking the double door exit ."
"his smile was merciless ."
"`` have i ever joked about anything ?"
"especially something this serious ? ''"
"tabitha shook her head slowly ."
"`` no , '' she finally said through a painfully tight throat ."
"`` i can assure you that i have not started at this juncture in my life ."
"business is business , '' he said simply , shrugging his shoulders ."
"`` you 're reducing sex down to a business arrangement ?"
"and you 'll put over five hundred people out of work simply because i wo n't sleep with you ? ''"
"her shock was making her mind work slowly ."
"she just could n't fathom anyone so heartless ."
"`` absolutely , '' he said without remorse ."
"`` i 've found that most liaisons are basically a business arrangement ."
"women always want something ; a trinket , a vacation , or their picture in the paper , connecting their name to mine . ''"
"his voice softened slightly when he added , `` but i can also guarantee that none of them leave my bed unsatisfied ."
"i take great pleasure in ensuring each of my companions leave with a smile . ''"
"`` stop it , '' she said , covering her ears with her hands ."
"`` i do n't want to hear these things !"
"leave all those other women out of this conversation ."
"if you hate me so much , why in the world would you do this to me ?"
"why would you spend millions of dollars buying controlling stock in this company ? ''"
"his eyes traveled down her body and she was ashamed when her nipples peaked under his knowing look ."
"she hated that her body reacted , willing her trembling anticipation to go away ."
"`` there are some things the mind ignores when it comes to pleasures of the flesh ."
"i saw your picture in the paper last month and realized that i still wanted you ."
"therefore , i have found a way to have you ."
"it 's all in your hands . ''"
"his dark blue eyes glittered moments before he said , `` example in point , '' and without any further warning , his strong , muscular arms pulled her against his body , one arm wrapping around her waist while his other hand came up to tangle in her curls , bringing her head up only a moment before his mouth covered hers ."
"he took advantage of her gasp , his tongue moving in to her mouth and mating with hers ."
"tabitha was stunned and her mind stopped working as her body took over ."
"she reacted without thought to his kiss , her body glorying in the amazing feel of his hands , his lips and his tongue as he showed her again how wonderful and skilled he was as a lover ."
"she was unaware of the soft moans that escaped her as his mouth caressed hers , his hard body molding against her softer one ."
"he pulled free suddenly and looked down at her for a long moment , noting with satisfaction the stunned expression in her soft , blue eyes ."
"`` you have twenty-four hours to contact me ."
"if i do n't hear from you , the auction begins tomorrow at noon , '' he said and flipped a business card from a pocket , handing it to her ."
"a moment later , he was gone , leaving tabitha staring at the expensive velum business card , her whole body trembling in reaction to both his kiss and his ultimatum ."
"chapter 3 that evening , sitting in the big house her father had left to her , she cooked her lonely dinner but could n't swallow any of it ."
"the tears she 'd been holding at bay all day slowly fell , eventually tapering off as she stared out at the black window ."
"she did n't see anything though ."
"her mind was moving back to that fateful meeting ."
"she 'd been standing at the train station waiting for her father to pick her up ."
"she had only just returned home from finishing school and was looking forward to a relaxing summer before she started to look for some sort of employment ."
"she hoped her father would allow her to work in the company , but knew he was pretty old fashioned and did n't think women should work ."
"marriage was probably what he was hoping for , but she was confident enough that she could convince him otherwise ."
"she heard the motorcycle before she could see it ."
"the flashy red zoomed around the curve , then came to a quick halt as the rider looked around ."
"when his eyes lit on her , the helmet lifted and dark , penetrating eyes looked her up and down ."
"`` good afternoon , '' his deep voice said ."
"tabitha looked around nervously ."
"the train station was on the outskirts of town , surrounded on three sides with trees ."
"it was relatively isolated , but she saw several pedestrians walking along a side street which assured her that she was n't completely alone ."
"`` good afternoon , '' she replied , smiling politely even though the man 's tight denims and leather jacket showed her that he was absolutely gorgeous ."
"`` would you be able to tell me how to get to burnham street ? ''"
"he asked , pulling a map out of a small glove compartment of his motorcycle ."
"having lived in the small town all her life , tabitha was very aware of how the streets intersected and changed names several times ."
"if one did n't know the streets , it was easy to become turned around ."
"`` of course , '' she said , stepping forward to the edge of the platform and raised her arm to point over at the right ."
"`` if you go down that street , then turn left again , you 'll be on burnham street . ''"
"she paused before continuing , `` why do you want burnham street ? ''"
"she asked ."
"the man 's sexy smile made her stomach flip flop and her heart beat accelerate ."
"`` i have a meeting with someone at one , '' he explained ."
"`` do you need a lift ? ''"
"he asked ."
"tabitha blushed for some reason but shook her head ."
"`` no , thank you ."
"my father will be along soon ."
"but thank you for the offer ."
"i do n't want to make you late for your meeting . ''"
"the audacious man winked at her , then put his helmet back on ."
"revving the engine to his motorcycle , he waved back to her before speeding off in the direction she 'd given him ."
"tabitha smiled , her mind instantly forming a romantic scene where he carried her off on his motorcycle to his country cabin and the two of them fell madly in love ."
"she shook her head , pushing the silly fantasy aside , then picked up her book and sat down on the bench to wait for her father ."
"it was a lovely spring afternoon and she did n't mind sitting out in the sun for the few minutes while she waited , sure that her father would be along any moment ."
"next thing she knew , the motor cycle was buzzing right back up the street ."
"tabitha looked at her watch and gasped ."
"over an hour had passed but she 'd been so absorbed in her mystery book that she had n't even noticed that her father had obviously forgotten about her ."
"`` hello again , '' the man said , pulling up along side the train station and setting up the kick stand before taking off his helmet again ."
"`` looks like your ride did n't come along ."
"how about if we put your luggage in a storage locker and i get you a cup of coffee ? ''"
"by the time he finished his suggestion , he was already standing up on the platform , his long legs carrying him quickly so he was standing in front of her as he stared down into her embarrassed face ."
"`` i think you 're quite right , '' she said , looking down the road again as if her father 's car would suddenly appear ."
"`` i guess he must have forgotten . ''"
"`` he ? ''"
"the man asked ."
"tabitha flushed , realizing the unspoken question ."
"`` my father . ''"
"`` ah ."
"good , '' he replied ."
"`` you ca n't stay here on the train platform indefinitely ."
"it does n't look like you have a phone and it 's getting late ."
"i 'm sure this is a very nice town but it probably is n't safe for you out here alone . ''"
"he leaned down slightly and said in a teasing , conspiratorial tone , `` i promise i 'm a very trustworthy fellow ."
"so how about that coffee ? ''"
"tabitha looked down at her skirt , then back up at his gorgeous face ."
"`` i do n't think i 'm appropriately dressed to ride with you , '' she said , the disappointment written on her face ."
"he leaned forward again and winked at her ."
"`` i promise not to look if you pull your skirt up , '' he said , reading her mind ."
"tabitha could only laugh at his wit but she was thrilled someone as handsome as he was willing to pass the time of day with her ."
"`` deal , '' she replied , feeling daring and naughty but extremely pretty with his sexy eyes daring her to come with him ."
"he did n't reply , simply smiled again and picked up her heavy suitcases effortlessly , storing them in one of the large lockers , locking it and handing her the key ."
"true to his word , he got onto the motorcycle and stared straight ahead while she climbed onto the back , handing her the only helmet ."
"`` by the way , my name 's nikolai , '' he said , turning his head slightly so the sound traveled her way ."
"`` i 'm tabitha , '' she replied ."
"tabitha timidly put her hands on his shoulders as he started the engine ."
"`` you 're going to have to hold on a lot tighter than that if you do n't want to fall off the back , '' he warned only moments before accelerating wildly ."
"tabitha grabbed his waist and locked her legs around his hips , terrified of the alternative ."
"she did n't mind hugging this man though , a dangerous thrill going through her as he moved through the village streets to a coffee shop ."
"she noticed that he passed several establishments that also served coffee , only stopping at the one on the opposite side of town ."
"once they were seated inside with their coffee , he asked her questions about her life , about her school and what her plans for the future were ."
"tabitha answered him , feeling special as this man , who was much older than the usual boys her father arranged to accompany her to different events , talked to her , got her to open up more than she 'd ever spoken to another human being ."
"the afternoon was fading into evening when she reluctantly admitted that she needed to get home ."
"he drove her to her house , but would n't release her until she promised to meet him the next day for lunch ."
"she gladly accepted , feeling her heart race in anticipation ."
"`` wear pants tomorrow ."
"i make no promises on my gentlemanly behavior if you wear a skirt again , '' he said , smiling that wicked smile at her again before zooming off down the road ."
"that night , she dreamed about nickolai and his amazing smile , her mind wondering what his kiss would be like ."
"she wanted to experience the touch of his lips and feel his body ."
"she blushed in the darkness of her room , terrified that someone might hear her thoughts and admonish her for being so brazen ."
"her father smiled at her in the morning as she came down to breakfast , an apology in his eyes as he poured her tea ."
"`` i 'm terribly sorry about yesterday , tabby , '' he said , handing her the sugar for her tea ."
"`` i completely forgot ."
"meetings , you know , '' he said and kissed her on the cheek ."
"`` how about if i ask susan to make a special dinner tonight to celebrate your return , '' he said as he stood up , preparing to head off to work ."
"`` that sounds lovely , '' she said , smiling up at him ."
"she knew he had a lot on his mind ."
"it had been like this all her life and she 'd accepted that he was a very busy man ."
"he was also the wealthiest in the village and had a reputation to uphold ."
"the morning went by slowly but she was thrilled when she heard the motorcycle coming up the drive ."
"bouncing down the stairs , she was already on the front porch when he stopped ."
"`` hello , bella , '' he said , his eyes moving over her brown , curling hair that she 'd left down today ."
"`` you look ravishing , '' he said as he handed her a second helmet , putting it gently on her head himself ."
"she shivered when his hands touched her chin , connecting the strap ."
"`` are you hungry ? ''"
"he asked , smiling that million dollar smile ."
"`` starving , '' she said breathlessly ."
"`` good , '' he chuckled ."
"`` so am i , '' he replied ."
"`` come along . ''"
"he drove them to a pretty spot in the country , on top of a hill that looked down on the village ."
"tabitha had never known this place was here and she wondered how someone who had been in the village for only one day had found the prettiest spot available ."
"`` this is lovely , '' she said , taking the blanket he handed her and spreading it out over the grass ."
"`` how on earth did you discover it ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` i was riding by yesterday and saw it ."
"i 'm glad you like it , '' he said and placed a large picnic basket down in the middle of the blanket that had been tied to the back of his bike ."
"`` what did you bring for lunch ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` i do n't know , '' he said , peering down into the contents ."
"`` let 's find out together , shall we ? ''"
"he said and pulled out prettily wrapped packages ."
"unwrapping them , she discovered rosemary chicken , fresh fruit , pungent cheese and a bottle of wine ."
"`` goodness , '' she gasped ."
"`` this is amazing ."
"where did you get this meal ? ''"
"`` i stayed at a little bed and breakfast last night and the owner offered to make the basket this morning ."
"she 's a very good cook , if her breakfast is any way to judge . ''"
"`` do you mean the rosemont inn ? ''"
"tabitha asked ."
"`` that 's ms. betsy ."
"she 's a great cook , '' she replied , handing him a plate filled with food before bending down to make one for herself ."
"`` she makes beautiful wedding cakes ... '' tabitha started to say only to stop self-consciously ."
"`` i mean ... well , i 'm sure you have no need for wedding cakes , '' tabitha stuttered out , sounding silly for even bringing up such a subject ."
"he smiled in her direction , his eyes sparkling at her discomfiture ."
"`` you never know , '' he said ."
"`` good chicken . ''"
"tabitha blushed furiously and looked down at her plate ."
"`` yes , '' she said , wishing she could think of another subject ."
"`` what do you do ? ''"
"she asked , trying to come up with a casual topic ."
"`` a little bit of everything , '' he replied ."
"nikolai watched as the beautiful woman sitting opposite him tried to hide her embarrassment ."
"he wished she would n't ."
"he was completely enchanted with her ."
"she was stunningly pretty but he suspected she had no idea , which only increased her beauty ."
"her soft , blue eyes were filled with everything she was thinking and feeling ."
"there was no artifice , he thought ."
"traveling in his world , he 'd never met someone so honest and compassionate ."
"tabitha was like a breath of fresh air ."
"`` where do you live ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` i travel all over the world , '' he said , which was n't what she was asking ."
"nor was it a lie ."
"nikolai had houses or apartments all over the world , needing them for business purposes ."
"if he was in one city for more than two days , it was odd ."
"in fact , he should be in london tonight for a board meeting with one of his companies , then he was scheduled to fly to madrid for negotiations with a potential acquisition ."
"the next morning , he was due to be in rome for a meeting with new suppliers ."
"he heard her laugh and his body reacted quickly ."
"the soft , feminine sound made him wonder why he 'd spent so much time with the women of his world ."
"why had n't he found tabitha sooner ?"
"she was so genuine , he wanted to both pull her into his arms and make love to her while at the same time , get as far away from her as possible , fearful that his connection to the world of money and power would somehow taint her sweetness ."
"`` so you work at whatever interests you and you live wherever that work takes you ."
"is that an accurate assessment ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` that 's a relatively accurate assessment , yes . ''"
"`` it sounds exciting , '' she said ."
"nikolai shrugged his shoulders , already rescheduling his week so he could have dinner with her tomorrow night ."
"`` it has its moments , '' was all he would say ."
"`` so what do you do when you 're not working ? ''"
"she asked ."
"nikolai thought back to the previous weekend ."
"`` i like boating , '' he replied , thinking of the yacht he 'd just had built ."
"he would like to take her on it , he thought ."
"he could have his helicopter here in twenty minutes and they could simply sail away for some private time , away from the paparazzi that seemed to be hounding him , hungry for whatever his next acquisition was going to be , either female or business , they did n't care as long as it was a juicy story ."
"`` what else ? ''"
"she asked , encouraging him to talk ."
"he looked across the blanket at her ."
"`` i think about how much i want to kiss you , '' he said and was rewarded with her mouth forming a sweet little `` o '' and her eyes widening ."
"she cleared her throat and sat up straighter and nikolai almost laughed out loud ."
"she was interested all right ."
"she was trying to hide her reaction but he could see her nipples peak against the white cotton shirt she was wearing ."
"he kept his eyes upwards , not wanting to give away her body 's reaction if she was n't aware of it already ."
"he almost groaned with his next thought ."
"good grief , was this enchantingly seductive woman a virgin ?"
"his body was on fire for her but if she was a virgin , he would not touch her , he vowed ."
"but thirty minutes later , their lunch cleared up , she was sitting primly on her knees , answering more of his questions , laughing sweetly at his teasing and he simply could n't help himself ."
"she was just too beautiful and more tempting than any man should be asked to refrain from touching ."
"tabitha sat on the blanket , her palms wet with the need to find out what it would be like to kiss him ."
"had she only imagined his comment earlier ?"
"if not , why was n't he moving toward her ?"
"she 'd been on enough dates to know that men usually found some sort of awkward , irritating way to make a move ."
"but this man simply laid back on the blanket , laughing up at her and talking in his sexy , seductive way that formed images in her mind of him talking in bed ."
"`` come here , tabitha , '' nikolai said , his voice now husky and his eyes hooded as he watched her face flush with anticipation ."
"`` what ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` come closer , '' he said ."
"tabitha looked down at her hands and bit her lip ."
"`` nikolai , i do n't ... '' he sat up and looked into her eyes ."
"`` i promise i only want to kiss you , '' he said softly , reassuring her ."
"tabitha was so relieved that he was n't asking more of her , knowing that she wanted more but was n't able to understand exactly what that `` more '' might be ."
"oh , she knew the technicalities of the sexual act , but nothing in her experience could prepare her for nikolai ."
"instead of worrying more , she simply threw herself into his arms , feeling only slightly embarrassed by his grunt when she landed on his chest ."
"but his strong arms controlled her awkward fall and gently rolled her onto her back , his mouth slowly descending toward hers ."
"as soon as his lips touched hers , tabitha knew that she was in trouble ."
"she inhaled sharply as the heat stole through her body , her hands shaking as she touched his cheek with one , while the other tangled into his hair ."
"when his mouth moved slowly over hers , tingles of pleasure surged into her system , and her hands brought him down , closer to her ."
"over and over again , his mouth slanted across hers , his hands moving along her waist , her ribs and her hips while her body moved , begging for more as his mouth taught hers how to share the experience ."
"`` put your tongue in my mouth , '' he instructed hoarsely ."
"when she did that , his body surged upwards ."
"she imitated whatever he did , feeling desire stoke through her body and arching her back ."
"when his hand touched her breast , she cried out as the pleasure became so intense she had trouble controlling her reaction ."
"nikolai held her tightly in his arms , allowing her to come down off the desire slowly ."
"he whispered in her ear , his hand stroking her back as she came back to reality ."
"burying her face in his chest , `` i 'm sorry , '' she said lamely ."
"`` for what ? ''"
"nickolai asked , rolling her back so he was looking down at her ."
"`` i do n't understand what you do to me , '' she said , still trying to catch her breath ."
"`` it 's desire and i guarantee that it is mutual , '' he said , his hand reaching down to bring her hips closer to his ."
"tabitha gasped when she felt the hard evidence of his erection against her thigh ."
"her worried eyes moving up to look into his ."
"`` why ? ''"
"`` do n't question it , '' he said tenderly ."
"`` just enjoy it , '' and he bent to gently touch her lips again , taking her shiver of excitement into his body , thrilled that she was so incredibly responsive ."
"dinner that evening was tense and boring as her father ranted and raved about problems at macccomber industries ."
"susan , the housekeeper , had gone above and beyond with her culinary efforts , fixing a delicious supper for her homecoming ."
"but she doubted that her father tasted any of the delicious roast or savory potatoes ."
"he was too angry and frustrated with the problems cropping up at the factory and with clients ."
"the following evening , tabitha met nikolai at a small restaurant , his appearance again taking her breath away as he stood up in a pair of khakis and a white cotton shirt as she entered , then pulled out the chair for her ."
"she was wearing a yellow sundress that hugged her figure , then flared out softly at her hips ."
"she saw the admiration in his eyes as soon as she walked into the restaurant and was glad that she 'd put so much effort into her appearance ."
"she had no idea what she ate that night , only that nikolai made her laugh , respected her opinions and even encouraged her to find a job and stand up to her father ."
"she was thrilled that he did n't think women 's sole purpose in life was to be married and pregnant ."
"but she was even more thrilled when he took her hand after dessert and led her to his motorcycle ."
"he drove them back up into the hills so they could watch the lights twinkling in the valley ."
"within moments , he pulled her into his arms , kissing her senseless but this time , going one step further , his hands touching her breasts , kissing her neck and nibbling on her ear ."
"tabitha heard her breathing , rapid and out of control ."
"in the distance , she heard a small animal moaning softly but was unaware that it was her own moans and gasps as nikolai took her higher , the desire spiking through her system as he touched her in different places ."
"she was unaware of anything , just desperate to feel him , to hold him and do everything he was doing to her ."
"but when he pulled her underwear off , she was almost mindless with desire ."
"he pulled her back onto his motorcycle , only this time , she was facing him ."
"his hands skimmed her dress , underneath , his fingers hot and his mouth hotter ."
"when his fingers found the wet core of her being , she almost splintered into millions of pieces ."
"but then his fingers started moving , touching her , flicking a sensitive spot and then moving again , she almost screamed out as the pleasure built , reaching almost pain as she arched her back , her hands gripping his shoulders , her nails digging into his muscles ."
"she could barely breathe as he pulled her hips closer , spreading her legs wider , giving him greater access ."
"tabitha did n't care , she was mindless at this point and willing to do anything he told her to do as long as he continued to touch her that way ."
"when the desire got to be too much , her head thrashed back and forth and she almost started crying ."
"`` please , nik ."
"you 've got to stop ! ''"
"she cried out , her hands reaching down to pull his fingers away ."
"but he would n't let her ."
"his other hand slipped inside her dress which had been unbuttoned , his fingers touching her now bare nipple and the double assault was too much ."
"her mind splintered just as her body did and she cried out , biting on his shoulder as she reached her first orgasm ."
"again , nikcolai held her close , whispering things in greek she did n't understand but she could n't let go of him , her arms wrapped around his shoulder as her body slowly floated down to earth ."
"when she was able to focus once again , she looked up , directly into his dark , passion drugged eyes ."
"her mouth was still open and she shook her head slightly ."
"`` i never knew , '' she started to say ."
"when she saw his smile broaden , she buried her face in his shoulder , embarrassed beyond belief at what she 'd allowed him to do to her ."
"`` do n't hide your reactions from me , agape mou , '' he said and pulled back , looking into her soft , blue eyes once again ."
"`` i want to see it all , every time i touch you . ''"
"she was suddenly conscious of the bulge in his slacks and was grateful for the darkness which hid her pink cheeks ."
"`` what about you ? ''"
"she asked , licking her dry lips and wondering if she could give him the same amount of pleasure , but not sure what to do ."
"`` do n't worry about me . ''"
"`` but ... '' ' she started to say but his lips covered hers , silencing her protest ."
"the next three days were the most magical of tabitha 's life ."
"thursday , they went for a hike in the woods , talking about politics and the latest books ."
"tabitha was astounded that the man was so well read and she discovered that he spoke five languages fluently ."
"she never questioned why he appeared to be a drifter , fearful that he would be offended and leave ."
"she asked him for his resume , offering to put it in to her father 's company so he could find a position within the organization ."
"tabitha was powerfully disappointed when he simply smiled , not committing to her suggestion ."
"she ignored the stab of pain she felt around her heart , knowing that the only reason she suggested the idea was so he might find a home in the village ."
"at that moment , she made the decision that she would simply take whatever he could give her and live in the moment ."
"whatever time he was here would be enough ."
"by friday though , the shoe dropped and he delivered the news that had her gasping for air as the pain sliced through her body ."
"`` i have to leave , '' nikolai said as they sat on a log , her back against his chest and his arms securely around her waist while his chin rested on her shoulder ."
"tabitha immediately stiffened but he would n't let her pull away ."
"`` why ? ''"
"she asked , the fear and pain apparent in her voice ."
"`` why ca n't you just stay ? ''"
"`` because i have things to do ."
"people rely on me ."
"i 've been away too long already , '' he explained with his deep , sexy voice ."
"she 'd known this time would come but she had no idea how much it would hurt ."
"the tears immediately started falling and she turned her face around so he could n't see them ."
"`` i understand , '' she said , her voice trembling ."
"nikolai turned her back around , relentlessly forcing her to face him ."
"looking down into her tear filled eyes , he smiled gently ."
"`` come with me , '' he said ."
"tabitha looked up at him sharply ."
"`` what ? ''"
"`` come with me ."
"marry me and be my wife ."
"i 'll take care of you and i promise you 'll never want for anything , '' he said softly ."
"hope flared inside her heart and she threw her arms around his shoulders ."
"`` are you serious ?"
"you want to marry me ? ''"
"his handsome smile made the butterflies dance around in her stomach ."
"`` yes ."
"i know you do n't want to be married and pregnant , but i promise you 'll never regret becoming my wife ."
"we do n't have to have children immediately ."
"you can find your career ."
"just do it with me instead of alone . ''"
"tabitha could barely breathe but for a completely different reason now ."
"she was so deliriously happy she could hardly believe it ."
"`` yes ! ''"
"she said ."
"`` oh , yes !"
"i do n't care where we go as long as we can be together , '' she cried between hiccups , her arms tightening around his neck ."
"she was thrilled when he lifted her into his arms , holding her closely ."
"after several long minutes when she thoroughly enjoyed his kiss , his hands holding her against his hard length , he stopped suddenly and took a deep breath ."
"`` i 'll need to speak with your father ."
"when will he be available ? ''"
"he asked , pulling back to look down into her expressive blue eyes that were still filled with tears ."
"his thumb caught one as it slipped from her lash to her soft cheek ."
"`` i assume these are tears of happiness ? ''"
"`` yes , '' she laughed and threw her arms back around his neck ."
"`` oh , nikolai !"
"i ca n't believe this is happening !"
"i love you so much ."
"i know it has only been a week but you make me feel things i never thought were possible ."
"i 've never felt this way before about anyone i 've dated . ''"
"`` and your father ? ''"
"he asked again , laughing at her enthusiasm ."
"that reminder doused her happiness only minimally ."
"her father definitely would n't approve of nik 's career choices , or lack of them ."
"but she also knew that , once her father got to know nikolai , he would love him just as much as she did ."
"there was no doubt in her mind ."
"`` oh !"
"yes . ''"
"she pulled back and considered what she knew of her father 's schedule ."
"`` well , i guess he 'll be available tonight although he is having some clients come by ."
"and then he 's going away for the weekend ."
"he 's been under a lot of stress lately but i 'm not sure exactly why , '' she explained ."
"`` perhaps business is not going as well as normal ? ''"
"nik suggested , knowing that was actually the case ."
"he had seen the slow decline of the stock prices over the past few days and had dug a little deeper into the issues ."
"he had never thought about asking a father for a woman 's hand in marriage but he knew how to run a business , had been the driving force behind his family 's shipping empire for the past ten years and had more than doubled the vast andretti holdings , expanding into manufacturing and inland distribution , making the entire business more efficient and powerful ."
"he kept his suspicions about her father 's business to himself , not wanting to concern tabitha if her father had it under control ."
"she shrugged , unsure of what was happening at her father 's factory ."
"`` i do n't know ."
"i 'm sure its something , but he 's always been able to pull through these things in the past . ''"
"nikolai did n't want to voice his doubts about that at this time ."
"once they were married , he would offer his assistance to her father , perhaps pull him out of what nikolai suspected was a very deep and expensive hole ."
"`` come , let 's get this over with so we can start planning the wedding , '' he said , taking hold of her hand and guiding her back to the motorcycle ."
"when they arrived at the house five minutes later , it was to see her father shaking hands with another man ."
"tabitha had seen the shorter man on several occasions but had stayed out of the way , knowing that her father was working on what she sensed was a very sensitive business deal with him ."
"tabitha was only slightly nervous when they rode up , noticing that her father 's eyes narrowed at the motorcycle and leather jacket ."
"good grief , she thought to herself , her father acted like this was the nineteen sixties and a leather jacket immediately spelled trouble ."
"`` tabitha !"
"where have you been all afternoon ? ''"
"he demanded as soon as the engine was turned off ."
"`` lucy munroe has been calling , asking for help with her bridesmaid 's dress . ''"
"`` really ? ''"
"tabitha said , confused by both his abruptness at her appearance and his obvious rudeness in front of nikolai ."
"tabitha was surprised that her father had n't waited for an introduction to nik before firing off a comment like that ."
"being the owner of the largest business in the village , edward maccomber was intensely aware of appearances and went out of his way to be polite even to the church gardener ."
"it was also odd that lucy was worried about the bridesmaid 's dress she was wearing to her brother 's wedding this weekend ."
"tabitha had seen lucy try it on a couple of days earlier and it was fine ."
"`` yes ."
"i suspect that you should head over there immediately to see what is going on , '' he continued ."
"`` dresses can be tricky things , you know ."
"and everything has to look perfect for weddings ."
"do n't they ? ''"
"the words were spoken to tabitha , but she suspected that they were actually directed at nik for some reason ."
"her father was acting very odd ."
"tabitha looked up at nik and shook her head ."
"`` but , father , i think nikolai needs to discuss something with you ."
"it is rather important . ''"
"she was trying to hide the happiness she was currently feeling but knew that some of it was coming out in her expression ."
"the color in edward 's face drained away and he harrumphed quickly ."
"`` i suspect that whatever this man needs to talk to me about does not require your attention ."
"so go along , '' he said in a patronizing voice ."
"`` see what you can do to help lucy with her dress while i discuss whatever it is this man wants to discuss with me . ''"
"without another word , edward walked into the house , leaving the front door open to allow nik to either follow or not , uncaring about either eventuality ."
"tabitha looked up at nik , an apology already on her lips but he put a finger to stop her ."
"`` go along to help your friend ."
"i 'll speak to your father and i 'll see you when you are through , '' he said , giving her a gentle kiss before moving off with confidence to the front door ."
"a tingle of fear went through her body for a moment , but she banished it , knowing that nik of all people would be able to overcome any arguments her father might have ."
"and even if he could n't , tabitha was too happy about starting a life with nik ."
"she would leave her father 's house if he did n't approve of her marriage ."
"she was in love and , although she knew love would n't put food on the table , she was confident enough that they would never starve ."
"she was n't afraid of being poor ."
"she was more afraid of living without nik than anything else ."
"she rushed off hurriedly , wanting to find out what lucy had called about so she could quickly come back to nik and start making plans ."
"after watching tabitha walk through the immaculate yard , entranced by her simple grace and elegance , nik followed tabitha 's father into the house ."
"nik assumed the man would find some position of strength , which is exactly how he would treat this situation ."
"nik was struck by the idea of a common bond with edward ."
"knowing that he wanted to have children with tabitha , possibly a girl , he could understand , to a point , where edward 's animosity was coming from ."
"he would n't like giving up his daughter to a stranger , someone who had never been properly introduced to his family ."
"nor would his family allow it ."
"having that insight , nik found edward in the man 's office ."
"`` good afternoon , sir ."
"i 'd like to introduce myself , '' he said , reaching out to offer his hand to the older man ."
"`` i 'm nikolai andredetti , '' he said , as if that would be enough ."
"`` forget all these niceties , '' edward growled rudely , ignoring nik 's outstretched hand as he sat back in his large , leather chair and lit a cigar , not bothering to offer nik one ."
"`` how much will it take to get rid of you ?"
"and do n't be too greedy ."
"despite the nice , large house and owning my own company , i 'm pretty stretched for cash right now . ''"
"nik 's face hardened with contempt ."
"the man actually thought nik could be bought ?"
"the man did n't have enough money in his bank account to buy an andretti ."
"there was n't enough money in the world , he thought to himself ."
"he tempered his anger , reminding himself that the man was tabitha 's father ."
"`` i do n't think you understand , '' nik started again , knowing he 'd have to explain further ."
"`` i 'm not asking for money ."
"i just want your daughter 's hand in marriage . ''"
"hearing the words , edward exploded out of his chair , his cigar precariously dangling from his round fingers as his anger took over , making his face red and his eyes look like they could pop out of their sockets at any moment ."
"`` are you out of your mind ?"
"there 's no way in hell i 'd let my daughter marry a loser like you ."
"my daughter has class and elegance ."
"she 's beautiful dammit !"
"and you have the audacity to come here and think you 're good enough for her ?"
"i do n't think you have the right to clean her shoes ! ''"
"something in nik 's expression must have shown edward that his intimidation tactics were not going to work on nik and he abruptly changed , visibly forcing himself to calm down and return to his desk and leather chair ."
"`` besides , she 's already engaged ."
"i 'm not sure what she 's been telling you for the past week , but she 's scheduled to be married in two weeks ."
"that 's one of the reasons i 'm so strapped for cash right now ."
"the dammed wedding is the talk of the town and every one plus their mother is coming around to finally see my daughter get married ."
"the plans have already been made , dress picked out and even the cake ordered ."
"why the hell do you think lucy needs help with a bridesmaid 's dress ?"
"tabitha wants everything perfect for her wedding ."
"not a flower out of place ! ''"
"he puffed slightly on his cigar , watching nik through a cloud of smoke ."
"`` so tell me , what did she say or do to convince you that she was available ? ''"
"his mocking smile enraging nik almost as much as his words had ."
"nik placed his hands on his hips and shook his head ."
"all thoughts about the past week were prancing through his mind and everything he knew about tabitha told him that this man was lying ."
"`` i do n't believe you ."
"you 're daughter is not that kind of a woman . ''"
"edward laughed heartily ."
"`` you think so ?"
"want to know how many men she 's had offers of marriage from ?"
"men have tick marks for each woman he beds ."
"tabitha , i 'm ashamed to say , makes tick marks for each proposal of marriage she 's managed to elicit from the men of this town . ''"
"his eyes narrowed and he puffed during the silence ."
"`` what did she promise you ?"
"that she 'd be willing to live in poverty with you ?"
"that she wanted only you and you 're the only man who 's touched her ? ''"
"nik 's mind was whirling ."
"he 'd only known tabitha for less than a week ."
"his instincts were telling him that this man was lying to him ."
"but why would he do that ?"
"he obviously did n't know the andretti name or he would definitely be singing a different tune ."
"every momma from london to greece , and probably even beyond , had been trying to marry off their eligible daughters to nik ever since he came of age in the hopes of tapping in to the andretti billions as well as the prestige and power that came along with that wealth ."
"edward chuckled , moving in for the kill ."
"`` forget about her ."
"and do n't worry about her at all ."
"i can guarantee that my daughter will stop her teasing in two weeks ."
"her new husband has been forgiving enough but he wo n't allow her to continue her chase after their wedding ."
"he 'll be very demanding of her time and attention ."
"so why do n't you head on out to your next stop on the road and charm some other woman ?"
"tabitha will have forgotten about you by the time she gets back from lucy 's house ."
"have no fears ."
"in fact , she 'll probably be grateful to me for getting rid of you so easily ."
"tabitha does n't really like to do her dirty work . ''"
"nik stood there for another long moment , wanting to challenge him but unable to do so ."
"it was entirely possible that tabitha was stringing him along ."
"he remembered the odd looks from some of the town 's people as they 'd eaten at various places ."
"at the time , he 'd simply assumed that the looks were due to him being a stranger out with their local beauty ."
"but it made more sense that the looks were due to an imminent wedding that everyone was involved in planning ."
"and he could n't discount the nights she said she 'd have to be home with her family ."
"had that actually been the nights she was with her fiance ?"
"he 'd never been invited home , despite the fact tabitha knew that he did n't work during the day ."
"she 'd mentioned once that she liked having him as a secret ."
"how much of a secret was he really ?"
"at the time , he 'd been amused by the idea since he too had been keeping their relationship a secret , enjoying dating a woman without the paparazzi trailing his every move and photographing him , speculating on the newest woman 's romantic powers over him and the potential for a marriage proposal ."
"this week had been a novel period in his life ."
"but had it been simply fantasy ?"
"the feelings tabitha had stirred within him had not been fantasy , but perhaps the idea of love for him was just that , unreal and never would be ."
"a stab of pain sliced through his gut at that idea ."
"`` mull those little tid bits around in that good-looking brain of yours , '' edward said jovially ."
"`` if it 's any consolation , i 'll let you in on the fact that you 're probably the most handsome man she 's dallied with ."
"most of them are a little less ... .manly , '' he said , chuckling at some sort of joke that only he knew about ."
"nik stiffened , accepting that the man was telling the truth about tabitha ."
"nik could think of no reason a father would say such vile things about his daughter unless they were true ."
"`` i see ."
"well , in that case , i 'll see myself out ."
"please explain to tabitha that i am glad that i was at least her most 'manly ' suitor , '' nik said ."
"he bowed slightly , a mocking salutation to the man who had raised such a promiscuous daughter ."
"nik walked out into the bright sunshine , stunned that the world still looked exactly as it had only thirty minutes ago , yet at the same time , it looked bleaker , more sinister ."
"and definitely less forgiving ."
"climbing on his motorcycle , he revved the engine and , without a backwards look or even putting on his helmet , nik drove off , heading back to london ."
"as soon as he had the small town 's outskirts behind him , he pulled out his cell phone as he recklessly turned the corner , barely pulling out in time to avoid colliding with a wall of rock to the left of the road ."
"calling his pa , he ordered the helicopter to get into the air and find him along the highway ."
"he knew the helicopter was able to land in just about any field and he could be back at work within fifteen minutes , versus the hour long ride to london via motorcycle ."
"he was due in milan tomorrow and there was a family gathering the next day ."
"with a determined expression on his face , he considered all the activities he could use to distract him from this week and erase his foolish behavior from his mind ."
"he was used to working eighteen hour days but after the week with tabitha , he pushed his staff harder , sometimes working straight through the night and into the next day ."
"he saw the news of tabitha 's wedding by accident in the papers and all of his anger increased as he read the evidence of edward 's words ."
"that afternoon , the crushed newspaper by his side , he stopped all negotiations with a particularly difficult acquisition and , within two days , he had accomplished through merciless business tactics what several months of negotiations would have done ."
"that was the point when his enemies started quivering when he entered the room and even his friends began to hide ."
"no one crossed nik after that takeover ."
"an hour after leaving nik , tabitha was running happily back across the lawn , sure that the conversation with her father was finished and she 'd be able to throw herself into his arms and experience the blissful feelings only he could show her ."
"her steps faltered when she did n't see the motorcycle still in the front ."
"rushing into the house , she called out for her father ."
"she eventually found him in his room pulling on his suit jacket ."
"`` father ?"
"what happened ? ''"
"she asked , a smile forming across her face as the happiness she was feeling she was unable to contain ."
"edward looked down at his daughter , then his eyes slid away ."
"`` he 's gone , '' was all he said ."
"tabitha laughed joyfully , unconcerned despite his gruff , almost angry disposition ."
"nothing could bother her now , knowing that she and nik would be together ."
"`` i know he 's gone ."
"his motorcycle was gone from the driveway ."
"but are n't you happy for me ? ''"
"she asked , clasping her hands together and almost jumping up and down in excitement ."
"edward straightened the cuffs of his suit jacket and shook his head ."
"`` no ."
"he 's gone ."
"i kicked him out of the house . ''"
"that stunned tabitha but she still did n't understand ."
"`` but why ? ''"
"she asked , some of her happiness fading ."
"`` why on earth would you do something like that ?"
"please do n't tell me you were rude to him . ''"
"edward 's face turned red at tabitha 's admonition and his eyes sharpened as he turned fully toward his daughter ."
"`` rude ?"
"the man comes in here and tells me he wants to take you away ?"
"and you do n't think i have a right to be rude to the arrogant bastard ?"
"of course i was rude ."
"and if he ever shows his face in this town again , i 'll make sure he 's arrested and dragged down the street in chains !"
"no daughter of mine is going to be used by a drifter with no prospects and no future ! ''"
"tabitha started shaking her head in denial midway through his explosion ."
"`` no father !"
"you misunderstood ."
"he wants to marry me ! ''"
"edward puffed up , his face almost turning purple ."
"`` marriage !"
"i do n't think so , tabitha ."
"marriage was never brought up today ."
"in fact , exactly the opposite !"
"the man only wants your body and said you 'd been a perfect tease for the past week ."
"what do you think i am supposed to say about something so awful !"
"a father will never allow his daughter to be used like that . ''"
"tabitha cringed at her father 's words but shook her head , denying the possibility that nik would say such things ."
"he was a gentleman ."
"he would never reveal the things they had done together ."
"not to anyone !"
"`` no , really !"
"you misunderstood !"
"he 's not like that ."
"he 's extremely intelligent and we 'll find some way to live happily . ''"
"`` the man 's a womanizer ! '"
"he shouted back ."
"`` ca n't you see that he just goes from one woman to another , demanding money in exchange for leaving them alone ? ''"
"his angry tirade became even angrier ."
"`` i would n't pay him a dime and that angered him ."
"even if he was serious about marrying you , which he was n't , there is no way i would let my only daughter marry a drifter !"
"he 's nothing ."
"he 's one of those people we support with our tax dollars because they live off society ."
"i 'm not allowing my daughter to marry someone who ca n't even support himself , and would n't allow you to live in the lifestyle to which you deserve ."
"no , tabitha ."
"that marriage is not happening ."
"not over my dead body ! ''"
"tabitha was already sobbing at his hurtful words ."
"`` you 're wrong about nik ."
"he 's not like that ."
"he was sincere about marrying me and he 'd never go on to another woman !"
"we 're in love and i 'm going to find him and tell him that i do n't care about your approval ."
"he wo n't either . ''"
"edward whipped his half smoked cigar out of his mouth , pointing it at her as he yelled , `` bite your tongue young lady !"
"i forbid you to contact that man and i 've told him that already ."
"you wo n't be hearing from him ever again ! ''"
"he turned away from her and stared out the window , dismissing tabitha and accepting that she would bend to his will ."
"all people bent to what he decreed ."
"it was the way this village worked and he would accept nothing less from his daughter ."
"tabitha ran out of the room and up to her bedroom , terrified of his words ."
"she immediately picked up the phone and called nik 's mobile number but he did n't answer it ."
"nor did he answer the phone for the next several days , leaving tabitha to start to question his sincerity ."
"as much as she fought against her doubts , the longer it took her to reach him , the more the insidious thoughts invaded her psyche ."
"she hated that , wanted desperately to believe that what they 'd felt for each other was real and lasting ."
"but as the days passed by , she wondered if his feelings for her had been sincere ."
"she avoided her father completely , staying in her room until she was sure he had gone for the day , then making sure she had something to do outside the house for the evening , not coming home until late ."
"sometimes it meant she would stay at the library , hiding in the stacks and staring at a book , her tortured mind unable to absorb any of the words on the pages ."
"other times , she would be with friends , but only in a physical sense ."
"her thoughts were constantly wondering about nik ; where he was , what he was doing and upper most in her list of questions , why had he left her like this with no word ?"
"one evening while laying in bed , once again unable to sleep , she simply stared up at the ceiling , the tears silently falling to dampen her pillows ."
"desperate , she sat up and grabbed her mobile , dialing nik 's number once again ."
"it was almost midnight and she 'd tried so many times that day to reach nik on the phone but without success ."
"she was phoning him one last time that night in the hopes that she could reach him before bed ."
"on the fifth ring , tabitha 's heart soared ."
"`` nik ? ''"
"she called out as the phone was finally answered instead of going to voice mail ."
"`` who 's this ? ''"
"a sultry , female voice asked ."
"tabitha 's heart plummeted ."
"`` is this nik 's phone ? ''"
"she asked , hoping she 'd just had the wrong phone number all this time and that the woman with the sexy voice owned the phone instead of nik ."
"she hated the idea that her father could be right about nik 's character ."
"unfortunately , her dreams were about to crash yet again ."
"`` yes , it is ."
"who is calling ? ''"
"the female demanded ."
"tabitha heard laughter and music in the background ."
"the words her father had spoken just a few days ago came back to her ."
"were they true ?"
"was nik already on to the next woman ?"
"the idea stabbed through her stomach , leaving her gasping for breath ."
"`` no one , '' she said miserably ."
"`` just forget that i called . ''"
"two days later , tabitha did n't hear the knock that sounded on her door as she laid down on her bed , staring off at the wall ."
"she could n't cry , could n't think ."
"she was in too much pain to even care when her father walked in without waiting for her to reply ."
"`` tabitha !"
"what are you doing lying around ? ''"
"he demanded angrily ."
"he was dressed , as usual , in a business suit but his hair was slightly more rumpled , as if he 'd been running his fingers through it recently ."
"she did n't even bother to answer him , continuing to simply stare at the wall ."
"her lack of response did n't bother him in the least ."
"`` well , never mind that ."
"i do n't really care anyway ."
"here 's the issue ."
"you wanted to get married , so i 've found you a husband , '' he stated roughly ."
"`` the man is very well connected and will maintain the standard of living you 're used to . ''"
"no response ."
"`` you 'll be married next week , since i understand you 're in an all-fired hurry to start married life , '' he explained ."
"still , no response ."
"`` i 'll have lydia start on your wedding dress , '' he said gruffly and walked out , slamming the door behind him ."
"one week later , tabitha somehow found herself in front of the village minister saying her vows to the man who had been in the driveway that awful afternoon when nik had left her ."
"she did n't care if she married the stranger , uncaring about anything after nik 's betrayal ."
"she 'd trusted him , fell in love with him and finding out that he was nothing like the man she 'd thought he was had been too painful ."
"she did n't trust her own instincts so why not marry her father 's choice ?"
"reality hit harder than she had expected ."
"as far as she knew , the wedding went off without a hitch although she was unaware of anything around her ."
"even the kiss after the vows did nothing to break her out of her misery ."
"it was n't until the honeymoon started that night that the horror of her marriage was to arrive and break through her depression ."
"she nervously changed into a silk negligee , banishing the thought that she wished nik could see her like this and swallowing her revulsion at the idea of her new husband , a virtual stranger , would be touching her the way nik had touched her so many weeks ago ."
"she hated the idea , but love had n't worked out for her ."
"this was her lot in life , she assumed sadly ."
"walking into the luxurious hotel room that was to be their first stop on a two week long vacation , she stood in the doorway , horror dawning on her face as she watched her groom in the process of making love to his best man ."
"`` get out ! ''"
"she heard him yell at her ."
"tabitha did n't wait for another warning , she spun on her heel and slammed the bathroom door , terrified of what she 'd seen and heard ."
"shaking in misery , she sank down on to the bathroom floor , her mind whirling at how her life had become one painful nightmare after another ."
"she slept on the bathroom floor that night , crying herself to sleep and unaware that she 'd actually slept until her husband nudged her with his toe the following morning ."
"`` we 're leaving , '' was all he said before stepping into the shower naked ."
"the two weeks in a caribbean resort were not as bad ."
"knowing that they would be spending more time together , her husband , jerry , had booked a two bedroom suite ."
"she stayed by herself , angry and terrified of anyone discovering that her husband preferred a man to herself ."
"once back home , living in the man 's house , she found that he had an angry temper ."
"`` i 'm leaving , '' she said as soon as they walked into the house she was supposed to live in with him ."
"`` where are you going ? ''"
"he snarled ."
"she shivered in revulsion at the man standing in front of the door , hindering her departure ."
"`` i do n't know ."
"but i 'm not staying in this marriage or this house anymore ."
"i 'll get an annulment and i 'll find my own place to live , '' she said , moving toward the garage door since he obviously was n't going to let her leave through the front ."
"he grabbed her by her arm and swung her around ."
"`` do n't even think about it , '' he snapped ."
"`` you leave and your father 's business goes down the drain ."
"he 's in a lot of trouble financially and , let 's just say i 'm helping him out of the mess he 's made of the business . ''"
"`` what are you talking about ? ''"
"she demanded , her eyes widening at his accusation ."
"he sneered at her shocked expression a moment before his eyes dropped down her body ."
"`` i mean , your father is a complete failure at running that boring little factory he inherited ."
"he needed someone to lead him out of the pit the business had fallen into ."
"and i needed someone to act as my hostess and make sure the gossips do n't continue with their accusations and assumptions about my sexual preferences ."
"i ca n't do business in this small town with people thinking i 'm more into men than women . ''"
"his eyes sliced down her figure again ."
"`` and you fit the bill perfectly , '' he sneered ."
"`` all those rumors are gone now that you 're supposedly sharing my bed ."
"so just sit pretty and everything will be fine ."
"make any move to leave , and i 'll demand all the money back from your father . ''"
"`` i do n't believe you !"
"my father 's business is not in financial trouble , much less bankrupt if that 's what you are implying ."
"he 's a financial genius and can fix just about anything . ''"
"`` ask him , '' jerry replied , smiling mercilessly ."
"tabitha did just that and was stunned to hear her father confirm jerry 's statement ."
"jerry died in a car accident six months after her wedding so before she could figure out how to save the factory and get out of her marriage , the nightmare was over ."
"her father died of a heart attack two months later ."
"despite the painful previous nine months , tabitha stepped into her father 's shoes at that point and cut costs , energized the staff by reassuring everyone that she would find an adequate replacement as the head of the company , someone with vigor and drive that would hold maccomber industries together and take it into the next one hundred years ."
"she remained on as one of the board of directors , but knew she did n't have the experience to run the company ."
"she nominated one of the vice presidents , nelson , to step in and run the company ."
"coming back to the present , she realized she had n't eaten any of her frozen meal and it was now just a congealed mess on the plastic , microwaveable tray ."
"she threw it into the trash and thought about the three years since her father 's death ."
"the rest , she thought miserably as she wiped her hands and left the kitchen , was history ."
"in bed that night , tabitha looked out the window of her bedroom and forced her mind to stop dwelling on the past ."
"she picked up the business card again and looked down at the number ."
"she had to reach out to him and somehow convince him that he 'd be hurting an entire village with his course of action ."
"calling the phone number listed on the card , her fingers shook as she brought the receiver to her ear ."
"he answered on the second ring and her hand tightened in fear and something else she did n't want to identify ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"the deep voice answered ."
"`` nikolai ? ''"
"tabitha asked , hoping her voice did n't sound scared to his ears ."
"`` yes tabitha ."
"have you come to a decision ? ''"
"he asked casually , as if he could n't care less one way or the other which answer she gave him ."
"taking a deep breath to steady her nerves , she forced her mind to move forward , knowing she had to convince him that this was not good for either of them ."
"`` well , i wanted to talk to you about that . ''"
"there was a moment of silence ."
"`` i did n't think this would be a hard equation for someone of your intellect to work through ."
"you 're a smart woman , tabitha , if a little loose on the morals side of things , '' he said ."
"tabitha gasped , `` why , you arrogant bastard !"
"i ca n't believe someone with your history with women could possibly call me loose ! ''"
"`` did n't you sell yourself to your dead husband ?"
"basically , you 're doing the same thing now ."
"is the price so much different ? ''"
"he asked ."
"he could n't know anything about her marriage !"
"`` no !"
"that was a completely different arrangement , '' she said , humiliated at the mere mention of her horrible marriage ."
"`` ah , you 're a hypocrite as well , eh ? ''"
"he chuckled ."
"`` i 'm not sure you understand the true impact of this situation , tabitha ."
"if you do n't come to me tomorrow afternoon with the right answer , you 're company will no longer exist ."
"the same thing happened right before you sold yourself to jerry manning ."
"i understand immediately after your wedding , there was a significant influx of cash to maccomber industries ."
"you , in fact , saved your father 's company from going under ."
"just think of this as being the same thing , which , in fact , it is . ''"
"`` it is n't , '' she stated emphatically ."
"she knew there 'd been an exchange of funds but she could n't dwell on that humiliation , so she focused on what she did n't understand ."
"`` you ca n't really expect me to go through with this , do you ? ''"
"`` i think we should discuss this tomorrow over lunch , '' he said smoothly ."
"`` i 'll meet you at my office at twelve o'clock sharp ."
"if you 're not there , i 'll assume you 've turned down my offer and will begin the sales ."
"i already have three potential buyers in line for the parts to the factory . ''"
"there was a long pause before he said softly , `` do n't let me down , tabitha . ''"
"tabitha dropped the receiver as if were on fire , then buried her face in her hands ."
"he knew !"
"how could he possibly know about her terrible marriage ?"
"did he know everything ?"
"could he know that jerry had had no interest in her ?"
"that just the thought of touching her made him cringe ?"
"their entire six month marriage had been a sham put on for society and to this day , she remained untouched , disgusted whenever any man wanted to touch her ."
"men were horrible , vile creatures , she reminded herself ."
"the one man she had trusted with all her heart had broken her trust and her faith ."
"she moved from that terrible relationship to a man who could n't stand her ."
"to this day , she refused all dates , fearing that she was simply cursed when it came to relationships ."
"and now here was further proof ."
"but how could she go to him tomorrow ?"
"he would discover her secret and she would be humiliated all over again ."
"two men in her life - neither of whom really wanted to touch her ."
"well , nik wanted to touch her but he also wanted the freedom to move on to the next woman before he said goodbye to her ."
"chapter 4 tabitha smoothed her skirt and held her purse in her hands , afraid nik might see that her hands were shaking if she did n't have something to hold ."
"walking up to the security desk at ten minutes to twelve was the most terrifying moment of her life ."
"she had no choice ."
"during the hour long drive to london this morning , she 'd debated back and forth , coming up with one argument after another ."
"did she have a chance to persuade him to change his mind ?"
"maybe - if she were extremely convincing , she could tell him about the people who depended on the company ."
"people who had dedicated their lives to maccomber industries and did n't deserve to be pawns in a rich man 's revenge ."
"the security guard standing sentry in the lobby of nik 's office building politely handed her a plastic badge , then directed her to a private elevator in the back of the lobby ."
"within moments , she was walking down the thick carpeting of the hallway toward a set of double doors ."
"the halls were quiet but people were rushing about quickly , efficiently , as if they all had an urgent purpose ."
"meanwhile , she dragged her feet slowly , unwilling to rush to her execution ."
"when she reached the doors , a smart , efficient looking woman in a brown tweed suit and gray hair smiled at her ."
"`` ms. maccomber , mr. andretti will only be a moment ."
"if you 'll have a seat , i 'll let him know you are waiting . ''"
"she waved her hand toward an elegant sitting area right outside a set of double doors ."
"tabitha nodded and felt as if she 'd been given a small reprieve ."
"taking a seat on one of the long , comfortable looking sofas , she closed her eyes and focused on breathing in and out ."
"this had to be the most convincing argument she 'd ever make in her life ."
"if she failed ... tabitha shuddered , unwilling to consider the repercussions ."
"`` meditation ? ''"
"a deep voice chuckled ."
"tabitha 's eyes flashed open and she stared up into the amused face of nikolai ."
"had she thought he was handsome in jeans and a leather jacket ?"
"today , in this ultra modern environment with a black suit and red , silk tie , the man was devastatingly gorgeous ."
"her body , remembering only the desire his hands were able to evoke within her , was starting to tremble ."
"a response was needed , but her mind simply refused to work ."
"she could only stare up at him ."
"one eyebrow raised in question , `` i 'm sure you have something to say to me but perhaps it would be more appropriately discussed in my office versus here in the reception area ? ''"
"his calm demeanor somehow snapped tabitha out of her reverie and she stood up quickly , her purse dropping to the floor ."
"thankfully , nothing spilled out but as she bent to pick it up , her skirt rose up higher on her thighs , revealing a good bit of her legs before she could stand up and cover herself again ."
"`` was n't that the way this whole thing started ? ''"
"he asked , reminding her of the afternoon she rode on his motorcycle in a skirt ."
"gasping , she pushed down the material quickly , her face heating up with embarrassment ."
"was there no end to how this man could torment her ?"
"`` i would think that those memories would be pushed out of your mind by now ."
"they certainly have for me , '' she said and brushed passed him through the open doorway ."
"she heard the door close behind her and shivered ."
"`` what 's your answer ? ''"
"he asked , walking casually to lean against his desk and watching her as she looked out over the city of london ."
"nik watched in fascination as she debated silently with herself on how to start the conversation ."
"her shoulders sagged slightly before she found some inner core of strength ."
"turning to face him , he had to admire her courage ."
"his body instantly reacted , hardening painfully and all he wanted to hear was her answer ."
"he knew it would be the right one ."
"he remembered talking to her four years ago and she had so much pride in her little village , laughing about the foibles of some of the members but also trying hard to convince him about their good sides as well ."
"at the time , he 'd thought she was quaint ."
"now , knowing that all of his efforts depended on whether she had been faking that feeling too , he tensed ."
"`` i wanted to appeal to your better nature , '' she said , forcing a smile on her face ."
"`` you might not respect women very much but i 'm hoping you respect hard working employees and their families . ''"
"`` who says i do n't respect women ? ''"
"she blinked at his interruption ."
"`` i do ."
"you ca n't treat women the way you treated me all those years ago and then expect me to believe that you respect them now , do you ? ''"
"she asked , losing her polite mask as the anger welled up in her chest ."
"his face showed no emotion to either her accusation nor the emotions threatening to choke her ."
"`` on the contrary ."
"i treated you with complete respect ."
"it was not me who sold my body to the highest bidder . ''"
"his eyes turned speculative and he asked , `` by the way , how did your father feel the day he realized how wealthy and powerful i was ? ''"
"`` i do n't think he ever ... . ''"
"tabitha stopped , remembering one afternoon when she came to the house after her wedding only to hear him ranting and raving about bad choices and leather jackets ."
"he smiled sardonically ."
"`` i can tell from your expression that he soon regretted tossing me out of the house ."
"but i 'll let you in on a secret , '' he said , moving closer ."
"`` i did some digging into the company 's history and found some interesting details ."
"all of my money and power would have been useless in your father 's case ."
"he was an arrogant son of a bitch who ignored sound business advice ."
"he was doomed from the moment he took the reigns from your grandfather . ''"
"tabitha gritted her teeth and considered defending her father ."
"but in the end , she could n't ."
"by the time of his death , he had killed all the feelings she 'd had inside her due to his callous treatment of her as simply an object to sell to another person ."
"she did n't mention that to nik , knowing it would only condemn her further in his eyes ."
"and it would also raise questions about her marriage which she could n't ... wouldn't.. discuss with him ."
"`` let 's leave my father out of this , shall we ? ''"
"she said tightly ."
"nik 's smile increased ."
"`` i thought so , '' he said and shrugged ."
"`` just goes to show you that you should n't judge a book by its cover . ''"
"`` i never did that , '' she challenged ."
"`` did n't you ? ''"
"he asked , moving closer ."
"`` oh , i think you probably liked my attentions while you were secure in the knowledge that daddy had all the money you could possibly spend ."
"but when it came down to living without it and marrying me , someone you thought had nothing , or marrying someone you thought could maintain your lifestyle , there really was no question , was there ? ''"
"tabitha did n't want to reveal to him how much she had genuinely felt for him four years ago ."
"she felt foolish now ."
"`` let 's just chalk up four years ago to inexperience and move on , shall we ? ''"
"`` that 's exactly what i 'm willing to do ."
"but that experience tells me that you and i will still be incredible in bed together ."
"and i want what i denied myself all those years ago . ''"
"he paused for effect ."
"`` if i 'd known how cheap you were willing to sell yourself back then , i 'd probably have paid the price ."
"but now , i 'm ready to gain back what i consider mine . ''"
"she did n't want to hear the answer ."
"she told herself not to ask ."
"but somehow , the words just slipped out ."
"`` you mean me ? ''"
"she hated herself for asking once the words slipped out of her mouth ."
"`` of course ."
"you sold yourself once to save the company ."
"what 's the decision this time ? ''"
"he asked , moving behind his desk and shuffling through his papers ."
"tabitha was furious that her decision was of so little import to him that he could easily move on to the next business deal , which of course was all he considered this situation ."
"her body was practically shaking with the rage she was currently feeling ."
"she wished she could smack his smug face and scratch his eyes out ."
"he could n't care less that he 'd put her into an awful position ."
"it was all about his wants and his desires , discarding the families that would be out of work and a village that would slowly shrivel up and die without the factory and the revenue it generated ."
"`` how can you sleep at night knowing that you 're going to put so many people out of work ?"
"their skills are specialized to maccomber 's needs !"
"they wo n't be able to find work and the whole town will die out . ''"
"nik stopped sifting through the documents and looked right at her ."
"`` if you do n't want the town to die out , then perhaps you should be at my apartment tonight and be ready for dinner ."
"this is not my decision , tabitha , '' he said firmly ."
"`` if you want to save your precious village , then agree to my terms . ''"
"he looked down at his watch ."
"`` and your deadline is over ."
"i need an answer immediately . ''"
"she shivered at the hard steel behind his voice ."
"her anger was replaced by panic that was so overwhelming , she was almost physically ill. `` you ca n't mean this !"
"you ca n't really be putting an ultimatum on me in this manner . ''"
"`` on the contrary ."
"i am very definitely putting this on you ."
"what will it be ?"
"yes or no ? ''"
"`` no , '' she gasped , holding her purse against her chest in a defensive manner , as if the slim , leather could block out is hateful words and offer ."
"he immediately turned around and picked up the phone ."
"`` john , go ahead with the contracts ."
"maccomber industries is on the market effective immediately . ''"
"`` no ! ''"
"tabitha said , rushing over and slamming her finger onto the button that would disconnect the conversation ."
"`` you ca n't mean that . ''"
"`` it is done , '' he said ominously ."
"`` if you 'll excuse me , i have another meeting , '' he said and moved around the desk toward the door ."
"`` wait ! ''"
"she shouted , the panic almost overwhelming her ."
"he turned around and faced her , one eyebrow raised in inquiry ."
"`` fine !"
"i 'll do it , '' she stammered out , unsure of any alternative ."
"she had tried to convince him , reach his better nature but apparently , the man did n't have one ."
"`` how long ?"
"when does it start ?"
"what are the terms ? ''"
"she said , her face blushing at the idea of what she was about to embark upon ."
"in response , he walked back over to his desk and picked up the phone again ."
"`` john , hold off for now ."
"but be on standby . ''"
"turning to tabitha , she shrank from the look of victory in his eyes ."
"`` you wo n't regret this , tabitha ."
"i can guarantee that you 'll find me a very generous lover , '' he said , touching her skin , his thumb rubbing along her lower lip ."
"`` as for how long , until i tire of you ."
"it starts immediately and the terms are that you follow all my instructions without question ."
"when the affair is over , you 'll own the company outright ."
"you 'll be able to run the company as you see fit without the interference of that tired , pathetic , old fashioned board of directors to hinder you . ''"
"she gasped , terrified of everything he said ."
"`` now ?"
"immediately ? ''"
"of all the words he 'd just spoken , those were the only ones that registered in her foggy , panic muddled mind ."
"`` yes . ''"
"he walked over to his desk and pressed a button ."
"`` elaine , cancel my appointments this afternoon and call zeth , tell him we 're on our way over ."
"also make reservations at anthony 's for dinner . ''"
"he released the button and walked back to her ."
"`` ready to go ? ''"
"`` go where ? ''"
"`` for clothes , '' he said simply and put a hand to the small of her back , guiding her out of the office ."
"`` clothes ? ''"
"she asked , feeling silly for repeating everything he said to her ."
"`` of course , '' he replied ."
"`` i do n't want you dressing like that ."
"too conservative , '' he replied , looking up and down her simple black suit with the cream silk shirt underneath ."
"`` i 'd like to see you in brighter colors ; dresses and outfits that will enhance your looks , not cover them up , '' he said simply and efficiently as if this was standard operating procedures for his girlfriends and lovers ."
"`` i 'll pick out a new wardrobe for you ."
"you 'll also have credit cards , but i reserve the right to reject things you purchase if they do n't suit me . ''"
"`` you 're kidding ? ''"
"`` i never kid , '' he said and pressed the button for the elevator which immediately appeared ."
"she could n't help but ask , `` do you do this for all of the women in your life ? ''"
"they were alone in the elevator and his height gave him a scary appearance with the shadows of the dim lighting in the cab ."
"`` of course , '' he said easily ."
"tabitha did n't ask any other questions ."
"she did n't want to know how he treated his other women ."
"she hated being part of the crowd and in this case , it was a very big crowd , she suspected ."
"a limousine was waiting at the entrance to the building with a bulky man holding the back door open ."
"they rode over to an exclusive boutique and tabitha , who had always had the very best clothes in the village , was shocked at how outrageous the prices were ."
"they were seated in the back of the store and served tea while the manager , who was obviously named zeth and fawned all over tabitha , clapped his hands and a procession of women walked out , each of them wearing breathtaking gowns in every shade of the rainbow ."
"tabitha sat in a satin covered chair and watched as the beautiful dresses passed by her , noting that nik nodded several times ."
"suits , day dresses , bathing suits , casual outfits and sporty little short skirts were paraded in front of her ."
"tabitha had no idea what was going on but she could tell that nik was buying more outfits than she 'd ever owned in her life ."
"and whereas her current wardrobe consisted of feminine but very conservative suits and day dresses , these outfits were anything but conservative ."
"all were within good taste , but were meant to entice and enhance ."
"after an hour of choosing dresses , nik stood up ."
"`` send whatever accessories are needed for the outfits to this address , '' he said , handing zeth a card , `` and she 'll change into that one now , '' he explained , pointing to a red silk dress that wrapped at the waist , forming a deep v at the neckline and flaring out at the waist to a full skirt ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"tabitha asked , staring at the incredibly beautiful model that was currently wearing the dress ."
"`` i do n't think i 'll look as good in that style as she does , '' she said warily ."
"`` nonsense ."
"you 'll look great in it . ''"
"his eyes looked down at hers , challenging her to say no ."
"tabitha considered it for all of two seconds , then thought better of it ."
"he only wanted her in a dress ."
"she really should save her battles for something larger ."
"like sex for the first time ."
"sighing deeply , she went back to a dressing room ."
"pulling on the red silk was like changing her skin ."
"gone was the professional looking suit with the conservative black wool that barely skimmed her figure ."
"the red silk clung to her breasts , actually showing a large part of her bra ."
"one of the sales ladies smiled secretly and handed her a red silk bra that was barely anything at all ."
"`` this might work better , '' she said and winked conspiratorially ."
"tabitha took off the dress again and changed out of her bra ."
"she was startled when a hand appeared with another piece of red lace ."
"`` since you 're wearing the bra , here is the matching pair of underwear ."
"you will probably feel better if you 're more coordinated everywhere , '' the voice of the sales clerk said ."
"tabitha took the scrap of lace and raised it up to her eyes to determine the best way to get into them ."
"at least it was n't a thong , she told herself ."
"pulling off her sensible cotton underwear , she slipped into the lace panties and surveyed her image in the mirror ."
"the lace covered her completely in the front , looking like a very short pair of shorts ."
"but her bottom was uncovered slightly at the edge , as if to reveal just a taste , to tease the observer ."
"wearing the underwear made her feel wicked and incredibly sexy ."
"did she want to do that ?"
"knowing everything that was probably going to happen tonight , she was n't so sure ."
"but should n't she prepare herself ?"
"these scraps of lace certainly gave her confidence , something severely lacking in her right at the moment ."
"shrugging her shoulders , she pulled the red silk back over her shoulders and looped the long belt around her small waist , tying the bow at the side just as the model had done ."
"when she looked up , she was surprised at how different she looked ."
"the lace bra allowed more of her cleavage to show ."
"it was n't indecent , but definitely sexy ."
"the lace of her panties did n't show through the fabric so much as made her move in a completely different way ."
"swirling the dress around her legs , she admired her image in the mirror ."
"seeing her reflection , she wondered if nik would think her pretty and sexy in the dress ."
"how could he not ?"
"she smiled and tabitha thought that even her smile had changed with the new clothes ."
"it was more subtle but she could see the anticipation in her eyes , the hope that perhaps she was sexy ?"
"maybe the other men in her life had been wrong and she was pretty and worthwhile ?"
"that thought stunned her ."
"she wanted nik to find her sexy ?"
"was she insane ?"
"he had bought her in a completely business-like fashion and she was excited about letting him see her in this dress ?"
"shaking her head at her completely inappropriate thoughts , she quickly folded her suit and stacked them neatly in a pile , hoping the staff could send them with her new clothes to whatever address nik had given them ."
"stepping out of the dressing room , there were three sales people plus zeth waiting to help her with anything else she might need ."
"as soon as she saw them , she noticed four sets of eyes widen in surprise ."
"`` is it that bad ? ''"
"she asked , looking down and pulling the v on her neckline closed slightly ."
"it did n't do any good , the silk simply fell right back to the original place where it had been hugging her breasts before the tug ."
"`` darling , you look smashing ! ''"
"zeth said ."
"`` i think i 'm going to have to take that dress off the market ."
"no one else will look as good in it as you so what 's the point ? ''"
"he said , waving his hand in the air dramatically ."
"the other three women nodded , smiling as if they knew some sort of secret ."
"zeth rushed forward , carrying a pair of red sandals in his right hand and a red purse in the other ."
"`` here you go , lovey ! ''"
"tabitha pulled on the strappy red sandals and changed the contents of her black purse for the red one ."
"`` i guess i should get out there and see how nik likes the dress , eh ? ''"
"she suggested ."
"`` darling , do n't you worry about him ."
"he said for you to meet him at picolo 's down the street . ''"
"`` he did n't even wait for me ? ''"
"why were her feelings hurt by his action ?"
"zeth shook his head and laughed ."
"`` he had some call and started speaking in a language i 've never heard of and took off ."
"the car is waiting for you as well as your security detail though . ''"
"`` security detail ? ''"
"she asked , sounding dazed ."
"`` yes ."
"some big , bulky guy that 's been standing by the door for the past two hours and glaring at anyone who tried to walk into this dressing room ."
"`` oh ."
"well , '' she said , trying to find that confidence she 'd discovered so briefly in the dressing room , `` i guess i should be on my way to that restaurant you mentioned . ''"
"`` knock him dead ! ''"
"one of the sales girls said and raised her thumb upwards ."
"tabitha smiled and climbed into the back of the waiting limousine ."
"a few minutes later , the car pulled to a stop outside a very elegant restaurant and the doorman immediately opened the back of the car ."
"carefully stepping out in her new high heeled sandals , tabitha smiled her thanks and walked into the restaurant ."
"the maitre 'd led her to one of the best tables in the house where nik was already sitting with several other men , intently discussing something she did n't understand ."
"nik had watched her walk across the restaurant and was furious ."
"he noticed the red dress he 'd chosen immediately but had had no idea what the silk would do to her figure ."
"before , she 'd definitely had male attention , being lovely by herself ."
"but now , in the red silk , clinging to every one of her soft , feminine curves , she was stunning and almost every male in the room had stopped to watch her walk , as well as many of the females who glared jealously at her spectacular figure ."
"he was sitting with several business associates , all of whom were trying to politely look at nik but were unable to tear their attention from tabitha and her new togs ."
"nik stood up abruptly and pulled out her chair , nodding to her before sitting down again ."
"he continued the conversation , pulling everyone 's attention back to him and not bothering to introduce her to the other gentlemen at the table ."
"he simply wanted the meeting over and done with quickly so they would stop looking at her ."
"the meeting ended and nik nodded , indicating that the other men should leave immediately , which they all understood and followed his unspoken command ."
"when they were finally alone , nik watched her as she fiddled nervously with her water glass ."
"`` quite the transformation , '' he said , taking a long swallow of his own ice water ."
"his body wanted her immediately ."
"he had no understanding of how she could tempt him with her lush body , but it was true ."
"she was n't the most beautiful woman he 'd ever been with ."
"but there was definitely an air about her , something that told the world that she was untouchable , unreachable ."
"but he would touch her , he promised himself ."
"soon ."
"in the meantime , he wanted to savor the power he currently had over her ."
"he knew she 'd had too much power over him for the past several years ."
"turning the tables was a heady experience ."
"`` why are you looking at me like that ? ''"
"she asked , her voice breaking on her nervousness ."
"`` you look lovely , '' he said ."
"`` all the other men in the restaurant are looking at you ."
"why not me as well ? ''"
"tabitha blushed at his almost backhanded compliment , embarrassed by the hungry look in his eyes ."
"`` you 're being silly , '' she said , shaking her head ."
"`` am i ? ''"
"he countered ."
"`` look around you . ''"
"tabitha did and she noticed several men turn their heads away when she caught their stares ."
"it scared her and she unconsciously moved closer to him , her body turning so she was almost protected by his arms ."
"`` can we go ? ''"
"she asked softly ."
"`` why would you want to do that ? ''"
"he asked , somehow feeling mollified that she 'd turned to him ."
"he was n't sure if she was even aware of it ."
"she probably was , he told himself cynically ."
"she knew all the tricks in the book and was a master at playing men to make them feel special ."
"lord knows she 'd done that well enough during the first round ."
"`` you should bask in your glory , revel in the power you have over men and count your conquests . ''"
"`` stop it , '' she said nervously , dipping her head lower ."
"`` i do n't like this ."
"could we please go ?"
"or could i put on a sweater ? ''"
"she crossed her arms self-consciously around herself , but knew she was n't able to cover herself adequately ."
"she 'd felt so pretty in the dress only a few minutes earlier ."
"but all the men 's attentions had made her feel awkward , exposed ."
"`` no ."
"you need to eat something ."
"i doubt you ate anything for breakfast and it is already two o'clock . ''"
"`` i 'm not really hungry , '' she argued , wanting only to get out of the stares of the people around her ."
"`` could n't we just leave ? ''"
"nik sat forward and looked down into her eyes ."
"`` we can go back to my place . ''"
"`` fine , '' she said without thinking and stood up ."
"nik followed her out , tossing some bills on the table to cover the lunch tab and tip ."
"he glared at several men who were a little too obvious in their admiration for her ."
"and even that action on his part bothered him ."
"he had wanted this , wanted her to be objectified ."
"why was he now getting angry when other men thought it was okay to look her over like she was some sort of prize at an auction ?"
"back in the coolness of the limousine , he instructed his driver to take them back to his penthouse and then turned to face tabitha ."
"`` so what have you been doing for the past several years ? ''"
"he asked conversationally ."
"tabitha was n't fooled ."
"`` do n't you already know ? ''"
"`` no ."
"i only know the bare facts ."
"tell me what you 've been doing ."
"what has occupied your time besides conquering the male population of the local villages ? ''"
"tabitha wriggled uncomfortably ."
"`` i do n't conquer males ."
"in fact , i do n't really have much to do with them at all . ''"
"`` despite all evidence to the contrary , '' he replied cynically ."
"`` is n't that the pot calling the kettle black ?"
"not that i 'm admitting to your accusation , though . ''"
"`` it is curious that you would consider that an accusation ."
"perhaps you under sell yourself ?"
"no one willing to buy your charms for as high a price as your late husband ? ''"
"`` do n't call him that ! ''"
"she snapped ."
"that raised his eyebrows in surprise ."
"`` testy , '' he replied ."
"`` why ? ''"
"`` jerry maxwell was nothing of what a husband should be . ''"
"`` what , exactly , are your requirements for a perfect husband ?"
"i 'd be very interested to hear them . ''"
"tabitha was taken aback by the turn of the conversation but it was much better than some other possibilities ."
"`` i do n't think i have a recipe for a perfect spouse , but i 'm sure companionship would be at the top of the list . ''"
"`` i 'm guessing from your scathing tone , that you did not receive companionship from your late husband . ''"
"`` i asked you not to call him that , '' she said angrily ."
"`` but no ."
"jerry and i did n't share much of anything . ''"
"`` except a home and a bed and a set of wedding rings ."
"minor things in your peculiar world , i suppose . ''"
"she closed her eyes briefly before opening them and staring out the window ."
"`` do n't assume anything , nik . ''"
"he could n't know how painful this conversation was and she had no intention of letting him see how he was hurting her ."
"she refused to give him any additional power ."
"he had too much already ."
"he only smiled at her prickly response , making her feel strange and the butterflies started to flutter more frantically ."
"`` and your other requirements for a satisfying marriage ? ''"
"tabitha huffed ."
"`` i do n't know exactly what i 'd like in a marriage ."
"but i can guarantee that it was n't received with jerry . ''"
"`` pity , '' was all he said ."
"it only took a few minutes to reach an underground parking garage ."
"he led her to a private elevator that immediately whisked them to the penthouse ."
"there , tabitha gasped in pleasure at the stunning view from his windows ."
"`` this is where you live ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` when i 'm in london , '' he said ."
"she turned away from the view to look at him , the smile of delight still on her face ."
"`` what do you mean ? ''"
"`` i do n't stay in one place very long ."
"in fact , tomorrow we leave for paris . ''"
"she was curious despite her need to stay aloof ."
"`` what will you be doing in paris ? ''"
"nik smiled but there was a sensual look to his eyes ."
"`` i have several meetings ."
"you , on the other hand , will be enticing me away from those meetings , hopefully . ''"
"tabitha blushed and turned away to stare out the window ."
"thankfully , the phone rang at that moment and he picked up his cell phone ."
"`` hello ? ''"
"he answered , then started speaking in french , a language tabitha only had a small amount of knowledge in so she was unable to follow the conversation ."
"she wandered over to a comfortable looking sitting area complete with a sofa and two overstuffed chairs surrounding a plasma screen television ."
"with nothing else to do , she curled up on the sofa , tucking her feet underneath her and turned on the tv ."
"after a sleepless night and all the tension of the day , she was exhausted ."
"within thirty minutes , she was asleep ."
"tabitha did n't wake until the following morning ."
"but she was no longer on the sofa ."
"in fact , she was no longer dressed ."
"looking under the smooth , cotton sheets , she realized she was wearing only her red , lace underwear ."
"gasping , she looked around for nik but did n't see him anywhere ."
"she stilled and listened , but there were no sounds coming from anywhere in the penthouse ."
"looking around , she started to see more of nik 's masculine personality coming out in the decor ."
"the bedroom was enormous with beautiful , antique furnishings and a huge bed covered with a blue damask comforter ."
"she felt like royalty as she looked around ."
"had she slept alone ?"
"no , she told herself , noticing the indentation on the pillow next to her ."
"there was also a cell phone with a note ."
"`` call me when you wake ."
"n. '' was all it said ."
"tabitha opened the phone and searched through the phone numbers ."
"sure enough , a number labeled `` nik '' was already programmed into the memory ."
"she pressed the number and held her breath , remembering the last time she had called nik 's cell phone and a woman had answered ."
"if that was the case this time , she was n't sure what she would do ."
"but thankfully , his deep voice answered the phone with a simple , `` ne ? ''"
"`` nik ? ''"
"she asked , not understanding anything of his native greek language ."
"`` good morning , '' he said quickly ."
"`` i hope you are completely rested today . ''"
"`` yes ."
"thank you for asking . ''"
"`` so polite ! ''"
"he chuckled ."
"`` i 'm asking since i wanted to warn you that i will not be so patient tonight ."
"if you are tired , i will definitely wake you ."
"having you in my arms all night was too much of a temptation for any man to endure twice , tabitha . ''"
"she cleared her throat and closed her eyes ."
"`` i understand . ''"
"there was a small , pregnant pause before he said , `` do you ? ''"
"`` yes , '' she said , nodding her head despite the fact that he could n't see her ."
"`` you 're telling me that our deal that started yesterday will be consummated tonight , regardless of my feelings or physical needs . ''"
"`` on the contrary , '' he countered ."
"`` i will ensure that your physical needs are at the top of my list to satisfy , '' he said and laughed softly ."
"`` but you are correct in the fact that our deal will be consummated today ."
"but in the mean time , a driver is waiting to take you to the airport ."
"wear something sexy . ''"
"without another word , the line was disconnected ."
"tabitha stared at the phone angrily ."
"she considered all her options but then thought of the villagers and all that they 've gone through ."
"it was n't fair to them ."
"she 'd put them into this situation by not being more assertive ."
"so basically , this was her penance ."
"shoving the sheets aside , she crawled out of bed and headed toward what she suspected was the bathroom ."
"showering helped her feel better and she tucked a towel around her and strolled to the closet ."
"the first one was filled with men 's clothes ."
"the next contained the clothes nik had chosen for her yesterday ."
"she fingered through all the items , her mind whirling with the possibilities ."
"she loved clothes but had never chosen things this risque ."
"but , if she only considered nik 's reaction , she could n't deny how pretty and sexy she had felt walking into the restaurant yesterday , seeing the look of heat enter his eyes had been incredibly powerful ."
"she liked that ."
"she had n't liked the other males ' attention but they would be in more private places today she hoped ."
"pulling out a suit , she considered her options ."
"the jacket looked severe enough , she told herself ."
"and if she wore the silk shirt underneath , with a lace bra ... .taking off the jacket at just the right time might give her a little more leverage ."
"but did she have the courage ?"
"the silk was very delicate ."
"he 'd initially be angry that the outfit did n't fit his `` sexy '' definition ."
"smiling wickedly , she knew she was going to do it ."
"drying her hair , she pulled it so the soft curls were piled on top of her head with only a few drifting down around her face ."
"pulling on the skirt , she realized that it was n't as conservative as she 'd originally thought ."
"hanging on the hanger , the soft black wool material looked like an ordinary straight skirt ."
"but when she pulled it over her hips and zipped it up , she realized that it was made partly of a fabric that helped it stretch , so the fabric was tight around her hips ."
"searching through the drawers , she eventually found what she was looking for ."
"pulling off the regular lace underwear she 'd originally chosen , she pulled on a tiny thong , then smoothed the black wool back down over her hips ."
"turning , she realized that it appeared that she was not wearing any underwear at all ."
"good !"
"she chose a demi cup bra that barely covered her nipples , then smoothed the luxurious silk over her shoulders ."
"smiling , she realized it had the exact effect she was hoping for ."
"put together , the suit was completely appropriate for the board room ."
"but the lace bra showing discreetly through the silk was , in her mind , dangerously enticing ."
"she applied a light amount of makeup then stepped back to review her appearance in the full length mirror ."
"perfect !"
"she looked like any business woman who might walk into the board room ."
"but taking off her jacket , she turned into a sex kitten out to entice ."
"he wanted sexy !"
"she 'd give him sexy !"
"she pulled on a pair of stiletto shoes and walked out ."
"nik 's driver drove her directly to the airport with jimmy , her body guard right behind her as she walked through the terminal ."
"apparently , this was a private plane so she was able to avoid security and the process was much easier and faster ."
"boarding the plane , tabitha ensured that her jacket was securely fastened before taking her seat in the jet ."
"nik boarded moments later with several men behind him ."
"all of them were carrying large briefcase and looked very serious ."
"the plane was really a huge , flying office ."
"there was a large conference area in the back where the men moved off to sit ."
"the middle held smaller tables and chairs and the front was luxuriously appointed with a sofa , fully stocked bar and entertainment center ."
"as soon as nik was seated , the plane took off ."
"within moments , they were leveling out and nik started the conference with the men in the back ."
"tabitha picked up a magazine and ignored the entire situation although she nervously considered when she would take off her jacket ."
"she would never have the nerve to do so in front of all those men ."
"so she simply leaned back and read through article after article , bored when they continued to talk ."
"in paris , they landed and nik walked up to her ."
"`` i have meetings this afternoon ."
"here is some money , '' he said , handing her several large bills ."
"`` go out and have a good time ."
"jimmy will take care of you ."
"i 'll meet you tonight , '' he said and disappeared down the stairs ."
"tabitha was completely put out ."
"why on earth was she flying with him if all he was going to do was sit through meetings ?"
"was it only a power thing ?"
"of course it was !"
"he wanted to know he could command her and order her about for pointless reasons ."
"getting out of the plane , she walked down the stairs and ignored the men who were standing in the hot sunshine ."
"she took off her jacket , irritated that she was even going to try and entice nik ."
"feeling silly for her plan , she tossed her jacket in the back of the limousine , then ducked in herself ."
"nik watched tabitha disembark from the plane ."
"he 'd been distracted all morning , wondering what she was reading ."
"he 'd been hard pressed to pay attention to whatever the others were saying and so had extended the discussion , as if proving to himself that he was in control ."
"he would n't go over to her no matter how lonely and bored she looked ."
"she deserved it ."
"she 'd married herself off to a rich man and now she was a mistress to a rich man ."
"well this was what his life was like , he told himself ."
"seeing the sun glint off her hair made his eyes stare ."
"he actually had to grit his teeth as desire hit him hard ."
"the skirt she was wearing was n't as boring as he 'd originally thought ."
"the fabric clung to her hips and thighs , her derriere was nicely rounded and he had a perfect view of all her curves ."
"but when she took off the jacket and he saw what she was wearing underneath , he almost punched the man speaking to him , irritated that someone would dare to interrupt that perfect moment as he viewed the sexy lace underneath the luxurious silk shirt ."
"looking around after the car drove off , he was still feeling furious when he noticed that others within the group had noticed , and they were still staring after the rapidly disappearing car ."
"restraining himself from physical violence , he ducked into his own limousine and stared out the window , reviewing his plans for the day ."
"he 'd originally planned several meetings for the rest of the afternoon , then dinner with tabitha and then to his paris apartment ."
"that would have to change now ."
"he 'd arrange for his cook to prepare dinner in house , he could cancel his last meeting and be back in only a few hours ."
"calling jimmy , he told him of his change in plans , noting with satisfaction that the man simply complied with his new agenda ."
"glancing at his watch , nik shifted uncomfortably in his seat ."
"this was a new feeling , to be distracted by a woman ."
"no , he corrected himself ."
"he 'd done it once before , four years ago ."
"nik had canceled and rearranged several meetings that week , calling conference calls and having his helicopter fly him in and out of london constantly ."
"just to be around tabitha ."
"and then to realize that she was a fake and he the fool who had happily gone about dancing to her tune ."
"no more !"
"five hours later , nik stormed into his paris penthouse , furious with himself for his inability to control the rampaging desire that had taken over his body earlier that morning , as well as the woman who had initiated that fury ."
"not only had he adjusted his previously rigorous schedule after seeing tabitha depart in the limousine earlier that day ."
"he had also canceled several other meetings then phoned jimmy to ensure that she was back where he could vent his anger at her ."
"but as he stood in the white marble foyer , his steps faltered and eventually came to a complete halt ."
"standing against the vivid backdrop of the city of paris in springtime , was the woman who had occupied his thoughts almost constantly for the past several weeks , stirring his body to a state of arousal on so many occasions and generally at the most inopportune moments ."
"he watched in amazement and almost mind-boggling suspense as she reached her slender arms up and pulled the pins from her softly curling hair , allowing the unencumbered masses to waft gently down against her delicate shoulders ."
"he could n't see her face , but the outline of her body , her curves , lit the fire that had been smoldering all afternoon ."
"walking forward , he was almost transfixed by the sight of her as she rubbed her shoulders , lifted her hair up and gently kneaded her neck muscles as if she had been concentrating on issues of great import all afternoon but had finally realized that it was time to relax and delve into the evening and mindlessness ."
"nik agreed ."
"it was definitely time to stop thinking ."
"all he wanted was to pull her into his arms , kiss her pouty mouth and imprint himself onto her consciousness so she could think of no other man ."
"reaching her , his steps slowed as he allowed the soft , feminine scent of her to waft into his nostrils ."
"it was n't perfume he smelled , but something much more subtle , more unidentifiable and therefore , much more alluring ."
"his hand slowly slid up her spine and he smiled as she jumped and spun around ."
"`` nik ! ''"
"she gasped , dropping her hands to her sides and taking a step back ."
"`` i did n't know you 'd come in , '' she said , looking around ."
"when she saw no one else in the penthouse with them , her anxiety ridden eyes snapped back to his darker , more mysterious gaze ."
"`` where 's jimmy ? ''"
"she asked nervously , worried about what would happen next ."
"`` gone , '' he said simply and took her hands in his , lacing her fingers with his own and pulling her gently forward ."
"`` why on earth would you send him away ? ''"
"she asked nervously , resisting the pull of his hands ."
"but nik was relentless ."
"`` he was going to check the kitchen for the other staff . ''"
"nik brought her forward several inches , then dropped her fingers , wrapping his arms around her waist as a more efficient method of getting her where he wanted her to be , touching him from knee to shoulder ."
"`` he was no longer needed , '' nik replied in answer to her question ."
"`` but i was hungry , '' she countered warily ."
"she was n't , at least not anymore ."
"she was terrified and that fear eclipsed whatever minor hunger pains had been gnawing at her a moment ago ."
"`` i 'll make sure you 're every need is fulfilled , '' he said a moment before his mouth captured hers ."
"he felt her lips tremble initially and slowed down , not wanting their first time together to be rushed ."
"this woman had been the star of so many fantasies over the past several years , he wanted to make sure each of them were realized ."
"his lips caressed , nibbled enticed and teased until he felt her relax slightly ."
"then he pulled her closer , his other arm wrapping around her shoulders to press her soft breasts against his chest ."
"he imagined he could feel the lace of her bra through the silk of her shirt but knew that was impossible ."
"he was still wearing his business suit for starters ."
"but he 'd thought about that bra for so many hours , remembered the red lace she 'd worn the night before as she 'd wrapped her arms around his waist , holding onto him as if she had been afraid he would leave ."
"so finally having her exactly where he wanted her , and awake , he could be excused for imagining something that was probably impossible ."
"he would feel it and see it soon enough ."
"and he 'd feel that lace not through his shirt and hers , but against his skin and under his fingertips ."
"pulling the silk shirt free from the waistband of her skirt , his fingers skimmed lightly across her satin skin , enjoying the soft gasp that came from her throat ."
"deepening the kiss , he pushed his tongue into her mouth , caressing her tongue , enticing her to mimic his movements ."
"she was the perfect student and , just as she had so many years ago , she knew exactly how to react to him , muttering soft moans and gasps , whimpering when his hand moved higher ."
"her arms finally reached up and wrapped around his neck , pulling him closer , just as he remembered her doing during their first kiss ."
"her back arched as his hand went higher ."
"he was tempted to release the clasp to her bra , freeing her full , perfect breasts for his touch , but his mind was clamoring for a sight of her body in the lace ."
"the lace that he 'd bought ."
"he was all hers , every inch of her and everything that covered her , he 'd provided ."
"the thought was heady and only intensified the heat scorching his body ."
"nik released the closure of her skirt , allowing the fabric to skim down her hips and pool at her feet ."
"when his hands ventured lower , he almost lost the control he 'd been fighting for all day when his palm touched bare skin ."
"the tiny string crossing her back made him haul her closer , higher against his aching need ."
"giving in to the desire , he swung her up into his arms and carried her into the bedroom ."
"standing next to the bed , he lowered her slowly to the floor , his mouth covering hers again , pulling her body close , then stepping away and pulling the silk blouse off her ."
"he stood , staring at her in the creamy lace bra and thong underwear , her feet still in the stiletto heels and his mind simply stopped functioning ."
"`` you 're more beautiful than i ever imagined , '' he said , his voice hoarse ."
"tabitha stood in front of nik , her mind had turned to mush about fifteen minutes ago , about the same time his strong , lean fingers touched her skin ."
"when he only stood in front of her , his business jacket still on , something inside her snapped ."
"she could no longer take the torment from him and moved forward , pushing the perfectly tailored material off his broad shoulders ."
"his tie came off just as quickly but she had no idea where it landed and her fingers trembled with need and urgency as they worked the buttons on his shirt ."
"when his chest was finally bared to her hungry gaze , she reached up and tentatively touched his chest ."
"the scattering of hair was mesmerizing , as were the muscles underneath ."
"she had n't bothered to push it off , but when the fabric got in her way , she ripped further , her curious mind demanding to know all ."
"she heard a groan but paid little attention to it until his hands reached up and clasped her own ."
"she felt the soft mattress beneath her shoulders and her eyes implored him to follow ."
"but he stopped and tabitha was able to watch in fascination as he pulled off his pants , standing in front of her in only his boxers ."
"a moment later , he was completely , uninhibitedly naked in front of her and the full extent of his manhood stood proudly at the juncture of his hips ."
"he was incredible , like nothing she 'd ever imagined before ."
"looking up , she caught his gaze which then pinned her to the bed ."
"`` i want you , '' he said roughly and came down on top of her , his arms holding his weight as his mouth came down to cover her nipple , tasting , teasing , nipping gently at the center before licking to sooth the ache ."
"tabitha cried out , her hands gripping his shoulders as the tidal wave of desire tore through her body , flooding her senses so she was aching with a need she did n't understand ."
"her fingers sliced into his hair , both holding his head to her breast , yet also needing to pull him away , to stop the fire that was building to a painful intensity she did n't understand ."
"when he finally pulled away , his head moved , but only so his mouth could cover the other nipple ."
"her hips rocked , her back arched but nothing would relieve the ache in her stomach , in every cell of her body ."
"when his hand moved downwards , she grabbed his wrist , her head shaking in fear ."
"`` no , please ! ''"
"she pleaded with him ."
"`` i do n't understand , '' she said , unable to even voice her confusion ."
"`` yes , '' he rasped , grabbing her hands with his other , holding both of hers up over her head as his hand moved down , exploring her skin , grazing along her outer thighs , then moving insistently up the insides ."
"her thighs opened , somehow understanding what her mind could n't comprehend and his mouth smiled in appreciation for her body 's reception ."
"his fingers moved slowly , relentlessly upwards , teasing and fluttering until she groaned and closed her eyes ."
"when his fingers moved inside her , she arched again , instinctively moving against his fingers and her body , so new to these startling sensations , climaxed almost instantly ."
"her eyes squeezed shut as her body convulsed , then slowly floated back down to earth ."
"but there was no escape ."
"nik would not allow her to stop ."
"as soon as her body slowed , his mouth returned to her breast , teasing her right back to the frantic state she had been in only moments before ."
"his mouth moved from her breast to her stomach , his tongue and teeth exploring her body , tasting and finding new ways to increase the tension to a higher level than before ."
"a tear escaped her eyes and she wanted to fight him , needing him but not wanting the almost painful pleasure his hands were delivering with each , unerring touch to her skin ."
"`` nik ! ''"
"she cried out ."
"`` please no more , '' she begged ."
"`` i ca n't take it anymore ! ''"
"he was gone for only a moment , returning to place the condom on his erection ."
"then he pulled her hands back over her head and pushed himself gently between her thighs ."
"`` look at me , tabitha , '' he demanded , his body moving against hers , eliciting yet another gasp of pleasure before she complied with his order ."
"as she opened her eyes to watch , she noticed the perspiration on his forehead and the glistening on his shoulders ."
"wrapping her legs around his hips , she begged with her eyes , pleading with him to end the torture ."
"with one , strong urgent thrust , he pushed himself into her heat ."
"instantly , the pain tore through her and she cringed , pulling back to avoid the pain again ."
"nik froze , his eyes looking into hers and revealing the shock his invasion caused ."
"`` tabitha ? ''"
"he groaned , his body unable to move , just as the pleasure of her tight sheath clasped him even more into her core ."
"`` look at me , '' he said as softly as he could under the circumstances ."
"she shook her head and bit her lower lip ."
"`` please ."
"are we done yet ? ''"
"she asked , the strain of keeping still almost too much for her ."
"she wanted to move and every cell in her body was begging for release , but she did n't want to move for fear that the pain would return ."
"`` is it over ? ''"
"she asked when he did n't say anything ."
"`` no , '' he groaned ."
"`` i 'm sorry ."
"how ... ? ''"
"he started to ask , only to have her hand cover his mouth ."
"`` i 'm sorry , nik ."
"i 'm sure you have many questions but could n't you just ... . ''"
"she searched for the right words but nothing came to mind ."
"it was difficult to be eloquent at the moment ."
"`` finish ? ''"
"she said lamely ."
"nik put his head down onto her shoulder for a long moment , his breathing coming hard and his body aching for release ."
"but he stopped himself and looked back up at her ."
"`` if i 'd known ... '' he started to say ."
"`` but you did n't , '' she interrupted ."
"`` no ."
"i did n't , '' he said ."
"`` but i can make it better , '' he promised ."
"with a gentle movement , he showed her ."
"and tabitha 's eyes widened when there was no pain ."
"when he moved again , she actually felt good ."
"by the time he pulled almost all the way out , then gently moved back again , her body was back in the throes of desire , the need for release just as demanding as it had been before the invasion ."
"nik used every ounce of his control to slow the pace ."
"but her body moving against his felt too good and after several minutes , he could no longer hold back ."
"reaching down between their bodies , he helped her come to a climax that had her crying out and holding his shoulders , her nails digging into his skin ."
"a few minutes later , he too came in a climax that seemed to stop his heartbeat for several long minutes ."
"tabitha lay in the center of his arms , his head against her shoulder and the two of them intimately connected ."
"as reality slowly returned , she smiled , understanding dawning on her at last ."
"so this was sex ?"
"interesting ."
"no , fascinating , she told herself ."
"as he rolled onto his back , pulling her with him so she was draped across his chest , she marveled at the amazing feelings her body had experienced ."
"she wanted to laugh out loud , but was n't sure what the protocol was for this kind of thing ."
"nik looked up at her and she turned her face away , looking out the window , afraid he would ask questions or say something mean that would change this whole experience for her ."
"`` tabitha , did i mistake what just happened ? ''"
"he asked ."
"tabitha turned her head back and noticed he was staring at the ceiling ."
"`` i think we both had sex , '' she said and pulled out of his arms ."
"sitting up , she was immediately self conscious of her nakedness so she pulled the blanket from the bottom of the bed and wrapped it around herself , standing up and moving toward the bathroom ."
"`` tabitha ! ''"
"he called out to her , but she ignored him and continued on her search for a shower ."
"she opened one door and discovered it filled with clothes ."
"the next door , thankfully , was the bathroom ."
"the bathroom was done in black marble and all the fixtures were ultra modern ."
"turning on the shower , she shivered , afraid he would follow her and wondering how she was going to get out of the conversation ."
"she did n't want anyone to know about her horrible marriage ."
"it was too humiliating ."
"she had just turned on the shower when nik walked in behind her ."
"pulling her back against his chest , he looked at her in the mirror ."
"`` you know i 'm going to get the answers one way or another , tabitha ."
"do n't you ? ''"
"she shivered and shook her head ."
"`` no ."
"that 's my own business ."
"it has nothing to do with the situation we 're currently in , '' she said and pulled out of his arms ."
"he allowed her to go but stood watching her as she dropped the blanket before stepping into the shower ."
"the warm spray smoothed her hair down against her back creating a slick look to the tresses that fascinated him ."
"gone were the thoughts about her marriage and her virginity ."
"gone also were the gentlemanly thoughts and guilt that had surged through him when he realized that she was untutored in the ways of sex ."
"all that consumed him was this driving need to posses her again ."
"in the past , women had interested him and some could even entice him sexually to a certain point ."
"but only to a point and only if it was convenient to him ."
"normally , he called the shots and said when and where ."
"but tabitha was different and for the life of him , he could n't figure out how to work her out of his system ."
"he wanted her again which was n't abnormal since he had a driving sexual appetite ."
"but this need for her was beyond what he was used to and comfortable with ."
"stepping into the shower , he took the soap from her hands and lathered her soft , silken skin ."
"he shampooed her hair all the while trying to maintain a cool distance from her ."
"but the soft sighs that came from her as he massaged her scalp and back were driving him crazy ."
"he had been hard when he 'd watched her walk across the room but now , he could no longer wait ."
"he had to have her ."
"lifting her up , he pushed her gently against the marble wall of the shower , rinsing her off as he took a nipple into his mouth ."
"he knew he should give her some time to recover , that she might be in pain ."
"but he did n't care ."
"he had to have her again ."
"he promised himself he would be extra gentle this time ."
"pushing into her , he slowed his pace enough to watch her reactions , noting with agonizing satisfaction that her eyes were closed tightly and her mouth was open , as if the pleasure were too much for her ."
"he knew how she felt ."
"feeling himself slide inside her , watching her reactions was pushing him to the edge ."
"he forced himself to slow ."
"but when he felt her start to convulse around him , he released his control and drove himself into her soft , yielding flesh , climaxing for a second time in less than a half hour ."
"they stayed like that for a long time , the warm water pulsing down on their skin as the reality of the situation came back to them ."
"he 'd never been so impatient to have made love in the shower , and against the wall ."
"but looking down into her smiling face , he knew he 'd definitely do this again ."
"`` are you okay ? ''"
"he asked , gently pushing her wet hair out of her face ."
"`` yes , '' she sighed , her arms limp around his shoulders ."
"`` definitely yes , '' she said and laid her head against his chest ."
"nik chuckled deeply and pulled her closer , hugging her slim body that seemed to fit against him as if she were made for him ."
"`` i 'd better get you out of here , '' he said and turned off the water ."
"he wrapped her into a large , fluffy white towel before pulling one around his waist ."
"`` what did you do today ? ''"
"he asked , startled that he genuinely wanted to hear how she 'd spent her afternoon ."
"`` oh , nik ! ''"
"she enthused , pulling the towel around her and tucking the corner under her arm ."
"`` i went to see notre dame and it was beautiful ."
"i was going to see the eifel tower but then jimmy got a phone call and he rushed me back here ."
"but still , it was thrilling to see things i 'd only heard about before . ''"
"nik looked down at her in confusion ."
"`` you 're father was not poor ."
"why did n't he ever take you to paris before ? ''"
"tabitha shrugged as she pulled a comb through her hair ."
"`` my father did n't like traveling ."
"i went to boarding school for high school and finishing school but even that was only to northern england and he did n't come with me to drop me off ."
"he simply handed me a train ticket and told me to get there on time . ''"
"nik did n't like her father , remembering the one conversation he 'd had with him ."
"but it still seemed odd that the man was so heartless to his daughter ."
"`` what was he like ? ''"
"nik asked against his better judgment ."
"tabitha 's smile disappeared and she put down the comb before walking away ."
"`` he was a good man , '' was all she would say ."
"how did one describe a father who had sold her to a man who had no interest in her simply to save his failing business ?"
"but was she any better ?"
"the idea stopped her in the middle of the bedroom ."
"she really was n't any better , she realized ."
"she was selling herself to nik just to save the business ."
"well , not really the business but all the people who supported the business , she corrected ."
"she did n't want the town to die and so here she was ."
"but was this really so bad ?"
"she was living a life more luxurious than she 'd ever imagined she could live , she was with the man she 'd fallen in love with several years ago and this time , the affair might last a little longer than the week she 'd had before ."
"should n't she be excited for this opportunity ?"
"she looked back at nik who was walking out of the bathroom ."
"he looked at her curiously , one dark eyebrow raised in question ."
"biting her lower lip , she considered the idea that had occurred to her ."
"could she do it ?"
"could she use nik the way her mind was asking her to use him ?"
"it had been so long since she 'd felt like a woman and the way nik liked her to dress , to walk and definitely the way he looked at her made her feel wanted and beautiful ."
"he was using her for his revenge purposes ."
"what was the difference ?"
"all she wanted was to feel pretty and sexy and maybe wanted sexually ."
"was that so wrong ?"
"and maybe she could learn to entice a man , show him that she was a real woman ."
"and perhaps she could prove it to herself in the process ."
"she watched as nik pulled on a pair of well worn jeans ."
"if she was going to learn anything , she could n't ask for a better teacher ."
"even now after her body had been satisfied twice with amazing results , watching him walk and comb his hair , she wanted him again ."
"she could feel her body react , her nipples harden and that secret place between her legs become liquid all over again ."
"turning away so he could n't see her face , she knew she was blushing with all the ideas that were singing through her brain ."
"why not ?"
"she was caught in this situation ."
"he was probably more than willing to teach her anything she wanted to know ."
"what would be the problem if he did n't know he was teaching her ?"
"`` are you hungry ? ''"
"nik asked from close behind her ."
"tabitha startled , swinging around as if she 'd been caught doing something naughty ."
"which , if he could read her mind , he 'd know she was ."
"`` excuse me ? ''"
"nik 's eyes looked down into her blue ones and knew she was hiding something ."
"the soft flush that stole across her cheeks confirmed it ."
"`` what are you thinking about ? ''"
"he demanded , catching her upper arm and turning her back to face him ."
"`` nothing , '' she said and looked straight ahead at his chest ."
"not a good idea with her current plans still formulating in her mind ."
"she looked out the window , assuming that was a safer idea ."
"`` i do n't think it was nothing ."
"but you 're probably not going to tell me , are you ? ''"
"he asked , trying to keep the anger from his tone ."
"the woman was going to drive him crazy with her little mysteries ."
"was she thinking about the other men she 'd had in her life ?"
"was she comparing him to them ?"
"no , that 's not possible , he thought to himself ."
"she had n't experienced them sexually ."
"so what had she been thinking , dammit !"
"he wished he could just walk away but she was slowly becoming an obsession he had to have ."
"tabitha smiled up at him , her eyes bright and cheerful and definitely wicked ."
"`` no ."
"i 'm not going to tell you , '' she laughed , delighted with her plans and deciding to go ahead with them ."
"she licked her lips and shook her head again ."
"`` but i can tell you that i 'm famished , '' she started only to see the smile creep into his eyes ... '' for food ! ''"
"she laughed , then wondered why she 'd stopped his mind from traveling down the path she was already on ."
"her body wanted him , why would she stop another lesson ?"
"she felt her cheeks heating once again and quickly spoke to distract him ."
"`` and you promised to satisfy all of my physical needs ."
"so what are you going to feed me ? ''"
"sighing , nik rolled his eyes , satisfied slightly now that she was looking at him instead of seeming to be thinking of someone else ."
"`` fine ."
"get some clothes on and meet me in the dining room ."
"i 'll see what the cook has made for dinner , '' he said and left the bedroom barefoot and bare chested ."
"chapter 5 tabitha looked across the palazzo and smiled , enjoying the heat of the early afternoon and the rush of people buzzing around busily ."
"florence was definitely a beautiful city , she thought as she felt the sun heat her face ."
"she had her book on her lap and was staring into space , not really caring about anything around her ."
"she and nik had left paris yesterday to arrive here in florence last night ."
"she had n't seen him much today and did n't expect to see him until the evening ."
"he 'd told her to dress up tonight but she had no idea what that meant ."
"jimmy was sitting at the next table pretending to not be there , and she was slowly learning to ignore his presence , although he was such a bulky man , it was hard to do at times ."
"when they were in the limousine together , he sat in the front seat , usually with the privacy screen closed ."
"when they walked , he maintained a few feet between the two of them , never getting close unless he was opening a door or if the street traffic was unusually heavy ."
"it was as if the man were deliberately keeping a distance from her ."

CHUNK 5:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"she 'd come to accept it but at times it still bothered her ."
"she felt like a nuisance ."
"on the other hand , she loved the fact that she had a car waiting for her convenience and nik had handed her a wallet this morning filled with credit cards and cash ."
"she did n't like that too much , feeling cheap and awkward ."
"but it was certainly nice to relax and enjoy sight seeing ."
"she 'd had no idea how much she liked to travel , not understanding her father 's insistence that it was too much trouble ."
"although traveling with nik was a completely different experience ."
"when he walked somewhere , no matter what city they were in , it was like moses parting the red sea ."
"people seemed to naturally move out of his way for him ."
"there was always a car , helicopter , plane or other transportation available and waiting on his convenience ."
"so perhaps normal travel would be annoying ."
"but she certainly liked this ."
"she also liked looking over at nik and finding him staring back at her ."
"on the plane , she 'd heard his voice and just knew that he was looking at her ."
"sure enough , when she 'd raised her head from the magazine to look around , his eyes were on her , his thumb rubbing along his jaw and she just knew that he was thinking about having sex with her ."
"the flush that had stolen through her body at that moment had caused a chuckle to come from him and she shifted uncomfortably in her leather chair , unable to maintain his gaze ."
"the conversations around the palazzo now were mostly in italian , so when she heard english , she was surprised and looked up , hiding her confusion behind the large cup of cappuccino she had ordered ."
"the two men were tossing out ideas on how to resolve a problem and tabitha 's stomach clenched , realizing that maccomber industries could help these men out at a lower cost than the numbers they were currently discussing ."
"could it really be that simple ?"
"tabitha was too excited for a moment , but when the men started to pull their papers together , as if they were finished with their brainstorming , tabitha decided it was better to be rude and wrong than to lose the opportunity ."
"`` excuse me , '' she said , standing up herself ."
"the two men looked down at her , initially surprised ."
"but then both smiled as they looked down at her petite form ."
"`` i 'm sorry to have eavesdropped on your conversation , but you might want to consider another idea ."
"it is cheaper and probably more efficient than what you were discussing , '' she said and the three of them sat down and she took out a paper to write some notes ."
"the men were eager for more information and tabitha , who had never been allowed in any meetings before her father 's death , was surprised at how much she actually knew about the factory and its operations ."
"the two men were considering a large issue and it would mean a big contract for maccomber if they decided to go with her idea ."
"even if they did n't go through with the contract , it was still thrilling to know that she could actually discuss the details of a project with potential clients intelligently ."
"when the men left , tabitha could only sit at the table , smiling like a silly little school girl who had just been kissed by her first boyfriend ."
"to complicate the issue , her first thought was to tell nik ."
"but would he even care ?"
"this could boost profits and revenue significantly , but nik 's whole purpose in buying the company was revenge on her ."
"pushing that thought aside , she decided to revel in her success and hold it close ."
"talking to nik would only crush her happiness , despite the fact that she desperately wanted to talk with him ."
"if he showed even the slightest indifference , it would diminish this wonderful feeling she had right now ."
"instead , she smiled to jimmy , who nodded in response , and decided to walk through the beautiful city , touring the sites ."
"for lunch , she bought some fruit at a roadside stand and continued walking , eager to see as much of the city as possible before she was called back by nik ."
"by the middle of the afternoon , she was staring up at the cathedral of santa maria del fiore , marveling at the beauty of the architecture and art ."
"the marble and chrome was astonishing and the enormous size of the building and piazza was a tribute to brunelleschi 's faith ."
"when the thought struck her that she wished she could tour this fabulous city with nik , she was concerned ."
"why on earth did she have the desire to share things with nik ?"
"he was wonderfully generous with her , handing her a wallet filled with cash and credit cards and a closet full of clothes that she 'd never find the time to wear in a year ."
"but this was beyond material things ."
"she wanted to experience things with him and get excited next to him as they viewed this city ."
"biting her lip in confusion , tabitha moved through the cathedral , impressed with the works of art but concerned about her feelings for a man she 'd known for a total of ten days out of her entire life ."
"the first five days had been blissful , but he had broken her heart and was now treating her like his mistress , or worse ."
"why did n't that bother her ?"
"was she willing to excuse his behavior simply because he made her feel things in bed that she 'd never felt , never wanted to feel , with another man ?"
"tabitha moved along , heading toward the academia gallery ."
"she stood in line for three hours but eventually , she was able to see the magnificent `` david '' ."
"stunned by the famous statue , her thoughts again turned to nik ."
"back out on the street , she turned to jimmy and sighed ."
"`` any idea what is on the agenda for the rest of the day ? ''"
"she asked ."
"jimmy took out his palm pilot and pressed a few buttons ."
"`` i believe kirios andretti will be attending the opera tonight ."
"would you like to return to the palazzo to prepare ? ''"
"tabitha considered the time ."
"it was already three o'clock in the afternoon ."
"`` i guess that would be fine , '' she said , wishing she did n't have to go to the opera ."
"she disliked that form of theatre , thinking that the actors were just screaming ."
"she could barely understand the words even if the songs were in english , which they rarely were ."
"`` what time is nik expected back ? ''"
"she asked ."
"`` not for several hours , '' he replied , his dark eyes not revealing any emotion or reaction ."
"`` okay ."
"i guess i 'd better start to get ready ."
"i need to get my nails done , do n't i ? ''"
"she asked , looking down at her nail polish that was now chipped in several places since she had n't received a manicure in three days ."
"with her thin nails , she needed to go without nail polish , which is what she 'd done before nik arrived in her life , or she needed to get a manicure every day ."
"tabitha allowed herself to be driven back to nik 's palazzo but she did n't really feel like dressing for the night ."
"she wanted to savor her day , hug it close to her and think about the possibilities ."
"unfortunately , nik had already returned when she walked in ."
"`` where the hell have you been ? ''"
"he demanded when he first caught sight of her ."
"instantly on the defensive , tabitha calmly put her purse down on a glass topped table and inhaled deeply , trying to not react to his anger ."
"`` i have been out touring the sites , '' she explained , crossing her arms over her chest ."
"`` who with ? ''"
"tabitha did n't like the way this conversation was heading ."
"`` jimmy , '' was all she said initially ."
"then with the doubtful look in his eyes , she asked , `` who did you think i was out with ? ''"
"`` i saw you at the piazza today ."
"you were sitting at a table with two men ."
"it looked rather cozy ."
"explain that to me ! ''"
"tabitha drew herself up to her full height , uncaring that he still towered over her by more than a foot ."
"`` no ."
"i 'm not explaining anything to you ! ''"
"she yelled at him , angry now that she was being accused of something ridiculous ."
"`` how in the world did you know where i was anyway ? ''"
